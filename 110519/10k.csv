Busines s Description Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing, services, retailing and other activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with government laws and regulations and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees. Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 383,000 people worldwide at the end of 2022, of which approximately 78% were in the United States (“U.S.”) and 20% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses individually establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within their organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature and size of business activities, specific policies and practices may vary widely among Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation, which includes various health insurance and retirement benefits, as well as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce. Berkshire’s consolidated U.S. workforce demographics, based on U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, are available on its website ( https://www.berkshirehathaway.com) , under sustainability. Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks and reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries employed approximately 50,000 people at the end of 2022. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers. In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. K- 1 Insurers based in the U.S. are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the “Insurance Capital Standard”) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standard based on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the “Aggregation Method”). The IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, U.S. state insurance departments and the NAIC are implementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. U.S. state regulators require insurance groups to file an annual report and an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAIC recently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the Aggregation Method, which leverages the NAIC’s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC’s group capital calculation is a tool designed to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the future. Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. The combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $272 billion at December 31, 2022. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in any calendar year. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. K- 2 In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2023 for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to approximate $2.25 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example: Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach. Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. In 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”), which resulted in the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the EU. Berkshire also continues to maintain a substantial presence in London following Brexit. Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), based in New York, New York, was acquired by Berkshire on October 19, 2022. Alleghany’s operating subsidiaries include property and casualty reinsurance and insurance, as well as a portfolio of non-financial businesses. Information regarding Alleghany’s primary insurance and reinsurance activities is provided in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group sections and its non-insurance businesses are included in the manufacturing and services sections. Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products, which generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit over time and that its managers will reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows. K- 3 GEICO —GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals desiring insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 4.0% over the past five years. During 2022, GEICO experienced a reduction of 1.7 million voluntary policies-in-force after flat year-over-year growth from 2020 to 2021. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2021, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2021 of approximately 60.5% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market share being the second largest at approximately 14.4%. GEICO’s management estimates its current market share is approximately 13.9%. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions affecting automobile manufacturers have impacted GEICO’s business and underwriting results in 2020 and thereafter. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects those and other service marks through appropriate registrations. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group —The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the U.S. These various operations are discussed below. National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial automobile and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner’s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess and surplus policies on an admitted and non-admitted basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices in several U.S. cities. BH Specialty also maintains international offices and branches located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents. Alleghany’s property and casualty insurance business is conducted in the U.S. on both an admitted and non-admitted basis through RSUI Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“RSUI”) and CapSpecialty, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“CapSpecialty”). RSUI and CapSpecialty primarily write specialty insurance in the property, umbrella/excess liability, professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, and general liability lines of business. Insurance is written through independent wholesale insurance brokers, retail agents and managing general agents. K- 4 MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance based on premiums written. MedPro provides customized HCL insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance solutions to international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, delivers liability insurance to other professionals, and offers specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines of insurance on an admitted basis, as well as on an excess and surplus basis. USLI markets policies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide a full suite of commercial insurance products, as well as homeowners policies to over 350,000 small to mid-sized businesses and homeowners. These offerings are made through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company and its affiliates (“BH Direct”) offer commercial insurance products (including workers’ compensation, property, auto, general and professional liability) to small business customers. BH Direct’s products are primarily sold through two internet-based distribution platforms, biBERK.com and Threeinsurance.com. BH Direct writes policies on an admitted basis and is based in Stamford, Connecticut. MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”) is a leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New York State. MLMIC distributes the majority of its policies on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group —Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 27 countries. Reinsurance business is written through NICO and several other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries (“NICO Group”), General Re Corporation, and its subsidiaries (“General Re Group”) and Alleghany’s Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”). The NICO Group and Gen Re Group underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut and the TransRe Group is based in New York, New York. The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. Property/casualty The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”) that incepted in 2015. The agreement was renewed, and extended, effective January 1, 2023, with an expiration of December 31, 2029. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries. The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America, primarily marketed on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC also conducts operations in North America through 11 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offers solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG, based in Cologne, Germany, and through subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. K- 5 The TransRe Group provides pro-rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance across various property and casualty lines of business. Contracts are written on both a treaty and facultative basis to insurance and other reinsurance companies in the U.S. and in foreign markets through subsidiaries and branches in numerous countries. Business is written primarily through brokers, and to a lesser extent on a direct basis. Life/health The General Re Group conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in 2022 were primarily in the Asia Pacific, U.S. and Western Europe. Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures. BHLN and affiliates are parties to contracts that reinsure certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar benefit risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity risks under reinsurance contracts, with the most recent contract incepting in 2014. Retroactive reinsurance NICO also occasionally writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Premiums from such contracts may be exceptionally large in amount. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. Periodic payment annuity BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront consideration and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation claims of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money is an important factor in establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. Investments of insurance businesses —Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and Berkshire’s other investment managers. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which is unusually concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (“float”). Float is an approximation of the net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is held for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $114 billion at the end of 2017 to approximately $164 billion at the end of 2022. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. The cost of float was nominal in 2022, reflecting a small underwriting loss. In 2021 and 2020, the cost of float was negative, reflecting underwriting earnings in each of those years. Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa Fe Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 36,000 employees at the end of 2022, of whom approximately 31,000 were members of a labor union. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business. K- 6 In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the U.S., BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern U.S. as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December 31, 2022, 38% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 23% from industrial products, 23% from agricultural products and 16% from coal. Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business. The DOT, OSHA, and EPA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety, health, and environmental aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some health, safety, and environmental aspects of rail operations in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. Environmental Matters BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. Consumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science based approaches, that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018. BNSF intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested. Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the U.S. is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.

In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, these utilities sell electricity and natural gas on a wholesale basis. As vertically integrated utilities, BHE’s U.S. utilities collectively own approximately 29,500 net megawatts of generation capacity in operation and under construction. The U.S. utilities’ business is subject to seasonal variations principally related to the use of electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating. Typically, regulated electric revenues are higher in the summer months, while regulated natural gas revenues are higher in the winter months. The natural gas pipelines consist of BHE GT&S, LLC (“BHE GT&S”), Northern Natural Gas Company (“Northern Natural”) and Kern River Gas Transmission Company (“Kern River”). BHE GT&S was acquired on November 1, 2020. BHE GT&S, based in Virginia, operates three interstate natural gas pipeline systems that consist of approximately 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines and operates seventeen underground natural gas storage fields in the eastern region of the U.S. BHE GT&S’s large underground natural gas storage assets and pipeline systems are part of an interconnected gas transmission network that provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. BHE GT&S is also an industry leader in liquefied natural gas solutions through its investments in and ownership of several liquefied natural gas facilities located throughout the eastern region of the U.S. Northern Natural, based in Nebraska, operates the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the U.S., as measured by pipeline miles, reaching from west Texas to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural’s pipeline system consists of approximately 14,400 miles of natural gas pipelines. Northern Natural’s extensive pipeline system, which is interconnected with many interstate and intrastate pipelines in the national grid system, has access to supplies from multiple major supply basins and provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. Northern Natural also operates three underground natural gas storage facilities and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units. Northern Natural’s pipeline system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand typically occurring during the months of November through March. Kern River, based in Utah, operates an interstate natural gas pipeline system that consists of approximately 1,400 miles and extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. K- 8 Other energy businesses include Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, which own a substantial electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England in an area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. These distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated tariffs for the use of their distribution systems and serve about 4.0 million electricity end-users. AltaLink L.P. (“AltaLink”) is a regulated electric transmission-only utility company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. AltaLink’s high voltage transmission lines and related facilities transmit electricity from generating facilities to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory. AltaLink serves approximately 85% of Alberta’s population. BHE and its subsidiaries, also own interests in independent power projects having approximately 6,000 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, Montana, Australia, New York, Arizona, Canada, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Hawaii. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, $7.3 billion has been invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Regulatory Matters The U.S. utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.5 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. With certain limited exceptions, the U.S. utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of U.S. utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services. Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023 and the next price control period is set for the five-year period ending March 31, 2028. AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas export/import facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. K- 9 Environmental Matters BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and reaching a global peak of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will be more aggressive in reducing GHG emissions. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement formally became effective on November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG emissions by 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Affordable Clean Energy rule in its entirety. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case were held in February 2022 and on June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision regarding the scope of the EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the “generation shifting” approach in the Clean Power Plan exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress, although the court did not address whether the EPA may only adopt measures applied at the individual source as it did in the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The Biden administration plans to propose a replacement to the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule by April 2023. In November 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to further strengthen emission requirements and intends to finalize the rules by fall 2023. BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate its GHG emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation, BHE works with its regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability and sources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar and geothermal generation, with cumulative investments of $31.6 billion through 2022 and has retired 16 coal generation units. As a result, as of December 31, 2022, BHE reduced its annual GHG emissions by more than 27% as compared to 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation in the future and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2023 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.

This business is highly competitive and subject to general real estate market conditions. Manufacturing Businesses Berkshire’s numerous and diverse manufacturing subsidiaries are grouped into three categories: (1) industrial products, (2) building products and (3) consumer products. Berkshire’s industrial products businesses manufacture components for aerospace and power generation applications, specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, and a variety of other products primarily for industrial use. The building products group produces prefabricated and site-built residential homes, flooring products, insulation, roofing and engineered products, building and engineered components, paint and coatings and bricks and masonry products. The consumer products group manufactures and distributes recreational vehicles, batteries, and various apparel, footwear and other products. Information concerning the major activities of these three groups follows. Berkshire’s manufacturing businesses employed approximately 191,000 people at the end of 2022. Industrial products Precision Castparts Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), based in Lake Oswego, Oregon, manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also manufactures investment castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications. Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, industrial gas turbine and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines. PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys, as well as titanium alloys and products. PCC’s nickel-based alloys are used to produce forged components and investment castings for aerospace and non-aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. PCC’s titanium products are used to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy, medical, and industrial end markets. PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliances and recreation markets. K- 11 PCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) (Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). The majority of PCC’s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020 and 2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking at extraordinary rates. Further, production delays in Boeing’s 737 MAX and 787 programs during this time also adversely impacted PCC over the past three years. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets during 2022, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Further recovery could be uneven, in the event of new COVID-19 variant developments and related travel restrictions, as well as from the changes in supply chain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by OEMs of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, which resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide its customers advantages, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Nevertheless, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation. PCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Laws and regulations continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will become more stringent in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change, including reporting of GHG emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters.

Lubrizol markets its products worldwide through direct sales, sales agents and distributors. Lubrizol’s customers principally consist of major global and regional oil companies and industrial and consumer products companies. Some of Lubrizol’s largest customers also may be suppliers. During 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Lubrizol’s consolidated revenues. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, severe weather and fires at certain Lubrizol facilities affected the availability of raw materials and fulfillment of customer orders and otherwise disrupted Lubrizol’s operations. Lubrizol expends significant capital to ensure the safety of its employees and the communities where it operates, as well as delivering on its commitments to operational excellence and cybersecurity. Lubrizol also makes significant capital investments to ensure reliable supply and compliance with regulations governing its operations, while reducing their environmental footprint. Lubrizol is subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws to protect the environment, limit manufacturing waste and emissions, ensure product and employee safety and regulate trade. While the company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are designed to limit the associated risks and consequent financial liability, the operation of chemical manufacturing plants entails inherent environmental, safety and other risks, and significant capital expenditures, costs or liabilities could be incurred in the future.

UTLX, while subject to cyclicality and significant competition in most of its markets, competes by offering a broad range of high-quality products and services targeted at its niche markets. Railcars are typically leased for multiple-year terms and most of the leases are renewed upon expiration. Due to selective ongoing capital investment, utilization rates (the number of railcars on lease as a percentage of the total fleet) of the railcar fleet are generally high. Intermodal tank containers are leased through EXSIF Worldwide. EXSIF is a leading international lessor of intermodal tank containers with a fleet of approximately 74,000 units, primarily serving chemical producers and logistics operators.

CTB competes with a variety of manufacturers and suppliers, including many that offer only a limited number of the products offered by CTB, as well as a few that offer products across several of CTB’s product lines. Competition is based on the price, value, reputation, quality and design of the products offered and the customer service provided by distributors, dealers and manufacturers of the products. CTB’s leading brand names, distribution network, diversified product line, product support and high-quality products enable it to compete effectively. CTB manufactures its products primarily from galvanized steel, steel wire, stainless steel and polymer materials. The availability of these materials in recent years has been adequate.

(“Clayton”), headquartered near Knoxville, Tennessee, is a vertically integrated housing company offering traditional site-built homes and off-site (factory) built housing, including modular, manufactured, CrossMod and tiny homes.

Clayton also offers home financing and insurance products and competes on price, service, location and delivery capabilities. All Clayton Built® off-site built homes are designed, engineered and assembled in the U.S. As of December 2022, off-site backlog was $256 million, down 82% from the prior year end. Clayton sells off-site built homes through independent and company-owned home centers, realtors and subdivision channels. Clayton considers its ability to offer financing to retail purchasers a factor affecting the marketplace acceptance of its off-site built homes. Clayton’s financing programs utilize proprietary loan underwriting guidelines to evaluate loan applicants. Since 2015, Clayton’s site-built division, Clayton Properties Group, has expanded through the acquisition of nine builders across 18 states with over 310 subdivisions, supplementing the portfolio of housing products offered to customers. Clayton’s site-builders currently own and control approximately 70,000 homesites, with a home order backlog of approximately $1.4 billion as of December 2022. K- 15 Historically, access to key housing inputs such as lumber, steel and resin products has been adequate. During 2021 and the first half of 2022, the availability and pricing of these and other inputs was volatile. Input shortages coupled with reduced labor and subcontractor availability increased the time needed to construct a home, increasing the levels of work-in-process inventory. These constraints began to lessen in the latter half of 2022 due to improved availability and pricing of key inputs, increased order cancellations and lower overall demand for new home construction. Clayton’s building products business has benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing demand for new home construction. Clayton’s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting and stormwater protection for site-built home subdivisions. The financing business originates and services loans which are federally regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, various state regulatory agencies and reviewed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Government National Mortgage Association and government-sponsored enterprises. Shaw Shaw Industries Group, Inc. (“Shaw”), headquartered in Dalton, Georgia, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of carpet, carpet tile, and hard surface flooring products.

Shaw’s seven carpet and nine hard surface facilities, one sample full-service distribution facility, three sample satellite locations and 30 redistribution centers, along with centralized management information systems, enable it to provide prompt and efficient delivery of its products to both its retail customers and wholesale distributors. Substantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester, as well as recycled materials. During 2022, Shaw processed approximately 89% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate, but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas price changes. A significant portion of Shaw’s soft-flooring raw materials derive from recycled sources. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers. The soft floor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of major competitors domestically. There are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in the hard surfaces flooring sector. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 41% of the total U.S. consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality, style, price and service.

JM uses recycled material when available and suitable to satisfy the broader needs of its customers. The raw materials used in these various products are generally readily available in sufficient quantities from various sources to maintain and expand its current production levels. JM’s operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which regulate or impose liability for the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances and use of chemical substances. The most relevant of the federal laws are the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which are administered by the EPA.

JM operates in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprising primarily large global and national manufacturers and smaller regional manufacturers. JM holds leadership positions in the key markets that it serves. JM’s products compete primarily on value, differentiation and customization, breadth of product line, quality and service. Sales of JM’s products are moderately seasonal due to increases in construction activity that typically occur in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. MiTek MiTek Industries, Inc.

Benjamin Moore also allows customers to directly order coatings or color samples online or, for national accounts and government agencies, via its customer information center, for delivery to the customer or a retailer near the customer. K- 17 Benjamin Moore competes with numerous manufacturers, distributors and paint, coatings and related products retailers.

Competitors include other premium paint and decorating stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets, such as Sherwin-Williams Company, PPG Industries, Inc., The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. The most significant raw materials in Benjamin Moore products are titanium dioxide, monomers, polymers and pigments. Historically, these materials have been generally available, with pricing and availability subject to fluctuation. However, Benjamin Moore experienced raw material constraints concurrent with the COVID-19 pandemic. These constraints began to ease in the second half of 2022, allowing for the return to normal production scheduling, replenishment of overall finished goods inventory levels and the reduction of customer order cancellations. Some limited constraints remain with alkyd raw materials resulting in elevated cancellation quantities for orders with those products. Benjamin Moore continually evaluates processes, including evaluating raw material substitutions and sourcing from alternative vendors, to optimize production capacity to meet future demand. Benjamin Moore undertakes to comply with applicable regulations relating to protection of the environment and workers’ safety and Benjamin Moore products meet or exceed environmental standards.

(“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S., currently operating 106 new vehicle franchises through 83 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the U.S. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law. BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

K- 23 Pilot Travel Centers Since October 2017, we have owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“Pilot”), headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Through December 31, 2022, we accounted for our investment in Pilot under the equity method. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot and we attained control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes as of that date. Consequently, we will discontinue the use of the equity method and include Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Pilot sold over 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022 (primarily diesel and gasoline). Pilot has approximately 25,500 employees. Pilot’s travel centers are generally located close to an interstate highway and offer petroleum products, merchandise, fast food, and a variety of services and amenities to consumers and professional truck drivers. While Pilot’s primary business is operating fuel and inside store travel centers, it also enters into dealer agreements with existing travel centers where Pilot procures and sells diesel fuel at these locations for a fee. Additionally, Pilot operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. and operates a water hauling and disposal business in the oil fields sector. The travel center industry is concentrated among a few large operators (including Love’s Travel Stops and TravelCenters of America), although there are numerous independent operators that operate one to ten travel centers. Pilot’s top 10 customers for diesel sales account for less than 15% of total diesel gallons sold by Pilot, while Pilot’s top 10 fuel suppliers account for less than 50% of gallons purchased by Pilot. Pilot currently supplies approximately 1.5 billion gallons per year of low-carbon fuels (renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol) and approximately 320 million gallons per year of diesel exhaust fluid. During 2022, Pilot entered a partnership with General Motors Company to develop a nationwide electric vehicle fast charger network of 2,000 charging stations in 500 U.S. locations by 2026. Pilot also signed a letter of intent with Volvo during 2022 in a partnership to develop a nationwide public charging network to support the expansion of battery-powered electric trucks. Pilot is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for non-compliance. Certain assets (such as petroleum tanks, dispensers, and disposal wells) impose retirement obligations.

Ris k Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. General Business Risks Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses. A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical terrorist attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. Cyber security risks We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 92, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 99. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett. Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel to execute business plans and serve their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit, train and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. K- 25 Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value. We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of issuers. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings. Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits. Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions, including significant inflation over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks could hurt our operating businesses. The outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks in the future may adversely affect our operations, including the value of our equity securities portfolio. This may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed, for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, the regulation of products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. Climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions may impact our businesses. The impacts of climate change and the regulation of GHG emissions could impact our businesses to varying degrees. Climate change could cause or intensify hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that may increase physical risks to and impacts on our operations. An increase in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events and storms could impact the physical assets of our non-insurance operations and could produce losses affecting our businesses. Similarly, extreme weather events may produce losses affecting our insurance operations as their primary business is to monitor, assess and price risk, including climate-related risk, at an expected economic profit to address the risk-transfer needs of their insurance customers. Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge that accelerate the transition to a lower GHG emitting economy and could, in turn, increase costs for our businesses to comply with those policies, including BNSF and BHE, which combined represent more than 90% of Berkshire’s direct emissions. The failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretation of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. K- 26 Risks unique to our regulated businesses Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate in excess of $15 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Various provisions of our policies, negotiated to limit our risk, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend, as it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period. The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. It is possible that significant claims may emerge or develop in the future from the policies we have written in the past. As industry practices and legal, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($143 billion at December 31, 2022), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. K- 27 Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. System assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses. Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503 (a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Securi ty Holder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbols: BRK.A and BRK.B, respectively. Shareholders Berkshire had approximately 1,300 record holders of its Class A common stock and 18,700 record holders of its Class B common stock at February 13, 2023. Record owners included nominees holding at least 334,000 shares of Class A common stock and 1,297,000,000 shares of Class B common stock on behalf of beneficial-but-not-of-record owners. Dividends Berkshire has not declared a cash dividend since 1967. K- 31 Common Stock Repurchase Program Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2022 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program October Class A common stock 1,550 $ 426,592.77 1,550 * Class B common stock — $ — — * November Class A common stock 2,146 $ 463,584.86 2,146 * Class B common stock — $ — — * December Class A common stock 584 $ 468,113.93 584 * Class B common stock 3,046,794 $ 303.83 3,046,794 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion. Stock Performance Graph The following chart compares the subsequent value of $100 invested in Berkshire common stock on December 31, 2017 with a similar investment in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index and in the Standard & Poor’s Property – Casualty Insurance Index**. * Cumulative return for the Standard & Poor’s indices based on reinvestment of dividends. ** It would be difficult to develop a peer group of companies similar to Berkshire. The Corporation owns subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities of which an important component is the property and casualty insurance business. Accordingly, management has used the Standard & Poor’s Property—Casualty Insurance Index for comparative purposes. Item 6. [Reserved] K- 32 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Insurance – underwriting $ (90 ) $ 728 $ 657 Insurance – investment income 6,484 4,807 5,039 Railroad 5,946 5,990 5,161 Utilities and energy 3,904 3,572 3,141 Manufacturing, service and retailing 12,512 11,120 8,300 Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) (53,612 ) 62,340 31,591 Other* 2,037 1,238 (11,368 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (22,819 ) $ 89,795 $ 42,521 * Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic affected our operating businesses in varying ways and degrees, particularly in 2020 and 2021. Significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, developed in 2022 and are continuing in 2023. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting generated an after-tax loss of $90 million in 2022 and after-tax earnings of $728 million in 2021 and $657 million in 2020. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2021 and $750 million in 2020. Underwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims frequencies and severities at GEICO, and favorably impacted by higher earnings from reinsurance underwriting and foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities and by the reduction in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, as well as from high claims costs in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, significantly reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance coverages. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by low interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. K- 33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad, BNSF were relatively unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 16.1% in 2021 versus 2020. Results in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, substantially offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected relatively low railroad operating revenues from reduced shipping volumes, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 9.3% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 13.7% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected higher earnings from other energy businesses, including tax equity investments and the Northern Powergrid businesses, as well as from the natural gas pipeline businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business. The increase in 2021 reflected higher earnings from the U.S. utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 12.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 34.0% in 2021 versus 2020. Operating results in 2022 were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the second half of the year at certain of our businesses. We experienced the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs through much of 2022. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to relatively strong customer demand for products and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021 and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Other earnings also included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2022 included Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida, floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K- 34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. These businesses were included in the BH Primary and BHRG underwriting results beginning as of that date. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less losses incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ (1,880 ) $ 1,259 $ 3,428 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 393 607 110 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 1,389 (930 ) (2,700 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings (98 ) 936 838 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (8 ) 208 181 Net underwriting earnings (loss) $ (90 ) $ 728 $ 657 Effective income tax rate 8.5 % 22.2 % 21.5 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 39,107 $ 38,395 $ 34,928 Premiums earned $ 38,984 100.0 $ 37,706 100.0 $ 35,093 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 36,297 93.1 30,999 82.2 26,018 74.1 Underwriting expenses 4,567 11.7 5,448 14.5 5,647 16.1 Total losses and expenses 40,864 104.8 36,447 96.7 31,665 90.2 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (1,880 ) $ 1,259 $ 3,428 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting results in each of the past three years were significantly affected by changes in average claims frequencies and severities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided a 15% premium reduction to all new or renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected significant increases in average claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and have continued through 2022. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to elevated claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continued to trend higher in 2022. K- 35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) 2022 versus 2021 Premiums written increased $712 million (1.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, which were substantially offset by a decrease in policies-in-force. Voluntary auto policies-in-force declined 8.9% in 2022 compared to 2021 while average premiums per voluntary auto policy increased 11.3%. Premiums earned increased $1.3 billion (3.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021, partially attributable to a reduction in 2021 of approximately $475 million from the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.3 billion (17.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 93.1% in 2022, an increase of 10.9 percentage points over 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and severities, as well as lower reductions of ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ events. Claims frequencies in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent range), bodily injury and collision (four to five percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). Average claims severities in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range), collision (fourteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $653 million in 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases in all major coverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $400 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $375 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021. Underwriting expenses decreased $881 million (16.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant reductions in advertising costs and lower employee-related costs. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 11.7% in 2022, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points compared to 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums. GEICO has successfully obtained premium rate increase approvals from certain states in response to the significant claims costs increases it has experienced in recent years. As a result, we currently expect GEICO to generate an underwriting profit in 2023. 2021 versus 2020 Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s loss ratio increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years. Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 were $81 million from significant catastrophe events. Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower expenses and higher premiums earned. K- 36 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group consists of several independently managed businesses that provide a variety of primarily commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). This group also includes Alleghany’s RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“Alleghany Insurance”) beginning October 19, 2022. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 14,619 $ 12,595 $ 10,212 Premiums earned $ 13,746 100.0 $ 11,575 100.0 $ 9,615 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,889 71.9 8,107 70.0 7,129 74.1 Underwriting expenses 3,464 25.2 2,861 24.8 2,376 24.7 Total losses and expenses 13,353 97.1 10,968 94.8 9,505 98.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 393 $ 607 $ 110 Premiums written increased $2.0 billion (16.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases at BH Specialty (16%), USLI (16%), BHHC (15%) and MedPro Group (10%), and from the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($435 million). Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases from BH Specialty (36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%) and USLI (20%). The increases in each year were across a variety of coverages and in several markets. BH Primary’s loss ratio increased 1.9 percentage points compared to 2021, which decreased 4.1 percentage points versus 2020. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events were $641 million in 2022 ($554 from Hurricane Ian), $433 million in 2021 ($239 million from Hurricane Ida) and $207 million in 2020 ($160 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally). Incurred losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities attributable to the pandemic of $167 million. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $428 million in 2022, $631 million in 2021 and $265 million in 2020. BH Primary insurers continue to write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors. Underwriting expenses increased $603 million (21.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, while underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases reflected the increases in premiums earned and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, Alleghany’s Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”). We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO and we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN.

Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business, increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily attributable to property coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $727 million (7.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were $2.0 billion in 2022 ($1.6 billion from Hurricane Ian), $2.1 billion ($933 million from Hurricane Ida) in 2021 and $667 million in 2020 ($357 million in the aggregate from Hurricanes Laura and Sally). Losses incurred in 2020 also included $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events of $1.6 billion in 2022 and $718 million in 2021 and increases of $162 million in 2020. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 2.9 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $371 million in 2022 compared to $173 million in 2021, related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. K- 38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 5,185 $ 5,621 $ 5,848 Premiums earned $ 5,279 100.0 $ 5,648 100.0 $ 5,861 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 4,004 75.8 4,933 87.3 4,883 83.3 Underwriting expenses 983 18.7 1,136 20.2 996 17.0 Total benefits and expenses 4,987 94.5 6,069 107.5 5,879 100.3 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 292 $ (421 ) $ (18 ) Life/health premiums written decreased $436 million (7.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021 which decreased 3.9% from 2020. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects ($289 million) and decreased volume in the Asia Pacific region. Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits declined $929 million (18.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to relatively high pandemic-related mortality claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in assumptions used in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business in run-off. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results primarily derive from the runoff of contracts written several years ago. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency gains were $168 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2021 versus pre-tax losses of $171 million in 2020. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $836 million in 2022, $840 million in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily from deferred charge amortization. Underwriting results also reflected the effects of changes in the estimates of the timing of future payments and amounts of ultimate claim liabilities. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts were increased $86 million in 2022 and reduced $974 million in 2021, which net of related changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced relatively insignificant effects on underwriting earnings. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $35.4 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $2.4 billion since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to paid claims. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $769 million since December 31, 2021. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned decreased $76 million (11.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, which increased $92 million (16.3%) compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. K- 39 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accruals on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $164 million in 2022 and $18 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $67 million in 2020. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $696 million in 2022, $526 million in 2021 and $550 million in 2020. Pre-tax losses in 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to the termination of a reinsurance contract, in which the settlement paid exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted liabilities were $15.4 billion at December 31, 2022, which included $3.9 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-12 in 2023, the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities will be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates which could have a significant effect on our recorded liabilities. The periodic effect from discount rate changes will be reflected in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $117 million in 2022 and $114 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate increases and changes in securities markets. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Dividend income $ 6,039 $ 5,060 $ 4,890 19.3 % 3.5 % Interest and other investment income 1,685 589 1,059 186.1 (44.4 ) Pre-tax net investment income 7,724 5,649 5,949 36.7 (5.0 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,240 842 910 Net investment income $ 6,484 $ 4,807 $ 5,039 Effective income tax rate 16.0 % 14.9 % 15.3 % Dividend income increased $979 million (19.3%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased $170 million (3.5%) in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $46 million in 2022, $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased $1.1 billion (186.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in interest income due to interest rate increases during the year, as well as the inclusion of interest income on assets of Alleghany’s insurance subsidiaries. Interest and other investment income in 2021 declined 44.4% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. K- 40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $164 billion at December 31, 2022, $147 billion at December 31, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Float at December 31, 2022 included approximately $14 billion attributable to Alleghany’s insurance and reinsurance businesses. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $98 million in 2022, and the cost of float was nominal. In 2021 and 2020, our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains, and consequently, the cost of float in each year was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions). December 31, 2022 2021 Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills $ 86,816 $ 90,688 Equity securities 298,934 334,907 Fixed maturity securities 24,998 16,386 Other 3,417 4,296 $ 414,165 $ 446,277 Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions).

K- 41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Railroad operating revenues $ 25,203 $ 22,513 $ 20,181 11.9 % 11.6 % Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 5,253 4,696 4,542 11.9 3.4 Fuel 4,581 2,766 1,789 65.6 54.6 Purchased services 2,102 2,033 1,954 3.4 4.0 Depreciation and amortization 2,517 2,444 2,460 3.0 (0.7 ) Equipment rents, materials and other 2,147 1,763 1,684 21.8 4.7 Total 16,600 13,702 12,429 21.2 10.2 Railroad operating earnings 8,603 8,811 7,752 (2.4 ) 13.7 Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 685 769 688 (10.9 ) 11.8 Other expenses, net (555 ) (687 ) (611 ) (19.2 ) 12.4 Interest expense (1,025 ) (1,032 ) (1,037 ) (0.7 ) (0.5 ) Pre-tax earnings 7,708 7,861 6,792 (1.9 ) 15.7 Income taxes 1,762 1,871 1,631 (5.8 ) 14.7 Net earnings $ 5,946 $ 5,990 $ 5,161 (0.7 ) 16.1 Effective income tax rate 22.9 % 23.8 % 24.0 % The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Consumer products 5,202 5,673 5,266 (8.3 )% 7.7 % Industrial products 1,618 1,709 1,622 (5.3 ) 5.4 Agricultural products 1,200 1,224 1,189 (2.0 ) 2.9 Coal 1,529 1,529 1,404 — 8.9 9,549 10,135 9,481 (5.8 ) 6.9 2022 versus 2021 Railroad operating revenues increased 11.9% in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting an 18.9% increase in average revenue per car/unit, including the impact from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes of 5.8%. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.9% in 2022 from 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 were impacted by lower volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs, offset by higher yield and fuel surcharge revenue. Operating revenues from consumer products increased 11.8% in 2022 to $9.2 billion compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 8.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments, resulting from supply chain disruptions and lower west coast imports during the second half of the year. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 5.6% from 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 5.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in petroleum products related to lower demand for shipments of crude by rail and lower building products, steel and taconite shipments, partially offset by increased mineral shipments. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 12.6% to $5.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit partially offset by lower volumes of 2.0%. The decrease in volumes was primarily due to lower grain exports and fertilizer shipments, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.7% to $3.9 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Coal volumes were unchanged compared to 2021. K- 42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Continued) Railroad operating expenses were $16.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.9 billion (21.2%) compared to 2021. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 65.9% in 2022 versus 2021. The operating expense increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $557 million (11.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from the ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $1.8 billion (65.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $384 million (21.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, due to general inflation, lower gains from land and easement sales and higher casualty and litigation costs. Approximately 31,000 of BNSF’s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were engaged in multi-party national negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. Federal mediation was included in that timeframe, followed by a release from the National Mediation Board and subsequent appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. The PEB issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these recommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. Thereafter, a majority of the unions ratified those agreements with the remainder being imposed by Congress in December 2022. This concluded the national round which is not subject to re-opening until late 2024. 2021 versus 2020 Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by disruptions in the global supply chain. Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs. K- 43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S”). Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 21,069 $ 18,935 $ 15,556 Real estate operating revenue 5,268 6,215 5,396 Other income (loss) 56 (54 ) 148 Total revenue 26,393 25,096 21,100 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 6,757 5,504 4,187 Energy operating expense 9,233 8,535 7,539 Real estate operating costs and expense 5,117 5,710 4,885 Interest expense 2,140 2,054 1,941 Total costs and expense 23,247 21,803 18,552 Pre-tax earnings 3,146 3,293 2,548 Income tax expense (benefit)* (1,629 ) (1,153 ) (996 ) Net earnings after income taxes 4,775 4,446 3,544 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 423 399 71 Net earnings attributable to BHE 4,352 4,047 3,473 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 448 475 332 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 3,904 $ 3,572 $ 3,141 Effective income tax rate (51.8 )% (35.0 )% (39.1 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. K- 44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 U.S. utilities $ 2,295 $ 2,211 $ 1,969 3.8 % 12.3 % Natural gas pipelines 1,040 807 528 28.9 52.8 Other energy businesses 1,338 979 953 36.7 2.7 Real estate brokerage 100 387 375 (74.2 ) 3.2 Corporate interest and other (421 ) (337 ) (352 ) 24.9 (4.3 ) $ 4,352 $ 4,047 $ 3,473 7.5 16.5 2022 versus 2021 Our U.S. utilities operate in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings increased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and a $157 million increase in production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses and state income taxes. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC and NV Energy, increases in general and plant maintenance costs, incremental depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and higher accruals at PacifiCorp associated with the 2020 wildfires. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $586 million (8.3%) compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 2.4% (1.6% at PacifiCorp, 4.3% at MEC and 2.2% at NV Energy) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $233 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Substantially all of the increase was derived from BHE GT&S, primarily attributable to higher regulated storage and service revenues from a general rate case settlement and higher revenues and margins from non-regulated activities, as well as income tax adjustments. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $359 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $200 million and the impact in 2021 on income tax expense of $109 million at Northern Powergrid related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The earnings increase also reflected higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and earnings from new gas exploration and solar projects, partially offset by lower earnings from natural gas generating facilities and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in 2022. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected the impact of losses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms as well as increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $287 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to an 11% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 40% decrease in closed transaction volumes, attributable to lower homeowner refinancing activity resulting from rising interest rates. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower state income tax benefits and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2022. K- 45 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 The U.S. utilities’ after-tax earnings increased $242 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and an increase of $139 million in production tax credits recognized at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC, increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and by the impacts of a depreciation study effective January 1, 2021 at PacifiCorp. The operating expense increase was partially offset by the impact of accruals at PacifiCorp in 2020 associated with wildfires and changes to a settlement agreement in 2021 related to a hydroelectric facility, as well as lower costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at NV Energy. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $126 million (1.8%) compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs as well as lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020 at NV Energy. Retail customer volumes increased 3.8% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $279 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The earnings increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental earnings of $211 million from the BHE GT&S acquisition completed in November 2020. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $26 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid ($46 million), partially offset by lower earnings from renewable energy. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $74 million from increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rates in both 2021 and 2020. The decline in earnings from renewable energy reflected a reduction in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to an increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower mortgage volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020. K- 46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Beginning January 31, 2023, this group will include Pilot Travel Centers.

In 2020, net earnings also excluded after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.4 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-33 and in the “Other” earnings table on page K-56. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Revenues Industrial products $ 30,824 $ 28,176 $ 25,667 9.4 % 9.8 % Building products 28,896 24,974 21,244 15.7 17.6 Consumer products 16,061 15,580 12,168 3.1 28.0 $ 75,781 $ 68,730 $ 59,079 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 4,862 $ 4,469 $ 3,755 8.8 % 19.0 % Building products 4,789 3,390 2,858 41.3 18.6 Consumer products 1,526 1,982 1,397 (23.0 ) 41.9 $ 11,177 $ 9,841 $ 8,010 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 15.8 % 15.9 % 14.6 % Building products 16.6 % 13.6 % 13.5 % Consumer products 9.5 % 12.7 % 11.5 % K- 47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel, acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition Additionally, the Alleghany businesses included certain other smaller manufacturers that primarily became part of Marmon. 2022 versus 2021 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2022 increased $2.6 billion (9.4%) and pre-tax earnings increased $393 million (8.8%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2022 was 15.8%, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared 2021. PCC’s revenues were $7.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion (16.5%) compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. Deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part, attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program. However, Boeing resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2021. PCC’s results in 2022 were negatively affected by increased costs for labor and training, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions, as well as a $59 million reduction in pension plan income. PCC management has taken and will continue to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for its products. Growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and employment environments. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes throughout 2022 were restricted by effects of supply constraints for certain raw materials and the effects of unplanned plant maintenance activities, both of which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. We believe supply chain and required maintenance constraints are easing and that we can increase production rates and sales volumes in 2023. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 48.6% compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 included insurance recoveries of $242 million related to a fire in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and a fire in 2021 at the Rockton, Illinois, facility compared to insurance recoveries of $55 million in 2021. Earnings in 2022 also included aggregate losses related to the Rockton, Illinois fire of $36 million compared to aggregate losses and asset impairment charges in 2021 of $257 million related to the Rockton facility fire and an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher unplanned maintenance expenses, and by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by severe winter storms, which caused industry-wide temporary facilities closures, including at our Additives facilities, which experienced lost sales and incremental manufacturing and other operating costs. Marmon’s revenues were $10.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $934 million (9.6%) compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Retail Solutions, Metal Services and Crane groups, which contributed 82% of the increase. These increases generally reflected higher volumes and prices in our heavy-duty truck & trailer, shopping cart and store shelving businesses, stronger demand in Canada for metal services and higher demand in the mining and infrastructure markets. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the transit, oil & gas, utility and restaurant markets, also increased in 2022, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates and fewer third-party tank car sales. K- 48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 11.3% compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected increases in the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Crane and several other business groups due to higher volumes and pricing, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates, higher repair costs and losses of approximately $90 million related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its business in Russia. IMC’s revenues increased 4.5% to $3.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased sales in most regions, partially offset by the foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar, lower sales in China (attributable to the pandemic) and the effects the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Europe. IMC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 2.5% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower average gross sales margins, primarily attributable to changes in product sales mix and higher raw material costs. Earnings were also negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and the Russian-Ukraine conflict. 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2020. PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and OEM aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. PCC’s revenues were negatively impacted in both years by reduced aircraft production levels, which reflected order delays and cancellations by airlines and inventory reduction initiatives within the industry. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020, which reflected significant restructuring costs and inefficiencies associated with reduction in production. Asset impairment and restructuring costs in 2020 were $295 million. The 2021 earnings increase also reflected the actions taken by management in 2020 and 2021 to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines in 2021 were negatively affected by the impacts of the severe winter weather events in the first quarter, raw materials supply constraints and unplanned maintenance in the second half of the year. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. The earnings decline in 2021 included previously mentioned losses of $257 million related to the Rockton, Illinois facility fire and asset impairment charges, as well as the adverse effects of rising raw material costs and the winter storms in 2021. Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020, which was negatively impacted by the initial effects of the pandemic. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix. K- 49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 40.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins and relatively low earnings in 2020 attributable to the pandemic. Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 2022 versus 2021 Revenues of the building products group increased $3.9 billion (15.7%) in 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $1.4 billion (41.3%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 16.6% in 2022 and 13.6% in 2021. During 2021 and much of 2022, our businesses experienced relatively strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. Our building products businesses benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing demand for new home construction in the fourth quarter. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near term will likely decline from current levels. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $12.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.2 billion (21.1%) over 2021. Revenues from home sales for the year increased $2.1 billion (25.1%) in 2022 to approximately $10.4 billion, primarily due to higher average selling prices. New home unit sales increased 6.2% in 2022, reflecting a 6.0% increase in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 7.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. However, unit sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 declined 3.9% from 2021, and our net order backlog declined significantly during 2022. We expect the comparative decline in unit sales to accelerate in the near term. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.7% in 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion from December 31, 2021. Actual and anticipated loan foreclosures rose during the fourth quarter of 2022. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $685 million (40.7%) compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest income. As previously mentioned, we expect unit home sales to decline in the near term and we anticipate earnings will also decline in 2023 compared to 2022. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $16.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 11.8% versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Significant cost inflation in 2021, that continued through 2022, largely drove the higher selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 41.9% over 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 15.0% in 2022, a 3.2 percentage point increase compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as an increase in gains from certain business divestitures and asset sales and reduced impairment and restructuring charges. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the negative impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other operating costs in 2021. K- 50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions that contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected operating results. In addition, higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (“Jazwares”), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. 2022 versus 2021 Consumer products group revenues increased $481 million (3.1%) in 2022 versus 2021, reflecting an 8.0% increase from Forest River and the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, substantially offset by lower apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues (4.7% in the aggregate). In the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer products revenues before the impact of the Jazwares acquisition declined 15.7%, driven by significant declines in recreational vehicle unit sales. Revenues of Forest River increased 8.0% in 2022 compared to 2021, while apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues decreased 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The declines in apparel and footwear revenues were driven by lower volumes, as major retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell’s revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. K- 51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) Consumer products group pre-tax earnings declined $456 million (23.0%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and as a percentage of revenues in 2022 decreased 3.2 percentage points to 9.5%. The earnings decline reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses (68.0%) and Duracell (30.6%), partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River (7.6%). Our apparel businesses were negatively affected in 2022 by low sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. The reductions in sales volumes and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 have also elevated our current inventories. We currently believe retailers will continue to constrain purchases in the near term and that our sales volumes and earnings will continue to be negatively affected. We are taking measures to right-size our operations for the long-term and reduce product inventories to more appropriate levels. Duracell’s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects. Earnings from Forest River increased in 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs. However, sales volumes, revenues and earnings declined over the second half of the year compared to the elevated levels in the first half of 2022 and in 2021. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River’s comparative revenues and earnings to decline in 2023, particularly over the first half of the year. 2021 versus 2020 Consumer products group revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs. Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%. Consumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our businesses. However, our consumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 Revenues Service $ 19,006 $ 15,872 $ 12,346 19.7 % 28.6 % Retailing 19,297 18,960 15,832 1.8 19.8 McLane 53,209 49,450 46,840 7.6 5.6 $ 91,512 $ 84,282 $ 75,018 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 3,047 $ 2,672 $ 1,600 14.0 % 67.0 % Retailing 1,724 1,809 1,028 (4.7 ) 76.0 McLane 271 230 251 17.8 (8.4 ) $ 5,042 $ 4,711 $ 2,879 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.0 % 16.8 % 13.0 % Retailing 8.9 % 9.5 % 6.5 % McLane 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.5 % K- 52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning, October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management. 2022 versus 2021 Service group revenues increased $3.1 billion (19.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to revenue increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses, as well as the impact of the IPS acquisition. Revenues from TTI increased 17.4% in 2022 versus 2021. However, in the third quarter, new orders began to slow in certain regions and markets and the slowing of new orders was observed across nearly all regions in the fourth quarter. The slowing of electronic components demand is in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (11%), customer flight hours (9%), most of which occurred in the first half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer flight hours and significant increases in fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $375 million (14.0%) in 2022 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% in 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. The earnings increase in 2022 was attributable to TTI (19.4%) and aviation services (3.4%), as well as increased earnings from several of our smaller services businesses. The increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and higher average gross margin rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. The earnings increase from aviation services in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to improved product sales margins, increased training hours and lower restructuring costs at FlightSafety. Earnings at our smaller services companies increased $106 million (19.3%) over 2021, reflecting a combination of higher revenues and operating cost leverage. 2021 versus 2020 Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%). Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage, changes in sales mix and a gain from a legal settlement. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), which represented 65% of our combined retailing revenue in 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in 2022. K- 53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 2022 versus 2021 Retailing group revenues in 2022 increased $337 million (1.8%) compared to 2021, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in 2022 increased 6.1% compared to 2021. Revenues from new and used retail vehicle sales increased 5.9% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by a 4.5% decline in total retail units sold. New vehicle unit sales continue to be constrained by relatively low new vehicle production, although production gradually trended higher during 2022. Revenues from BHA’s service and repair business increased 11.1% versus 2021. Revenues of the home furnishings group declined 2.6%, while revenues of all other retailers declined 8.9%, primarily due to lower sales at Pampered Chef. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 of the retailing group decreased $85 million (4.7%) from 2021 and the pre-tax margin rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 18.4%, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates began to accelerate during the second half of 2021, attributable to low available inventory. BHA’s vehicle gross margin rates peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $233 million (23.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to reduced earnings from the home furnishings group, See’s Candies and Pampered Chef. 2021 versus 2020 Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0%, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales increased $1.7 billion (20.7%), primarily due to higher average selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at manufacturers attributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0%, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) in 2021 from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5%, primarily due to increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating cost control efforts. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020. K- 54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) McLane McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 62% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2022 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 2022 versus 2021 Revenues of $53.2 billion in 2022 increased $3.8 billion (7.6%) compared to 2021. Revenues from the grocery business increased 4.4%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 14.1% and 6.0%, respectively. Pre-tax earnings increased $41 million (17.8%) in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflected slightly higher gross margin rates in the grocery and foodservice businesses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, high fuel costs and high inventory costs. 2021 versus 2020 Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we experienced, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel costs was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Investment gains (losses) $ (67,623 ) $ 77,576 $ 40,905 Derivative contract gains (losses) (276 ) 966 (159 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (67,899 ) 78,542 40,746 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (14,287 ) 16,202 9,155 Net earnings (loss) $ (53,612 ) $ 62,340 $ 31,591 Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 20.4 % 21.7 % K- 55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) (Continued) Investment gains (losses) Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized losses of approximately $63.1 billion in 2022 and gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021 and $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including losses of $3.9 billion in 2022, gains of $1.0 billion in 2021 and losses of $14.0 billion in 2020. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $769 million in 2022, $3.6 billion in 2021 and $6.2 billion in 2020. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains (losses) Derivative contract gains and losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. Substantially all of our contracts have expired and our exposure to loss in the future is insignificant. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings follows (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Equity method earnings $ 1,528 $ 804 $ 615 Acquisition accounting expenses (681 ) (690 ) (783 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments — — (10,381 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (269 ) (305 ) (334 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 1,263 955 (764 ) Other earnings 196 474 279 $ 2,037 $ 1,238 $ (11,368 ) After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Occidental Petroleum and Berkadia. Equity method earnings increased $724 million in 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot and from the inclusion of Occidental Petroleum, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $550 million in 2022, $317 million in 2021 and $170 million in 2020, which included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $611 million in 2020. Our after-tax earnings from Occidental in 2022 were $258 million and our after-tax earnings from Pilot increased $267 million in 2022 compared to 2021. As a result of the increase in our ownership in Pilot to 80% on January 31, 2023, we discontinued the use of the equity method on that date. See Note 26 to the Consolidated financial Statements. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional details. K- 56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other (Continued) Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to the Berkshire and BHFC Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and other unallocated income and income taxes. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 was $472.4 billion, a decrease of $33.8 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $22.8 billion and included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $53.4 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $7.9 billion during 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and Class B common stock. At December 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $125.0 billion, which included $94.7 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $333.9 billion. During 2022, we paid cash of $67.9 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $33.7 billion from sales of equity securities. On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for $11.5 billion, which held cash and investments of $19.7 billion as of the acquisition date. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion, which was based on Pilot’s unaudited earnings in 2022 and its net debt as of December 31, 2022 and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of the audit of Pilot’s 2022 consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $122.7 billion, of which approximately 94% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. During 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $12.7 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.9 billion of maturing senior debt. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $17.4 in 2023; $10.4 in 2024; $11.0 in 2025; $8.7 in 2026; and $8.1 in 2027. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $21.4 billion, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2021. In 2022, Berkshire issued an aggregate ¥243.5 billion (approximately $1.94 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.8%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $1.4 billion during 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $25.1 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion since December 31, 2021. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.8 billion since December 31, 2021, reflecting the issuance of debt, repayments of maturing debt ($775 million) and reductions in the carrying value of non-U.S. denominated debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes ($300 million). In 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes maturing in 2027, 2032 and 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and €1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. Subsidiary borrowings as of December 31, 2022 included approximately $2.3 billion attributable to Alleghany and its subsidiaries. K- 57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $233 million from December 31, 2021. In 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053 and repaid approximately $900 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.8 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion since December 31, 2021. In 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053. During 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $3.0 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2053. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows between $37 billion and $40 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $15.5 billion in 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $11.0 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $13.7 billion in 2023. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.8 in 2023; $1.6 in 2024; $1.4 in 2025; $1.3 in 2026; and $1.5 in 2027. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $143 billion at December 31, 2022. We currently forecast claim payments in 2023 of approximately $35 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2023. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $2 billion in 2023 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $24 billion, including $12 billion in 2023. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2022 follows. K- 58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $143 billion, of which 78% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance. As of December 31, 2022, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $24.8 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $23.8 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2022, case development liabilities averaged approximately 38% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. IBNR claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2021 were reduced by $653 million during 2022, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2022 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2022. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $245 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. K- 59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2022 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 8,314 $ 12,136 $ 20,450 IBNR liabilities 9,084 21,041 30,125 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 17,398 33,177 50,575 Reinsurance recoverable 787 1,439 2,226 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 16,611 $ 31,738 $ 48,349 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. In the U.S., client reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2022, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $650 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. K- 60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: Paid and incurred loss development methods – These methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – These methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – These methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2022, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $114 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. For other casualty losses, other than asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $650 million in 2022. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $980 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $980 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2022. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. K- 61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. At December 31, 2022, gross unpaid losses were $35.4 billion and deferred charges were $9.9 billion. Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $52 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $86 million in 2022. In 2022, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.4 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that amortization expense in 2023 will approximate $860 million. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $78.1 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K- 62 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) As of December 31, 2022, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting units businesses, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production and the actions we were taking to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent the most significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five companies. We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. K- 63 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) For the past several years, we were also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. However, substantially all of the contracts written to date have expired. The following table summarizes our significant assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value After Hypothetical Change in Prices Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Earnings (1) December 31, 2022 Investments in equity securities $ 308,793 30% increase $ 399,087 $ 71,344 30% decrease 218,688 (71,195 ) December 31, 2021 Investments in equity securities $ 350,719 30% increase $ 452,936 $ 81,136 30% decrease 248,606 (81,053 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 99 30% increase 5 74 30% decrease 1,088 (781 ) Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. K- 64 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way. K- 65 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Foreign Currency Risk (Continued) Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in net earnings related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities of Berkshire and its U.S.-based subsidiaries. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions). 2022 2021 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ 1,263 $ 955 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings 263 58 Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income (2,045 ) (1,021 ) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We generally do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qu alitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February 25, 2023 K- 66 Item 8. Financial Statement s and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Omaha, Nebraska Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. K- 67 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) under short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are $107,472 million as of December 31, 2022. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment emergence patterns, and expected loss reporting emergence patterns. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2022, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others: Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 17 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance contracts are $35,415 million as of December 31, 2022. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment emergence patterns, and expected loss reporting emergence. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2022, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following, among others: K- 68 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $8 billion of goodwill and approximately $13 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

(“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 25. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain immaterial balances in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified in prior years to conform to current year presentations. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. To varying degrees the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. Such actions in 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world. In addition, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. The development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. In the U.S. and elsewhere, governments are implementing actions intended to slow price inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills have maturities exceeding three months and less than one year at the time of purchase. We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of our investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. K- 75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses. We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock, and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-substance common stock as defined by GAAP. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. K- 76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. We measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. We carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances are net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2022, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 30 % of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $ 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. K- 77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) We use property, plant and equipment in our operations. We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions to property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years , interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years . We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years . We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess up to the balance of goodwill is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K- 78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally earned in proportion to the coverage provided, which in most cases is ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are received in full at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K- 79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize deferred policy acquisition costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized over the expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy. Such anticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits. The recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs generally considers anticipated investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included $ 3.2 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively, related to property and casualty insurance contracts. K- 80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Liabilities for future life, annuity and health insurance benefits represent the present value of expected future benefits and non-acquisition variable expenses, less the present value of expected future net premiums (the portion of gross premium required to provide for all expected future benefits and variable expenses). In estimating future cash flows, we consider the timing and amounts of future claims, premiums and expenses, which require estimates concerning future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used for discounting may vary by contract or underlying currency denomination of our reinsurance contracts. Generally, assumptions regarding cash flow and discount rate are fixed at the inception of the contract and changed only under certain adverse circumstances. The effects of changes in estimated cash flows and discount rate assumptions on benefit liabilities are recorded in earnings in the period of the change. Periodic payment and annuity reinsurance contracts are regarded as limited payment contracts under GAAP. We discount annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums received less brokerage expense at the inception date. Discount rates for most contracts range between 3 % to 7 %. Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. The accounts of our non-U.S.-based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred income tax assets when realization is not likely. Liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. K- 81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 , which provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses. In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts. Discount rate assumptions are established based upon upper-medium grade corporate bond yields that reflect the duration characteristics of the liabilities. ASU 2018-12 also provides for new disclosures. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Prior to ASU 2018-12, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions were set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under certain adverse circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements. We adopted ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method. Revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions were applied to contracts in-force between January 1, 2021 (the transition date) and December 31, 2022 with liabilities remeasured, with the cumulative effect from discount rate changes (based on prevailing interest rates) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes in retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2018-12 produced a cumulative after-tax reduction in our originally reported consolidated shareholders’ equity at the end of 2020 of approximately $ 6.4 billion (or 1.4 %), consisting of reductions to accumulated other comprehensive income of $ 5.7 billion and retained earnings of $ 700 million. The cumulative decline in shareholders’ equity decreased to approximately $ 4.6 billion (or 0.9 % of the shareholders’ equity originally reported) at December 31, 2021. The cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2018-12 will increase our shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 by approximately $ 1.0 billion. These effects reflect the after-tax increases or decreases to our life, health and annuity benefits liabilities and reinsurance recoverables, primarily derived from changes in discount rate assumptions. The effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be reflected primarily in other comprehensive income and the impact on our consolidated net earnings for each of the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 is not material. Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed in each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 follows. On October 19, 2022 , Berkshire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) for approximately $ 11.5 billion, which includes the value of certain Alleghany equity awards, pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger dated as of March 20, 2022 . Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. K- 82 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The preliminary values of the Alleghany identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed are summarized as follows (in millions). Valuations of certain assets, such as intangible assets and goodwill, and certain liabilities as of the acquisition date have not been finalized at this time and are provisional. Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills $ 3,762 Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities 15,982 Loans and other receivables 5,650 Goodwill and other intangible assets 6,362 Other 3,834 Assets acquired $ 35,590 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 15,080 Unearned premiums 3,536 Notes payable 2,169 Other 3,300 Liabilities assumed 24,085 Net assets $ 11,505 Alleghany’s consolidated revenues and net earnings included in Berkshire’s Consolidated Financial Statements in 2022 were approximately $ 2.4 billion and $ 216 million, respectively. The following table sets forth certain unaudited pro forma consolidated earnings data for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, as if the Alleghany acquisition was consummated on the same terms at the beginning of 2021 (in millions, except per share amounts). 2022 2021 Revenues $ 311,184 $ 287,450 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders ( 24,107 ) 90,728 Net earnings (loss) per equivalent Class A common share ( 16,412 ) 60,077 Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired certain businesses of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) on November 1, 2020 for cash of approximately $ 2.5 billion. The acquired businesses included natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”). As part of the Dominion acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25 % economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100 % of the general partnership interest and 25 % of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary. Investments in fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are summarized by type below (in millions).

Investments in foreign governments include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 93 % of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2022 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Amounts are in millions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayment rights held by issuers.

During 2022, we began acquiring common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and our aggregate voting interest exceeded 20 % on August 4, 2022. We adopted the equity method with respect to our investment in Occidental common stock as of that date and included this investment in equity method investments at December 31, 2022. See Note 5. We continue to report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. K- 84 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Our investment in Occidental preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion and our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable at 110 % of the liquidation preference plus accrued dividends under specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 20.4 % of the outstanding common stock of the American Express Company (“American Express”). Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and, as of August 4, 2022, Occidental. We own 26.6 % of Kraft Heinz common stock and 21.4 % of Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental common stock warrants. See Note 4. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemical manufacturing businesses. Occidental’s midstream businesses purchase, market, gather, process, transport and store various oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide and other products. Occidental’s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Our earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 included our equity method share of Occidental’s third quarter earnings. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and carrying values of these two investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions). Carrying Value Fair Value December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Kraft Heinz $ 12,937 $ 13,112 $ 13,249 $ 11,683 Occidental 11,484 — 12,242 — Other 3,629 2,933 $ 28,050 $ 16,045 Our earnings and distributions received from significant equity method investments are summarized in the table below (in millions). As previously indicated, we are reporting the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag, thus the earnings we recorded in 2022 below do not reflect Occidental’s results for its fourth quarter.

Since 2017, we have owned a 38.6 % interest in Pilot. We acquired an additional 41.4 % interest on January 31, 2023 and became the majority owner of Pilot at that date. As a result, we discontinued the use of the equity method during the first quarter of 2023. See Note 26. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $ 1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 are summarized as follows (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the year on securities held at the end of the year $ ( 63,120 ) $ 76,375 $ 54,951 Investment gains (losses) during the year on securities sold ( 3,927 ) 997 ( 14,036 ) ( 67,047 ) 77,372 40,915 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 134 85 56 Gross realized losses ( 684 ) ( 29 ) ( 27 ) Other ( 26 ) 148 ( 39 ) Investment gains (losses) ( 67,623 ) 77,576 40,905 Derivative contract gains (losses) ( 276 ) 966 ( 159 ) $ ( 67,899 ) $ 78,542 $ 40,746 K- 86 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 33.7 billion in 2022, $ 15.8 billion in 2021 and $ 38.8 billion in 2020 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $ 769 million in 2022, $ 3.6 billion in 2021 and $ 6.2 billion in 2020. Our derivative contract gains and losses derived from equity index put option contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we had three open contracts, one of which has since expired. Our exposure to losses in the future is insignificant. Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions). December 31, 2022 2021 Loans and finance receivables before allowances and discounts $ 24,664 $ 22,065 Allowances for credit losses ( 856 ) ( 765 ) Unamortized acquisition discounts and points ( 600 ) ( 549 ) $ 23,208 $ 20,751 Loans and finance receivables are principally manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans.

Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $ 35 billion as ordinary dividends during 2023. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $ 4.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 6.4 billion at December 31, 2021. Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $ 272 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 301 billion at December 31, 2021. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes. Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 follows (in millions). The changes in claim liabilities in 2022 within this table include Alleghany’s property and casualty claim liabilities beginning as of the October 19, 2022 acquisition date. 2022 2021 2020 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 86,664 $ 79,854 $ 73,019 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,960 ) ( 2,912 ) ( 2,855 ) Net liabilities 83,704 76,942 70,164 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 59,463 52,099 43,400 Prior accident years ( 2,672 ) ( 3,116 ) ( 356 ) Total 56,791 48,983 43,044 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 27,236 ) ( 22,897 ) ( 17,884 ) Prior accident years ( 23,083 ) ( 18,904 ) ( 18,862 ) Total ( 50,319 ) ( 41,801 ) ( 36,746 ) Foreign currency effect ( 508 ) ( 420 ) 480 Net liabilities of acquired businesses (see Note 2) 12,779 — — Balances at December 31: Net liabilities 102,447 83,704 76,942 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 5,025 2,960 2,912 Gross liabilities $ 107,472 $ 86,664 $ 79,854 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $ 150 million per event) were approximately $ 3.1 billion in 2022 ($ 2.5 billion from Hurricane Ian), $ 2.9 billion in 2021 and $ 950 million in 2020. Significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida ($ 1.5 billion), Winter Storm Uri and floods in Europe, while significant catastrophe events in 2020 included losses from Hurricanes Laura and Sally (about $ 600 million in the aggregate) and U.S. wildfires. Current accident year incurred losses for private passenger auto insurance increased significantly in 2022 and 2021, attributable to increases in claims frequencies and severities. K- 92 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 2.7 billion in 2022, $ 3.1 billion in 2021 and $ 356 million in 2020, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 3.2 % in 2022, 4.0 % in 2021 and 0.5 % in 2020. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses by $ 1.1 billion in 2022, $ 2.4 billion in 2021 and $ 518 million in 2020. The reductions in each year derived primarily from private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases with respect to other casualty claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $ 1.6 billion in 2022 and $ 718 million in 2021 and increased $ 162 million in 2020. The reductions in 2022 and 2021 reflected reduced estimates for both property and casualty claims. In 2020, increases in casualty claims estimates were partly offset by reductions in property estimates. Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures were approximately $ 2.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims. Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The accident year data for Alleghany’s primary insurance business is included in Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and for its reinsurance business is included in Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, BH Primary and BHRG to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2022 follows (in millions). GEICO BH Primary BHRG Physical Damage Auto Liability Medical Professional Liability Workers’ Compensation/ Other Casualty Property Casualty Total Unpaid losses and ALAE, net $ 884 $ 20,930 $ 8,980 $ 18,491 $ 16,552 $ 31,366 $ 97,203 Reinsurance recoverable 5 867 28 1,543 787 1,439 4,669 Unallocated loss adjustment expenses 2,232 Other losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,368 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 107,472 GEICO GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K- 93 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all auto policy coverages. Dollars are in millions.

Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent developments based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

These methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates. K- 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. As previously noted, Alleghany was acquired on October 19, 2022. Alleghany’s incurred and paid losses and ALAE are included for all years presented retrospectively in the tables that follow. Dollars are in millions.

Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and reconciliations of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022 follow (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Balances at beginning of year $ 37,855 $ 40,623 $ 41,927 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — 153 — Prior years’ contracts 86 ( 974 ) ( 399 ) Total 86 ( 821 ) ( 399 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 2,358 ) ( 1,889 ) ( 1,076 ) Foreign currency effect ( 168 ) ( 58 ) 171 Balances at December 31 $ 35,415 $ 37,855 $ 40,623 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses above $ 86 $ ( 821 ) $ ( 399 ) Deferred charge amortization and adjustments 769 1,802 1,306 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings $ 855 $ 981 $ 907 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposures to losses began. We believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is irrelevant given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts and that the classification of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $ 9.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 10.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses include claim payments attributable to a contract between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Claim payments under the AIG contract commenced in 2021 and were $ 1.5 billion in 2022 and $ 1.2 billion in 2021. Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 13.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 15.8 billion at December 31, 2021. In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes. Estimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $ 12.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. K- 99 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The carrying value of n otes payable and other borrowings is summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of December 31, 2022. Weighted Average December 31, Interest Rate 2022 2021 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”): U.S. Dollar denominated due 2023 - 2047 3.2 % $ 6,231 $ 6,820 Euro denominated due 2023 - 2041 1.0 % 7,344 7,792 Japanese Yen denominated due 2023 - 2060 0.7 % 7,818 6,797 Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”): U.S. Dollar denominated due 2027 - 2052 3.6 % 14,458 10,758 Great Britain Pound denominated due 2039 - 2059 2.5 % 2,078 2,325 Euro denominated due 2030 - 2034 1.8 % 1,332 — Other subsidiary borrowings due 2023 - 2051 4.3 % 5,967 4,438 Short-term subsidiary borrowings 5.8 % 1,310 342 $ 46,538 $ 39,272 In January 2022, Berkshire issued ¥ 128.5 billion (approximately $ 1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. In December 2022, Berkshire issued ¥ 115.0 billion (approximately $ 840 million) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.1 %. In the first two months of 2023, Berkshire repaid $ 1.1 billion of maturing senior notes. An additional $ 3.2 billion of Berkshire senior notes mature in March and April of 2023. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $ 4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 % and € 1.25 billion (approximately $ 1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8 %. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 3.7 billion at December 31, 2022, of which $ 1.0 billion matured in January 2023 . Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Other subsidiary and short-term subsidiary borrowings as of December 31, 2022 includes approximately $ 2.3 billion attributable to Alleghany Corporation and its subsidiaries. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 8.15 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 1,029 billion par at December 31, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 1.7 billion in 2022, $ 1.3 billion in 2021 and pre-tax losses of $ 1.0 billion in 2020. Weighted Average December 31, Interest Rate 2022 2021 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2053 4.3 % $ 13,996 $ 13,003 Subsidiary and other debt due 2023 - 2064 4.3 % 37,639 36,759 Short-term borrowings 5.2 % 1,119 2,009 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) and subsidiaries due 2023 - 2097 4.5 % 23,452 23,219 $ 76,206 $ 74,990 K- 100 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In 2022, BHE issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.6 % senior notes due in 2053 . During 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $ 3.0 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2 % as of December 31 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2053 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2022, BNSF issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.45 % debentures due in 2053 . As of December 31, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 11.1 billion at December 31, 2022, which included approximately $ 9.1 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. Debt principal repayments expected during each of the next five years are as follows (in millions). Amounts in 2023 include short-term borrowings. 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Insurance and other $ 7,080 $ 1,975 $ 3,122 $ 3,454 $ 2,870 Railroad, utilities and energy 5,882 4,281 3,919 1,498 1,686 $ 12,962 $ 6,256 $ 7,041 $ 4,952 $ 4,556 Liabilities for income taxes reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows (in millions).

Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support ongoing business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes. Income tax expense (benefit) reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 was as follows (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Federal $ ( 10,360 ) $ 20,345 $ 10,596 State 762 ( 527 ) 1,086 Foreign 1,080 1,061 758 $ ( 8,518 ) $ 20,879 $ 12,440 Current $ 4,815 $ 5,326 $ 5,052 Deferred ( 13,333 ) 15,553 7,388 $ ( 8,518 ) $ 20,879 $ 12,440 Income tax expense (benefit) is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 in the table below (in millions). 2022 2021 2020 Earnings (loss) before income taxes $ ( 30,576 ) $ 111,686 $ 55,693 Hypothetical income tax expense (benefit) at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ ( 6,421 ) $ 23,454 $ 11,696 Dividends received deduction and tax-exempt interest ( 512 ) ( 457 ) ( 448 ) State income taxes, less U.S. federal income tax effect 602 ( 417 ) 858 U.S. income tax credits* ( 2,187 ) ( 1,860 ) ( 1,519 ) Goodwill impairments — — 1,977 Other differences, net — 159 ( 124 ) $ ( 8,518 ) $ 20,879 $ 12,440 Effective income tax rate 27.9 % 18.7 % 22.3 % * U.S. income tax credits derive primarily from production tax credits associated with wind-energy generation of BHE and tax credits arising from affordable housing investments. We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011 . The 2012 and 2013 tax years are under review by the IRS’s Independent Office of Appeals, and the IRS is currently auditing tax years 2014 through 2019 . We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2023 . We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, net unrecognized tax benefits were $ 440 million and $ 1,046 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2022, were $ 383 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate.

The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the three years ending December 31, 2022 are shown in the table below.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,459,733 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units.

Sales, service and leasing revenues attributable to the United States were 86 % in 2022, 85 % in 2021 and 86 % in 2020 of such amounts. The remainder of sales, service and leasing revenues were primarily in Europe, Canada and the Asia Pacific region. Railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $ 52.1 billion in 2022, $ 48.2 billion in 2021 and $ 41.8 billion in 2020. In each of the three years, approximately 96 % of such revenues were attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2022, approximately 90 % of our consolidated net property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease was located in the United States with the remainder primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom. We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods and services used in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain raw materials purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2022, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $ 12 billion in 2023, $ 5 billion in 2024, $ 3 billion in 2025, $ 2 billion in 2026, $ 2 billion in 2027 and $ 18 billion after 2027. Since October 2017, we have owned a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Through December 31, 2022, we accounted for our investment in Pilot under the equity method and the carrying value of our investment was $ 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4 % interest for approximately $ 8.2 billion. This amount is based on a contractual agreement that is dependent on Pilot’s earnings for 2022 and its net debt at the end of 2022, and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of Pilot’s independent public accountant’s audit of its 2022 financial statements. We obtained control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes on January 31, 2023 and, consequently, we will discontinue the use of the equity method and include Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we are required to remeasure our previously held 38.6 % interest in Pilot to fair value as of January 31, 2023. The excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method will be recorded as a remeasurement gain. Given the proximity of the acquisition date of the additional Pilot interest to the date these Consolidated Financial Statements are issued, it was impracticable to provide an initial estimate of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and residual goodwill or proforma information. We expect to provide such disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning with our interim report for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2023. We may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders for cash or other assets. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Gregory Abel, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $ 870 million. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholder agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE’s noncontrolling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $ 362 million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest. K- 113 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accou ntants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None Item 9A. Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Corporation’s periodic SEC filings.

Business Description Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing, services, retailing and other activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees. Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 372,000 people worldwide at the end of 2021, of which approximately 77% were in the United States and 21% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses individually establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature and size of business activities, policies and practices often vary widely among Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation to employees, which includes various health insurance and retirement benefits, as well as other benefits such as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce. Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks and reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries employed approximately 50,500 people at the end of 2021. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers. In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. K-1 Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the “Insurance Capital Standard”) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standard based on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the “Aggregation Method”). The IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. U.S. state regulators now require insurance groups to file an annual report, the Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAIC recently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the Aggregation Method, which leverages the NAIC’s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC’s group capital calculation is a tool designed to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the near future. Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $301 billion at December 31, 2021. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in any calendar year. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. K-2 In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2022 for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to approximate $ 1.6 billion . There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example: • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports; • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer; • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of local and offshore reinsurance vary; • policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country; • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; • the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary significantly by country; and • regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country. Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach. Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. In 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”), which resulted in the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the EU, and Berkshire continues to maintain a substantial presence in London following Brexit. Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows. GEICO —GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. K-3 GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 26.0% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2020, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2020 of approximately 59.7% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market share being the second largest at approximately 13.5%. GEICO’s written premiums in 2020 were reduced by the effects of the GEICO Giveback Program implemented in response to significant reductions in claim frequencies attributable to reduced policyholder driving during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related premium credit programs of other private passenger insurers may not have been reported as premium reductions, which impacts the industry data reported by A.M Best. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates its current market share is approximately 14.2%. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects those and other service marks through appropriate registrations. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group —The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below. National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner’s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess policies on an admitted and surplus basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several U.S. cities.

USLI companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. K-4 Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide a full suite of commercial insurance products , as well as homeowners policies to over 350,000 small to mid-sized businesses and homeowners . These offerings are made through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”) has been the leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes the majority of its policies on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group —Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business is written through NICO and certain other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the “NICO Group”) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. Property/casualty The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries. The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 12 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG, based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. Life/health The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in 2021 were primarily in the Asia Pacific, United States and Western Europe. Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures. BHLN and affiliates are parties to contracts that reinsure certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar benefit risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity risks under reinsurance contracts, with the most recent contract incepting in 2014. K-5 Retroactive reinsurance NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. Periodic payment annuity BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. Investments of insurance businesses —Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $91 billion at the end of 2016 to approximately $147 billion at the end of 2021. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In each of the three years ending December 31, 2021, Berkshire’s consolidated cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains. Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa Fe Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000 employees at the end of 2021. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business. In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 24% from industrial products, 23% from agricultural products and 15% from coal. K-6 Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business. The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. Environmental Matters BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. Consumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches, that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018. BNSF intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested. Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.

BHE Renewables, based in Iowa, owns interests in independent power projects having approximately 4,900 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Hawaii. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, $6.9 billion has been invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. K-8 Regulatory Matters PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.4 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services. Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023. AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. Environmental Matters BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. K-9 Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force on November 4, 2016. The United States completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 21, 2021, and the United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the United States pledging to cut its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Affordable Clean Energy Rule in its entirety. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case will be held in February 2022 and a decision regarding the scope of the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is expected by June 2022. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy. BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate its greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation, BHE works with its regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability and sources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar and geothermal generation, with cumulative investments of $30.1 billion through 2021 and has retired 16 coal generation units. As a result, BHE has reduced its annual GHG emissions by about 20% from 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation in the future and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.

This business is highly competitive and subject to general real estate market conditions. K-10 Manufacturing Businesses Berkshire’s numerous and diverse manufacturing subsidiaries are grouped into three categories: (1) industrial products, (2) building products and (3) consumer products. Berkshire’s industrial products businesses manufacture components for aerospace and power generation applications, specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, and a variety of other products primarily for industrial use. The building products group produces prefabricated and site-built residential homes, flooring products, insulation, roofing and engineered products, building and engineered components, paint and coatings and bricks and masonry products. The consumer products group manufactures recreational vehicles, alkaline batteries, various apparel products, jewelry and custom picture framing products. Information concerning the major activities of these three groups follows. Berkshire’s manufacturing businesses employed approximately 187,000 people at the end of 2021. Industrial products Precision Castparts Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (“IGT”) and nuclear power plants; downhole casing and tubing, fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil and gas environments; investment castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries; revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications. Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines. PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including seamless pipe for coal-fired, IGT and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and gas markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non-aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titanium products are used to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and other industrial end markets. PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets. PCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). The majority of PCC’s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, delay requests increased, with delivery dates extending in some cases beyond 2021. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020 and 2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking at extraordinary rates. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX also adversely impacted 2020 and 2021 and quality issues with the Boeing 787 negatively impacted 2021. Aircraft build rates have not recovered in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCC significantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. The restructuring actions taken began to improve margins in late 2020 and further margin improvements were achieved in 2021. K-11 PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation. PCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Laws and regulations continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will become more stringent in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change, including reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters. Lubrizol The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”) is a specialty chemical and performance materials company that manufactures products and supplies technologies for the global transportation, industrial and consumer markets. Lubrizol currently operates two business segments: Lubrizol Additives, which produces engine lubricant additives, driveline lubricant additives and industrial specialties products; and Lubrizol Advanced Materials, which includes engineered materials (engineered polymers and performance coatings) and life sciences (beauty and personal care, and health and home care solutions). Lubrizol Additives’ products are used in a broad range of applications including engine oils, transmission fluids, gear oils, specialty driveline lubricants, fuels, metalworking fluids and compressor lubricants for transportation and industrial applications. Lubrizol Advanced Materials’ products are used in many different types of applications including beauty, personal care, home care, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, medical devices, performance coatings, sporting goods, plumbing and fire sprinkler systems. Lubrizol is an industry leader in many of the markets in which it competes, and its principal lubricant additives competitors are Infineum International Ltd., Chevron Oronite Company and Afton Chemical Corporation.

With its considerable patent portfolio, Lubrizol uses its technological leadership position and applies its science capabilities, formulation know-how and market expertise in product development to improve the demand, quality and value of its solutions. Lubrizol also leverages its scientific and applications knowledge to meet and exceed customer performance and sustainability requirements. While Lubrizol typically has patents that expire each year, it invests resources to protect its intellectual property and to develop or acquire innovative products for the markets it serves. Lubrizol uses many specialty and commodity chemical raw materials in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials are primarily feedstocks derived from petroleum and petrochemicals and, generally, are obtainable from several sources. The materials that Lubrizol chooses to purchase from a single source typically are subject to long-term supply contracts to ensure supply reliability. Lubrizol operates its business on a global basis through more than 100 offices, laboratories, production facilities and warehouses on six continents, the most significant of which are North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Lubrizol markets its products worldwide through direct sales, sales agents and distributors. Lubrizol’s customers principally consist of major global and regional oil companies and industrial and consumer products companies. Some of Lubrizol’s largest customers also may be suppliers. During 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Lubrizol’s consolidated revenues. In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse effect on many of the markets that Lubrizol serves, as did worldwide supply chain disruptions, affecting both the availability of raw materials and fulfillment of customer orders. In addition, the occurrence and duration of the February 2021 winter storms and freezing temperatures in Texas significantly interrupted operations at Lubrizol’s manufacturing facilities. Lubrizol expends significant capital to ensure the safety of its employees and the communities where it operates, as well as delivering on its commitments to operational excellence and cybersecurity. Lubrizol also makes significant capital investments to ensure reliable supply and compliance with regulations governing its operations, while reducing their environmental footprint. K-12 Lubrizol is subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws to protect the environment, limit manufacturing waste and emissions, ensure product and employee safety and regulate trade. While the company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are designed to limit the risks of non-compliance with laws and consequent financial liability, it experienced a fire at one of its chemical manufacturing facilities in 2019, which resulted in significant cleanup and remediation costs.

Clayton’s financing programs utilize proprietary loan underwriting guidelines to evaluate loan applicants, which include ability to repay calculations, including debt to income limits, and incorporate residual income and credit score requirements. Since 2015, Clayton’s site-built division, Clayton Properties Group, has expanded through the acquisition of nine builders across 14 states with over 300 subdivisions, supplementing the portfolio of housing products offered to customers. Clayton’s site-builders currently own and control approximately 83,000 homesites, with a home order backlog of approximately $2.5 billion. Historically, access to key inputs such as lumber, steel and resin products has been adequate. During 2021, the availability and pricing of these and other inputs has been volatile. Input shortages coupled with labor and subcontractor availability have increased the time to construct a home, constraining our ability to meet current demand. Clayton’s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting and stormwater protection for site-built home subdivisions.

During 2021, Shaw processed approximately 97% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate, but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers. The soft floor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of key players domestically where the majority of Shaw’s business occurs. There are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in hard surface floor covering production, distribution and sales. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 44% of the total United States consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality, style, price and service.

Competitors include other paint and decorating stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets, such as Sherwin-Williams Company, PPG Industries, Inc., The Valspar Corporation, The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. The most significant raw materials in Benjamin Moore products are titanium dioxide, monomers, polymers and pigments. Historically, these materials have been generally available, with pricing and availability subject to fluctuation. In 2021, raw material supply constraints and increased customer demand for products prevailed and disrupted Benjamin Moore’s ability to build inventory. A major winter storm that impacted the Gulf Coast region of the United States in February of 2021 caused substantial supply chain disruptions for Benjamin Moore, which contributed to significant inflation in manufacturing costs.

As a result, yarn production was primarily with one supplier. Supply chain issues related to the COVID pandemic including labor shortage at suppliers, yarn shortages, and price inflation in raw materials and freight resulted in FOL utilizing alternative sources of raw materials and yarn in 2021. Further, FOL has contracted with an additional supplier for a significant portion of FOL’s yarn spinning/raw material conversion services that is scheduled to begin in July 2022. If relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources of supply, production and operating results can be adversely affected.

Until March 2020, other services included the newspaper publishing businesses conducted through The Buffalo News and BH Media Group, Inc. These operations were sold in 2020. Retailing Businesses Berkshire’s retailing businesses include automotive, home furnishings and several other operations that sell various consumer products. Berkshire’s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of 2021. Information regarding each of these operations follows. Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”) and its affiliates is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 105 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company. Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. K-21 Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. S tates generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law. BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Risk Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. General Business Risks Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses. A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. Cyber security risks We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 91, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 98. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett. Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. K-24 We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value. We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings. Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits. Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. K-25 Risks unique to our regulated businesses Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period. The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses. The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($125 billion at December 31, 2021), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. Climate change may impact our businesses. Climate change could cause increases in hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other risks that could produce losses affecting our businesses. Also, failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretations of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. K-26 Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring , disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses. Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. K-29 Item 4.

Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Security Holder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbols: BRK.A and BRK.B, respectively. Shareholders Berkshire had approximately 1,400 record holders of its Class A common stock and 18,400 record holders of its Class B common stock at February 15, 2022. Record owners included nominees holding at least 346,000 shares of Class A common stock and 1,287,000,000 shares of Class B common stock on behalf of beneficial-but-not-of-record owners. Dividends Berkshire has not declared a cash dividend since 1967. K-30 Common Stock Repurchase Program Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2021 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program October Class A common stock 680 $ 431,525.72 680 * Class B common stock 5,862,551 $ 282.86 5,862,551 * November Class A common stock 403 $ 430,172.46 403 * Class B common stock 7,013,482 $ 284.39 7,013,482 * December Class A common stock 1,828 $ 439,625.92 1,828 * Class B common stock 6,259,164 $ 287.62 6,259,164 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion. Stock Performance Graph The following chart compares the subsequent value of $100 invested in Berkshire common stock on December 31, 2016 with a similar investment in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index and in the Standard & Poor’s Property – Casualty Insurance Index**. * Cumulative return for the Standard & Poor’s indices based on reinvestment of dividends. ** It would be difficult to develop a peer group of companies similar to Berkshire. The Corporation owns subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities of which the most important is the property and casualty insurance business and, accordingly, management has used the Standard & Poor’s Property—Casualty Insurance Index for comparative purposes. K-31 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Insurance – underwriting $ 728 $ 657 $ 325 Insurance – investment income 4,807 5,039 5,530 Railroad 5,990 5,161 5,481 Utilities and energy 3,495 3,091 2,840 Manufacturing, service and retailing 11,120 8,300 9,372 Investment and derivative gains/losses 62,340 31,591 57,445 Other* 1,315 (11,318 ) 424 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 89,795 $ 42,521 $ 81,417 * Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chain disruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed to higher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020 and $325 million in 2019. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020 and declined 8.9% in 2020 versus 2019. Earnings in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. K-32 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined 11.4% in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020. While customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration. Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in 2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 1,259 $ 3,428 $ 1,506 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 607 110 383 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (930 ) (2,700 ) (1,472 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 936 838 417 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 208 181 92 Net underwriting earnings $ 728 $ 657 $ 325 Effective income tax rate 22.2 % 21.5 % 24.2 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 38,395 $ 34,928 $ 36,016 Premiums earned $ 37,706 100.0 $ 35,093 100.0 $ 35,572 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 30,999 82.2 26,018 74.1 28,937 81.3 Underwriting expenses 5,448 14.5 5,647 16.1 5,129 14.5 Total losses and expenses 36,447 96.7 31,665 90.2 34,066 95.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 1,259 $ 3,428 $ 1,506 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2021 and 2020 were significantly affected by changes in average claims frequencies. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies or policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increased due to increases in used vehicle valuations. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years. Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020, which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 included $81 million attributable to Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower nominal expenses and higher premiums earned. 2020 versus 2019 Premiums written and earned in 2020 decreased $1.1 billion (3.0%) and $479 million (1.3%), respectively, compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written $2.9 billion and premiums earned $2.5 billion in 2020. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 820,000 during 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s loss ratio was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs, partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 12,595 $ 10,212 $ 9,843 Premiums earned $ 11,575 100.0 $ 9,615 100.0 $ 9,165 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 8,107 70.0 7,129 74.1 6,336 69.1 Underwriting expenses 2,861 24.8 2,376 24.7 2,446 26.7 Total losses and expenses 10,968 94.8 9,505 98.8 8,782 95.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 607 $ 110 $ 383 Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increases from BH Specialty (36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%), BHHC (5%) and USLI (20%). The increases were across multiple coverages and occurred in several markets. Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. BH Primary’s loss ratios were 70.0% in 2021, 74.1% in 2020 and 69.1% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $402 million in 2021 from Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri and $207 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $631 million in 2021, $265 million in 2020 and $499 million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of $167 million attributable to the pandemic. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business, changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relatively unchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes in business mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. K-36 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Property/casualty $ 14,149 $ 13,295 $ 10,428 $ 13,740 $ 12,214 $ 9,911 $ 667 $ (799 ) $ 16 Life/health 5,621 5,848 4,963 5,648 5,861 4,869 (421 ) (18 ) 159 Retroactive reinsurance 136 38 684 136 38 684 (782 ) (1,248 ) (1,265 ) Periodic payment annuity 658 566 863 658 566 863 (508 ) (617 ) (549 ) Variable annuity 15 14 14 15 14 14 114 (18 ) 167 $ 20,579 $ 19,761 $ 16,952 $ 20,197 $ 18,693 $ 16,341 $ (930 ) $ (2,700 ) $ (1,472 ) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 14,149 $ 13,295 $ 10,428 Premiums earned $ 13,740 100.0 $ 12,214 100.0 $ 9,911 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,878 71.9 9,898 81.0 7,313 73.8 Underwriting expenses 3,195 23.2 3,115 25.5 2,582 26.0 Total losses and expenses 13,073 95.1 13,013 106.5 9,895 99.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 667 $ (799 ) $ 16 Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business, increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily attributable to property coverages. Premiums written increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to net new business and increased participations on renewals. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020, while the loss ratio decreased 9.1 percentage points. The loss ratio was 71.9% in 2021, 81.0% in 2020 and 73.8% in 2019. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events in 2021 (Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe and Winter Storm Uri) were $2.1 billion, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $718 million. Losses incurred in 2020 included $667 million from significant catastrophe events (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires), losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of $964 million and increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $162 million. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events during 2019 were $1.0 billion and derived from Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $295 million. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. Underwriting expenses increased $533 million (20.6%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the increase in premiums earned.

Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 and did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, attributable to the pandemic. Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163 million attributable to an amendment of a yearly renewable term life contract. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency gains of $56 million in 2021 and losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $838 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and $1.2 billion in 2019. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for contracts written in prior years were reduced $974 million in 2021 and $399 million in 2020. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such reductions produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million in 2021 and $230 million in 2020. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $38.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $2.7 billion since December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily attributable to paid claims of approximately $1.9 billion and the reduction in estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2020, attributable to the effects of the changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments and periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $92 million (16.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which decreased $297 million (34.4%) versus 2019. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premium volumes in 2021 and 2020 were affected by pandemic-related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced the supply of available business. Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $18 million in 2021 and losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019. Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $526 million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18 million in 2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Interest and other investment income $ 589 $ 1,059 $ 2,075 (44.4 )% (49.0 )% Dividend income 5,060 4,890 4,525 3.5 8.1 Pre-tax net investment income 5,649 5,949 6,600 (5.0 ) (9.9 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 842 910 1,070 Net investment income $ 4,807 $ 5,039 $ 5,530 Effective income tax rate 14.9 % 15.3 % 16.1 % Interest and other investment income declined $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. K-39 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Dividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2021, $138 billion at December 31, 2020 and $129 billion at December 31, 2019. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for each year was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions).

K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Railroad operating revenues $ 22,513 $ 20,181 $ 22,745 11.6 % (11.3 )% Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,696 4,542 5,270 3.4 (13.8 ) Fuel 2,766 1,789 2,944 54.6 (39.2 ) Purchased services 2,033 1,954 2,049 4.0 (4.6 ) Depreciation and amortization 2,444 2,460 2,389 (0.7 ) 3.0 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,763 1,684 2,028 4.7 (17.0 ) Total 13,702 12,429 14,680 10.2 (15.3 ) Railroad operating earnings 8,811 7,752 8,065 13.7 (3.9 ) Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 769 688 770 11.8 (10.6 ) Other expenses, net (687 ) (611 ) (515 ) 12.4 18.6 Interest expense (1,032 ) (1,037 ) (1,070 ) (0.5 ) (3.1 ) Pre-tax earnings 7,861 6,792 7,250 15.7 (6.3 ) Income taxes 1,871 1,631 1,769 14.7 (7.8 ) Net earnings $ 5,990 $ 5,161 $ 5,481 16.1 (5.8 ) Effective income tax rate 23.8 % 24.0 % 24.4 % The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Consumer products 5,673 5,266 5,342 7.7 % (1.4 )% Industrial products 1,709 1,622 1,931 5.4 (16.0 ) Agricultural products 1,224 1,189 1,146 2.9 3.8 Coal 1,529 1,404 1,802 8.9 (22.1 ) Total cars/units 10,135 9,481 10,221 6.9 (7.2 ) 2021 versus 2020 Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain. K-41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Continued) Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs. 2020 versus 2019 Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of 2020 and caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. Volumes sequentially improved during the second half of 2020 from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019. Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half of 2020. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Continued) Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which lowered sand and petroleum products volume, and reduced steel demand, which lowered taconite volume. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain and meal exports, partially offset by lower ethanol and sweeteners shipments. Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures. Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses. Utilities and Energy We currently own a 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S”). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 18,935 $ 15,556 $ 15,371 Real estate operating revenue 6,215 5,396 4,473 Other income (loss) (163 ) 79 270 Total revenue 24,987 21,031 20,114 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 5,504 4,187 4,586 Energy operating expense 8,535 7,539 6,824 Real estate operating costs and expense 5,710 4,885 4,251 Interest expense 2,054 1,941 1,835 Total costs and expense 21,803 18,552 17,496 Pre-tax earnings 3,184 2,479 2,618 Income tax expense (benefit)* (1,177 ) (1,010 ) (526 ) Net earnings after income taxes 4,361 3,489 3,144 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 399 71 18 Net earnings attributable to BHE 3,962 3,418 3,126 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 467 327 286 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 3,495 $ 3,091 $ 2,840 Effective income tax rate (37.0 )% (40.7 )% (20.1 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generat ion. The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 PacifiCorp $ 889 $ 741 $ 773 20.0 % (4.1 )% MidAmerican Energy Company 883 818 781 7.9 4.7 NV Energy 439 410 365 7.1 12.3 Northern Powergrid 247 201 256 22.9 (21.5 ) Natural gas pipelines 774 528 422 46.6 25.1 Other energy businesses 680 697 608 (2.4 ) 14.6 Real estate brokerage 387 375 160 3.2 134.4 Corporate interest and other (337 ) (352 ) (239 ) (4.3 ) 47.3 $ 3,962 $ 3,418 $ 3,126 15.9 9.3 2021 versus 2020 PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings increased $148 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increase was partially offset by lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses in 2021 reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effective January 1, 2021, and incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, offset by lower costs associated with wildfires and a settlement agreement. K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $145 million compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $65 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by lower storm restoration costs. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC electric utility margin increased $190 million to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The electric utility margin increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes, as well as favorable wholesale prices, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers and the favorable impacts of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $29 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, lower net interest and finance expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases in operating expenses were mainly due to lower earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy’s electric utility margin decreased $97 million to $1.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by a 3.3% increase in electric retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impacts of weather. Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $46 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs, lower pension expense and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021, partially offset by the impact of increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate. Earnings in 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Earnings in 2020 included deferred income tax expense of $35 million related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to 19%, effective April 1, 2020. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $246 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included BHE GT&S for the full year compared to two months in 2020. The incremental earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were $211 million. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings in 2021 decreased $17 million compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Earnings in 2021 from other energy projects increased due to higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and a transmission investment, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to a comparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower funded mortgage volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable comparative state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020. K-45 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Continued) 2020 versus 2019 PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service, higher utility margin and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from an increase in average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower operating revenue from a decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MEC after-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather. NV Energy after-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to $73 million of earnings from BHE GT&S, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses. Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits. K-46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).

These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the “Other Berkshire corporate” earnings section on page K-56. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Revenues Industrial products $ 28,176 $ 25,667 $ 30,594 9.8 % (16.1 )% Building products 24,974 21,244 20,327 17.6 4.5 Consumer products 15,580 12,168 11,809 28.0 3.0 $ 68,730 $ 59,079 $ 62,730 Pretax earnings Industrial products $ 4,469 $ 3,755 $ 5,635 19.0 % (33.4 )% Building products 3,390 2,858 2,636 18.6 8.4 Consumer products 1,982 1,397 1,251 41.9 11.7 $ 9,841 $ 8,010 $ 9,522 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 15.9 % 14.6 % 18.4 % Building products 13.6 % 13.5 % 13.0 % Consumer products 12.7 % 11.5 % 10.6 % K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared 2020. PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets in 2021 versus 2020, demand remains well below pre-pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for travel, however, the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air traffic recovery will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, though likely more on a seasonal or localized basis as the pandemic shifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finished goods inventory following quality issues with the Boeing 737 and Boeing 787 planes and industry supply chain issues. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects the actions taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC’s products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospace revenues or earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing’s significant inventory levels and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021, which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the second half of 2021. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant losses related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. These losses and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the effects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives production facilities, which resulted in lost sales and incremental manufacturing costs. Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased 40.3% compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins. Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group was 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019. PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2% in 2020, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $650 million in 2020, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects of the pandemic, PCC took aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% from the end of 2019. PCC recorded restructuring, inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates. Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire. Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies groups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services groups. Marmon acquired the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, which represents Marmon’s Medical group. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales mix. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 2021 versus 2020 Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses was due to fewer actual and anticipated loan foreclosures. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. In addition, higher costs for raw materials and freight and higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, in part attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). 2021 versus 2020 Consumer products revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs. Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses, Richline and Larson-Juhl. However, our consumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year. 2020 versus 2019 Consumer products revenues increased $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) The comparative increase in revenues reflected increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility. Pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion in 2020, an increase of $146 million (11.7%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The overall increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Revenues Service $ 15,872 $ 12,346 $ 13,496 28.6 % (8.5 )% Retailing 18,960 15,832 15,991 19.8 (1.0 ) McLane 49,450 46,840 50,458 5.6 (7.2 ) $ 84,282 $ 75,018 $ 79,945 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 2,672 $ 1,600 $ 1,681 67.0 % (4.8 )% Retailing 1,809 1,028 874 76.0 17.6 McLane 230 251 288 (8.4 ) (12.8 ) $ 4,711 $ 2,879 $ 2,843 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.8 % 13.0 % 12.5 % Retailing 9.5 % 6.5 % 5.5 % McLane 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.6 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%). Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand. 2020 versus 2019 Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to 2019. The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in customer flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. These declines were partially offset by revenue increases from TTI and WPLG. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses of approximately $165 million recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 62% of our combined retailing revenue in 2021. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) 2021 versus 2020 Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales in 2021 increased $1.7 billion (20.7%) versus 2020, primarily due to higher average selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at OEMs attributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0% in 2021 as compared to 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs. Pre-tax earnings in 2021 of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating cost control efforts. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020. 2020 versus 2019 Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations. BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels. The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened. Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions and lower advertising and other operating expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of the pandemic. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) McLane McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2021 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 2021 versus 2020 Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5% compared to 2020, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs reflected in a LIFO inventory reserve increase of $130 million, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we are experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, our hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19-related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Investment gains/losses $ 77,576 $ 40,905 $ 71,123 Derivative contract gains/losses 966 (159 ) 1,484 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 78,542 40,746 72,607 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 16,202 9,155 15,162 Net earnings $ 62,340 $ 31,591 $ 57,445 Effective income tax rate 20.4 % 21.7 % 20.9 % K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, $55.0 billion in 2020 and $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including gains of $1.0 billion in 2021, losses of $14.0 billion in 2020 and gains of $1.6 billion in 2019. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.6 billion in 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our periodic consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired. Contracts comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three years were insignificant. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Equity method earnings $ 881 $ 665 $ 1,023 Acquisition accounting expenses (690 ) (783 ) (788 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments — (10,381 ) (96 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (305 ) (334 ) (280 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 955 (764 ) 58 Other Berkshire corporate 474 279 507 $ 1,315 $ (11,318 ) $ 424 After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $317 million in 2021, $170 million in 2020 and $488 million in 2019. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such charges was $259 million in 2021, $611 million in 2020 and $339 million in 2019. K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other (Continued) After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional details. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $61.6 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our periodic earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At December 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $143.9 billion, which included $119.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $367.2 billion. Our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 included approximately $14.4 billion of investments that mature in 2022 and 2023. Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $114.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $10.2 in 2022; $14.6 in 2023; $9.7 in 2024; $9.9 in 2025; and $8.7 in 2026. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $21.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt. In 2021, Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion of maturing senior notes and issued Euro and Yen denominated senior notes aggregating approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During 2021, BNSF repaid $1.54 billion of debt and issued $1.55 billion of debentures with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1% with maturity dates in 2051 and 2052. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $382 million since December 31, 2020. In 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and repaid term debt of approximately $2.5 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $39 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.3 billion in 2021, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $9.5 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $11.1 billion in 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.6 in 2022; $1.5 in 2023; $1.4 in 2024; $1.2 in 2025; and $1.2 in 2026. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021. We currently forecast claim payments in 2022 of approximately $29 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2022. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows. Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2021, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2021 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2021. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $290 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2021 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 6,602 $ 9,630 $ 16,232 IBNR liabilities 6,780 15,227 22,007 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 13,382 24,857 38,239 Reinsurance recoverable 181 892 1,073 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 13,201 $ 23,965 $ 37,166 K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2021, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2021, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $136 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $375 million in 2021. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $950 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $950 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2021, gross unpaid losses were $38.3 billion and deferred charges were $10.6 billion. Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021, which after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $142 million. In 2021, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that amortization expense in 2022 will approximate $950 million. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.9 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K-62 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) As of December 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions we were taking or may be taking in the future to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2021, approximately 73% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four companies. We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. K-63 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk (Continued) We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts, although our equity price exposure has declined significantly as a vast majority of the contracts written to date have expired. Our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors. The following table summarizes our equity securities and equity index put option contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Prices Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Earnings (1) December 31, 2021 Investments in equity securities $ 350,719 30% increase $ 452,936 $ 81,136 30% decrease 248,606 (81,053 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 99 30% increase 5 74 30% decrease 1,088 (781 ) December 31, 2020 Investments in equity securities $ 281,170 30% increase $ 362,830 $ 63,321 30% decrease 199,547 (63,293 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 1,065 30% increase 257 638 30% decrease 2,702 (1,293 ) (1) The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risks associated with the valuations of our equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. K-64 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way. K-65 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Foreign Currency Risk (Continued) Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in net earnings related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities of Berkshire and U.S.-based subsidiaries. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions). 2021 2020 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ 955 $ (764 ) Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings 58 (163 ) Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income (1,021 ) 1,264 Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f).

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February 26, 2022 K-66 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Omaha, Nebraska Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. K-67 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) under short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are $86,664 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others: • We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions. • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by: • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities. • With the assistance of our actuarial specialists: • We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 17 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance contracts are $38,256 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following, among others: • We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities and related assets, including those over the key assumptions. K-68 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities and related assets by: • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities and related assets. • With the assistance of our actuarial specialists: • We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts and related assets, we evaluated the process used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities and related assets. • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessed unexpected development and assessed internal rates of return. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2021. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’ disclosures. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and discount rate selected by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Omaha, Nebraska February 26, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1985.

(“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 25. Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected nearly all of our operations during 2020, although the effects varied significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms on the demand for certain of our products and services cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. (d) Investments in fixed maturity securities We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (d) Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued) We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. (e) Investments in equity securities We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses. (f) Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20 % of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. (g) Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (h) Other receivables Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history. Beginning in 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for credit losses. In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. ( i ) Derivatives We carry derivative contracts in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j) Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. (k) Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2021, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 31 % of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $ 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. (l) Property, plant and equipment We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment (Continued) Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years , machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years , interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years . We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m) Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years . We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. (n) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (o) Revenue recognition We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally earned in proportion to the coverage provided, which is generally ratable over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are usually received in full at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (o) Revenue recognition (Continued) Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases. (p) Losses and loss adjustment expenses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. (q) Retroactive reinsurance contracts We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (r) Insurance policy acquisition costs We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized over the expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy. Such anticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately $ 3.4 billion and $ 3.25 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. K-80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (s) Life and annuity insurance benefits We compute liabilities for benefits under life insurance contracts based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates for most contracts range from 3 % to 7 %. (t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. (u) Foreign currency The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. (v) Income taxes Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is not likely. Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. K-81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (w) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020 We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses. (x) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019 Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019 with respect to contracts in effect as of the adoption and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Upon adoption, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $ 6.2 billion, lease liabilities of $ 5.9 billion and reduced other assets by approximately $ 300 million. (y) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2021 In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts. The effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, which provides that the revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) be applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be included in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We also preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 will increase our life, health and annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due to the historically low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We, therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired certain businesses of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) on November 1, 2020 , pursuant to a definitive agreement with Dominion in July 2020 . The acquired businesses included natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”). In October 2020 , BHE and Dominion also agreed to provide for the exclusion of certain pipeline businesses from the initial agreement and entered into a second acquisition agreement with respect to the excluded pipeline businesses. The closing of the second agreement was subject to regulatory and customary closing conditions; however, in July 2021 , BHE and Dominion agreed to terminate the second agreement. K-82 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2) Business acquisitions (Continued) The cost of the acquisition was approximately $ 2.5 billion after post-closing adjustments as provided in the agreement. The fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill are summarized as follows (in millions). Property, plant and equipment $ 9,264 Goodwill 1,741 Other 2,398 Assets acquired $ 13,403 Notes payable and other borrowings $ 5,615 Other 1,358 Liabilities assumed 6,973 Noncontrolling interests 3,916 Net assets $ 2,514 As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25 % economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100 % of the general partnership interest and 25 % of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary. The noncontrolling interests are attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties. In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-ons” to several of our existing business operations. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized by type below (in millions). Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value December 31, 2021 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 3,286 $ 22 $ ( 5 ) $ 3,303 Foreign governments 10,998 29 ( 33 ) 10,994 Corporate bonds 1,363 412 ( 1 ) 1,774 Other 317 47 ( 1 ) 363 $ 15,964 $ 510 $ ( 40 ) $ 16,434 December 31, 2020 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 3,348 $ 55 $ — $ 3,403 Foreign governments 11,233 110 ( 5 ) 11,338 Corporate bonds 4,729 464 ( 2 ) 5,191 Other 414 66 ( 2 ) 478 $ 19,724 $ 695 $ ( 9 ) $ 20,410 Investments in foreign governments include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 93 % of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Amounts are in millions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayment rights held by issuers. Due in one year or less Due after one year through five years Due after five years through ten years Due after ten years Mortgage-backed securities Total Amortized cost $ 9,171 $ 6,044 $ 307 $ 207 $ 235 $ 15,964 Fair value 9,165 6,086 559 347 277 16,434 K-83 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (4) Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized based on the primary industry of the investee in the table below (in millions). Cost Basis Net Unrealized Gains Fair Value December 31, 2021 * Banks, insurance and finance $ 26,822 $ 62,236 $ 89,058 Consumer products 36,076 154,945 191,021 Commercial, industrial and other 41,707 28,933 70,640 $ 104,605 $ 246,114 $ 350,719 * Approximately 73 % of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in four companies (American Express Company – $ 24.8 billion; Apple Inc. – $ 161.2 billion; Bank of America Corporation – $ 46.0 billion and The Coca-Cola Company – $ 23.7 billion). Cost Basis Net Unrealized Gains Fair Value December 31, 2020 * Banks, insurance and finance $ 26,312 $ 40,167 $ 66,479 Consumer products 34,747 111,583 146,330 Commercial, industrial and other 47,561 20,800 68,361 $ 108,620 $ 172,550 $ 281,170 * Approximately 68 % of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in four companies (American Express Company – $ 18.3 billion; Apple Inc. – $ 120.4 billion; Bank of America Corporation – $ 31.3 billion and The Coca-Cola Company – $ 21.9 billion). Investments in commercial, industrial and other equity securities include our investments in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”), which we acquired in 2019. These investments were acquired for a total of $ 10 billion and consist of Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion and warrants, which currently permit us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under certain specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. ( 5) Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 26.6 % of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $ 269 million in 2021, $ 95 million in 2020 and $ 493 million in 2019. Equity method earnings included the effects of goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $ 350 million in 2021, $ 850 million in 2020 and $ 450 million in 2019. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $ 521 million in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, which we recorded as reductions in our carrying value. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 11.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 13.3 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by approximately 11 % of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required as of December 31, 2021. K-84 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) ( 5) Equity method investments (Continued) Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Assets $ 93,394 $ 99,830 Liabilities 43,942 49,587 Year ending December 25, 2021 Year ending December 26, 2020 Year ending December 28, 2019 Sales $ 26,042 $ 26,185 $ 24,977 Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders $ 1,012 $ 356 $ 1,935 Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”) and beginning in 2021, Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. (“Iroquois”). The aggregate carrying value of our investments in these entities was $ 4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our equity method earnings in these entities were $ 726 million in 2021, $ 631 million in 2020 and $ 683 million in 2019. During 2021, we received distributions of approximately $ 1.2 billion from these investees. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Berkadia funds a portion of its operations through commercial paper borrowings, which are currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On December 31, 2021, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. BHE subsidiaries own a 50 % noncontrolling interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas and a 50 % noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut. We own a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America with more than 800 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. Pilot’s revenues in 2021 were approximately $ 45 billion. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We have an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. (6) Investment and derivative contract gains/losses Investment and derivative contract gains/losses for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 are summarized as follows (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the year on securities held at the end of the year $ 76,375 $ 54,951 $ 69,581 Investment gains (losses) during the year on securities sold 997 ( 14,036 ) 1,585 77,372 40,915 71,166 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 85 56 87 Gross realized losses ( 29 ) ( 27 ) ( 25 ) Other 148 ( 39 ) ( 105 ) Investment gains (losses) 77,576 40,905 71,123 Derivative contract gains (losses) 966 ( 159 ) 1,484 $ 78,542 $ 40,746 $ 72,607 K-85 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (6) Investment and derivative contract gains/losses (Continued) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on equity securities we still owned at the end of the year, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 15.8 billion in 2021, $ 38.8 billion in 2020 and $ 14.3 billion in 2019 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains were $ 3.6 billion in 2021, $ 6.2 billion in 2020 and $ 3.2 billion in 2019. The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions). December 31, 2021 2020 Balance sheet liabilities - at fair value $ 99 $ 1,065 Notional value 6,992 10,991 Intrinsic value — 727 Weighted average remaining life (in years) 0.5 1.2 Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero on each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Contracts comprising 63 % of the notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022 . Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums on the contract inception dates of $ 1.3 billion with respect to unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2021 and we have no counterparty credit risk. (7) Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions). December 31, 2021 2020 Loans and finance receivables before allowances and discounts $ 22,065 $ 20,436 Allowances for credit losses ( 765 ) ( 712 ) Unamortized acquisition discounts and points ( 549 ) ( 523 ) $ 20,751 $ 19,201 Loans and finance receivables are principally manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. Reconciliations of the allowance for credit losses on loans and finance receivables for 2021, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of year $ 712 $ 167 $ 177 Adoption of ASC 326 — 486 — Provision for credit losses 88 177 125 Charge-offs, net of recoveries ( 35 ) ( 118 ) ( 135 ) Balance at December 31 $ 765 $ 712 $ 167 At December 31, 2021, approximately 99 % of manufactured and site-built home loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment. At December 31, 2021, we considered approximately 97 % of the loan balances to be current as to payment status. A summary of performing and non-performing home loans before discounts and allowances by year of loan origination as of December 31, 2021 follows (in millions).

The Seritage loan is pursuant to a $ 2.0 billion term loan facility and the outstanding loan is secured by mortgages on its real estate properties. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the loan agreement with Seritage was amended to allow optional loan prepayments without penalty and on December 31, 2021, Seritage made a loan prepayment of $ 160 million. The amendments further provide Seritage with the option to extend the maturity of the loan to July 31, 2025 , if the outstanding principal has been reduced to $ 800 million by the original expiration date of July 31, 2023 . The loan to Lee matures in 2045 and was made in connection with its acquisition of our newspaper operations and the repayment by Lee of its then outstanding credit facilities. We are the sole lender to each of these entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status. (8) Other receivables Other receivables are comprised of the following (in millions).

We primarily lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. The weighted average remaining term of our operating leases was approximately 7.2 years at December 31, 2021 and 7.3 years at December 31, 2020. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets and were $ 5,091 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 5,579 million at December 31, 2020. Our lease liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $ 4,991 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 5,469 million at December 31, 2020. The weighted average discount rate used to measure lease liabilities was approximately 3.5 % at December 31, 2021 and 3.6 % at December 31, 2020.

During 2020, we reevaluated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believed most significantly affected the air travel, commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges pertained to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), one of the largest businesses within Berkshire’s manufacturing segment. The carrying values of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges were approximately $ 31 billion. The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflected our assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts. K-89 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (13) Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) The gross carrying amounts and related accumulated amortization of other intangible assets are summarized as follows (in millions).

Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2022 – $ 1,189 ; 2023 – $ 1,120 ; 2024 – $ 1,023 ; 2025 – $ 939 and 2026 – $ 846 . Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $ 18.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. ( 14 ) Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 is presented in the following table (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Cash paid during the year for: Income taxes $ 5,412 $ 5,001 $ 5,415 Interest: Insurance and other 1,227 1,001 1,011 Railroad, utilities and energy 3,162 3,006 2,879 Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions 102 6,981 766 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 687 729 782 ( 15 ) Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $ 30 billion as ordinary dividends during 2022. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $ 6.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 5.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $ 301 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 237 billion at December 31, 2020. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes. K-90 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 6 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 is as follows (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 79,854 $ 73,019 $ 68,458 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,912 ) ( 2,855 ) ( 3,060 ) Net liabilities 76,942 70,164 65,398 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 52,099 43,400 43,335 Prior accident years ( 3,116 ) ( 356 ) ( 752 ) Total 48,983 43,044 42,583 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 22,897 ) ( 17,884 ) ( 19,482 ) Prior accident years ( 18,904 ) ( 18,862 ) ( 17,642 ) Total ( 41,801 ) ( 36,746 ) ( 37,124 ) Foreign currency effect ( 420 ) 480 ( 23 ) Business acquisition (disposition) — — ( 670 ) Balances at December 31: Net liabilities 83,704 76,942 70,164 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,960 2,912 2,855 Gross liabilities $ 86,664 $ 79,854 $ 73,019 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses included approximately $ 2.9 billion in 2021, $ 950 million in 2020 and $ 1.0 billion in 2019 from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $ 100 million per event) occurring in the respective year. Current accident year incurred losses from private passenger auto insurance also increased significantly in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased claims frequencies and severities. In 2020, current accident year incurred losses reflected low private passenger auto claims frequencies and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurance business attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 3.1 billion in 2021, $ 356 million in 2020 and $ 752 million in 2019, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 4.0 % in 2021, 0.5 % in 2020 and 1.1 % in 2019. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $ 2.4 billion in 2021, $ 518 million in 2020 and $ 457 million in 2019. The reductions in 2021 and 2020 derived primarily from private passenger auto and medical professional liability claims. In both 2021 and 2020, we also lowered estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years with respect to workers’ compensation claims, which were largely offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2019 reflected reductions in medical professional liability and workers’ compensation estimates partially offset by higher other casualty estimates. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $ 718 million in 2021, increased $ 162 million in 2020 and decreased $ 295 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 included increased claims estimates for legacy casualty exposures. K-91 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 6 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures were approximately $ 2.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims. Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The effects of businesses acquired or disposed during the year are reflected in the data presented on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2021 follows (in millions). GEICO Physical Damage GEICO Auto Liability BH Primary Medical Professional Liability BH Primary Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty BHRG Property BHRG Casualty Total Unpaid losses and ALAE, net $ 729 $ 19,768 $ 8,506 $ 13,579 $ 13,119 $ 23,611 $ 79,312 Reinsurance recoverable 11 1,085 28 639 181 892 2,836 Unpaid unallocated loss adjustment expenses 2,448 Other unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,068 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 86,664 GEICO GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K-92 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 6 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all auto policy coverages. Dollars are in millions.

Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent developments based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

These methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates. K-95 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 6 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Dollars are in millions.

Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021 follow (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Balances at beginning of year $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts 153 ( 17 ) — — 1,138 ( 453 ) Prior years’ contracts ( 974 ) 1,819 ( 399 ) 1,306 378 810 Total ( 821 ) 1,802 ( 399 ) 1,306 1,516 357 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,889 ) — ( 1,076 ) — ( 909 ) — Balances at December 31 $ 38,256 $ ( 10,639 ) $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 981 $ 907 $ 1,873 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposures to losses began. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities have little or no practical analytical value. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 15.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 17.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Claim payments under this contract commenced in 2021 and were $ 1.2 billion during 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 5.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $ 845 million in 2021, $ 907 million in 2020 and $ 1,188 million in 2019, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes. Estimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $ 12.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.

In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $ 600 million of maturing debt and issued ¥ 128.5 billion (approximately $ 1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In 2021, BHFC repaid $ 750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 750 million of 2.5 % senior notes due in 2051 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.9 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 785.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 1.3 billion in 2021, pre-tax losses of $ 1.0 billion in 2020 and pre-tax gains of $ 192 million in 2019. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 3.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average December 31, Interest Rate 2021 2020 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2051 4.3 % $ 13,003 $ 13,447 Subsidiary and other debt due 2022 - 2064 4.1 % 36,759 36,420 Short-term borrowings 1.4 % 2,009 2,286 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) and subsidiaries due 2022 - 2097 4.5 % 23,219 23,220 $ 74,990 $ 75,373 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $ 2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2 % and repaid $ 2.5 billion of term debt. K-99 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 8 ) Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During 2021, BNSF issued $ 1.55 billion of term debt with maturity dates in 2051 and 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1 % and repaid debt of $ 1.54 billion. As of December 31, 2021, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 10.4 billion at December 31, 2021, which included approximately $ 8.7 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes. K-100 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (19) Income taxes (Continued) Income tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 was as follows (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Federal $ 20,345 $ 10,596 $ 19,069 State ( 527 ) 1,086 625 Foreign 1,061 758 1,210 $ 20,879 $ 12,440 $ 20,904 Current $ 5,326 $ 5,052 $ 5,818 Deferred 15,553 7,388 15,086 $ 20,879 $ 12,440 $ 20,904 Income tax expense is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 in the table below (in millions). 2021 2020 2019 Earnings before income taxes $ 111,686 $ 55,693 $ 102,696 Hypothetical income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ 23,454 $ 11,696 $ 21,566 Dividends received deduction and tax-exempt interest ( 457 ) ( 448 ) ( 433 ) State income taxes, less U.S. federal income tax benefit ( 417 ) 858 494 U.S. income tax credits ( 1,860 ) ( 1,519 ) ( 942 ) Goodwill impairments — 1,977 20 Other differences, net 159 ( 124 ) 199 $ 20,879 $ 12,440 $ 20,904 Effective income tax rate 18.7 % 22.3 % 20.4 % We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011 . The U.S. federal income tax returns from 2012 through 2019 remain open, and tax years 2014 through 2019 are under audit. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2022 . We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, net unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1,046 million and $ 1,113 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2021, were $ 878 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. Other differences, net included expense of $ 60 million in 2020 and $ 377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018 . We concluded it was more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. We do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2022. K-101 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) ( 2 0 ) Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

K-102 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) ( 2 0 ) Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

We currently consider the related fair value measurements to contain Level 3 inputs. See Note 4 for information regarding these investments. Quantitative information as of December 31, 2021 for assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. (2 1 ) Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the three years ending December 31, 2021 are shown in the table below.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. K-104 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (22) Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues. 2021 Manufacturing McLane Service and retailing BNSF Berkshire Hathaway Energy Insurance, Corporate and other Total Manufactured products: Industrial and commercial products $ 22,184 $ — $ 159 $ — $ — $ — $ 22,343 Building products 19,604 — — — — — 19,604 Consumer products 18,540 — — — — — 18,540 Grocery and convenience store distribution — 31,245 — — — — 31,245 Food and beverage distribution — 17,332 — — — — 17,332 Auto sales — — 9,966 — — — 9,966 Other retail and wholesale distribution 2,997 — 15,898 — — — 18,895 Service 1,486 751 4,123 23,120 5,583 — 35,063 Electricity and natural gas — — — — 18,264 — 18,264 Total 64,811 49,328 30,146 23,120 23,847 — 191,252 Other revenues 3,766 122 4,601 57 1,096 75,200 84,842 $ 68,577 $ 49,450 $ 34,747 $ 23,177 $ 24,943 $ 75,200 $ 276,094 2020 Manufactured products: Industrial and commercial products $ 20,772 $ — $ 192 $ — $ — $ — $ 20,964 Building products 15,943 — — — — — 15,943 Consumer products 14,757 — — — — — 14,757 Grocery and convenience store distribution — 30,795 — — — — 30,795 Food and beverage distribution — 15,368 — — — — 15,368 Auto sales — — 8,258 — — — 8,258 Other retail and wholesale distribution 2,452 — 12,470 — — — 14,922 Service 1,456 584 3,332 20,693 4,595 — 30,660 Electricity and natural gas — — — — 15,066 — 15,066 Total 55,380 46,747 24,252 20,693 19,661 — 166,733 Other revenues 3,598 93 3,859 57 1,353 69,817 78,777 $ 58,978 $ 46,840 $ 28,111 $ 20,750 $ 21,014 $ 69,817 $ 245,510 2019 Manufactured products: Industrial and commercial products $ 25,311 $ — $ 184 $ — $ — $ — $ 25,495 Building products 15,620 — — — — — 15,620 Consumer products 14,120 — — — — — 14,120 Grocery and convenience store distribution — 33,057 — — — — 33,057 Food and beverage distribution — 16,767 — — — — 16,767 Auto sales — — 8,481 — — — 8,481 Other retail and wholesale distribution 2,299 — 12,213 — — — 14,512 Service 1,642 539 4,062 23,302 4,096 — 33,641 Electricity and natural gas — — — — 14,819 — 14,819 Total 58,992 50,363 24,940 23,302 18,915 — 176,512 Other revenues 3,632 95 4,459 55 1,181 68,682 78,104 $ 62,624 $ 50,458 $ 29,399 $ 23,357 $ 20,096 $ 68,682 $ 254,616 K-105 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 2 ) Revenues from contracts with customers (Continued) A summary of the transaction price allocated to the significant unsatisfied remaining performance obligations relating to contracts with expected durations in excess of one year as of December 31, 2021 and the timing of when the performance obligations are expected to be satisfied follows (in millions).

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.

We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts. Berkshire’s operating segments are as follows.

Sales, service and leasing revenues attributable to the United States were 85 % in 2021, 86 % in 2020 and 85 % in 2019 of such amounts. The remainder of sales, service and leasing revenues were primarily in Europe, Canada and the Asia Pacific region. Railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $ 48.1 billion in 2021, $ 41.8 billion in 2020 and $ 43.5 billion in 2019. In each of the three years, approximately 96 % of such revenues were attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2021, approximately 89 % of our consolidated net property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease was located in the United States with the remainder primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom. (2 6 ) Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods and services used in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business. As of December 31, 2021, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $ 8 billion in 2022, $ 4 billion in 2023, $ 3 billion in 2024, $ 2 billion in 2025, $ 2 billion in 2026 and $ 15 billion after 2026. As indicated in Note 5, we have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4 % ownership interest in Pilot in 2023. At that time, Pilot will become a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, we may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. If we had acquired the additional interest in Pilot and all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2021, we estimate the aggregate cost of these acquisitions would approximate $ 11 billion. K-112 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None Item 9A. Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.

Business Description Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a large number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 360,000 people worldwide at the end of 2020. Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses establish specific policies and practices for their businesses concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Such policies and practices generally address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment for employees, customers and other business partners, offering competitive compensation to employees, including health insurance and retirement benefits and incentives, providing learning and career development opportunities, and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce. Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance entities. Berkshire’s insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty and life, accident and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed approximately 51,000 people at the end of 2020. In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. K-1 Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing various regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. For example, the U.S. state regulators now require insurance groups to file an annual report, called an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead regulator. U.S. state regulators formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead group wide supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including a group capital calculation tool and various liquidity assessments, that could be imposed on insurance groups in the future. Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $237 billion at December 31, 2020. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the “2019 TRIA Reauthorization”). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in 2020, or any calendar year thereafter. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. K-2 During 20 20 and thereafter , in the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 8 0 % of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2021 for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to approximate $ 1.4 billion . There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year . The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example: • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports; • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer; • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer's use of local and offshore reinsurance vary; • policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country; • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; • the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary significantly by country; and • regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country. Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach. Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in other countries, including Canada, various members of the European Union (“EU”), Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau and Dubai. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the EU (“Brexit”), which resulted in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the UK leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the EU following Brexit. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU as a result of Brexit, Berkshire expects to continue to maintain a substantial presence in London. Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows. GEICO —GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. K-3 The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 3 6 % over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 201 9 , the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 201 9 of approximately 5 8 % based on written premiums , with GEICO’s market share being second largest at approximately 13. 8 %. Since that data was published , GEICO’s management estimates its current market share may have declined, depending on how the effects of pandemic-related premium credit programs will be reflected in A.M. Best’s measurements . Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group —The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below. NICO and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner’s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess policies on an admitted and surplus basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several U.S. cities. BH Specialty also maintains international offices located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

USLI markets policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide workers’ compensation, business owners’, commercial auto, commercial package and homeowners’ products to over 350,000 small and mid-sized businesses.

GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Central States Indemnity Company of Omaha, based in Omaha, Nebraska, primarily writes credit card credit insurance, Medicare Supplement insurance and agricultural equipment insurance. On October 1, 2018, NICO acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”). MLMIC has been the leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes its policies mostly on a K-4 direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. In October 2019, Berkshire sold its 81% interest in Applied Underwriters, Inc. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group —Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. Reinsurance business is written through National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, its subsidiaries and various other insurance subsidiaries wholly owned by Berkshire (collectively, the “NICO Group”) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. BHRG also conducts business activities globally in 23 countries. The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. Property/casualty The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks for clients worldwide. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries. The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG (“GRAG”), based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in 22 countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. Life/health The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Approximately 35% of the aggregate life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group were in the Asia Pacific compared to 26% in the United States, 22% in Western Europe and 17% throughout the rest of the world. Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures. BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts. K-5 Retroactive reinsurance NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. For instance, an excess contract written in January 2017 provides indemnification for 80% of up to $25 billion in excess of $25 billion retained by the ceding company. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. Periodic payment annuity BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies, generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in establishing annuity premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. Investments of insurance businesses —Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $88 billion at the end of 2015 to approximately $138 billion at the end of 2020. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In four of the past five years, Berkshire’s cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains. Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa Fe Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000 employees at the end of 2020. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business. In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December 31, 2020, approximately 37% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 26% from industrial products, 24% from agricultural products and 13% from coal. K-6 Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business. The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. Environmental Matters BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.

Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. BHE Renewables, based in Iowa, owns interests in independent power projects having approximately 4,700 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Hawaii and the Philippines. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, BHE Renewables has invested over $6 billion in 32 wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. K-8 Regulatory Matters PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission and distribution-only services. Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023. AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service, (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. Environmental Matters BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. K-9 Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force November 4, 2016. The United States completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 21, 2021, and the United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. The EPA’s repeal and replacement of the Clean Power Plan is not expected to have a material impact on BHE and its energy subsidiaries. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy. BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, through December 31, 2020, BHE’s cumulative investment in wind, solar, geothermal and biomass generation is approximately $34 billion. Non-Energy Businesses HomeServices of America, Inc.

Information concerning the major activities of these three groups follows. Berkshire’s manufacturing businesses employed approximately 179,000 people at the end of 2020. K-10 Industrial products Precision Castparts Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (“IGT”) and nuclear power plants; downhole casing and tubing, fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil and gas environments; investment castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries; revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications. Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines. PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and gas markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non-aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titanium products are used to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and other industrial end markets. PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets. PCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). The majority of PCC’s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. In 2020, delay requests increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking at extraordinary rates. Aircraft build rates have not yet begun to recover in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCC significantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% since the end of 2019 to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. The restructuring actions taken began to improve margins in late 2020 from the low margins experienced earlier in the year and further margin improvements are expected going forward. PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.

Substantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester. In the tufting process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic backing, forming loops, which may be cut or left uncut, depending on the desired texture or construction. During 2020, Shaw processed approximately 97% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers. The soft floor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of key players domestically where the majority of Shaw’s business occurs. There are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in hard surface floor covering production, distribution and sales. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 44% of the total United States consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality, style, price and service.

Management currently believes there are readily available alternative sources of raw materials and yarn. However, if relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources of supply, production could be adversely affected, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on results of operations. Additionally, raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. FOL has secured contracts to purchase cotton, either directly or through the yarn suppliers, to meet a large percentage of its production plans for 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway Automotive The Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Group, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 104 new vehicle franchises through 81 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 29 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company. Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 70% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. K-20 Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law. BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Risk Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. General Business Risks Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses. A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. Cyber security risks We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. K-22 Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and /or liquidity. Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 90, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 97. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions. We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value. We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings. Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits. Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts, which contain equity price risks. Most of the contracts remaining at year end 2020 will expire by February 2023. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payments upon contract expirations. K-23 Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. Risks unique to our regulated businesses Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently, we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period. K-24 The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses. The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($120.8 billion at December 31, 2020), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; transacting between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. K-25 Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and /or capital resources of these businesses. Item 1B.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated beginning in the second half of March, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter due to closures of facilities where crowds gather, such as retail stores, restaurants and entertainment venues as well as from public travel restrictions and from closures of certain of our businesses. In each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, several of these businesses experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings as compared to the second quarter. Our businesses that were deemed essential continued to operate through the pandemic, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses. In response to the effects of the pandemic, our businesses implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. Our businesses also implemented practices to protect employees while at work. Such practices included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of workspaces, providing employee health screenings, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing general health reminders intended to lower the risk of spreading COVID-19. We also took actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we offer and our temporary inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions included employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. Certain of our businesses undertook and may continue to undertake restructuring activities to resize their operations to better fit expected customer demand. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at all of our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $657 million in 2020, $325 million in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $750 million in 2020, $800 million in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2018. Underwriting results in 2020 also reflected the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2020 declined $491 million (8.9%) versus 2019, reflecting lower interest income primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, attributable to increases in interest and dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business decreased 5.8% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.8% as compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings in 2020 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined 11.4% versus 2019. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic varied among our manufacturing businesses relative to significance and duration. Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $11.0 billion in 2020, $435 million in 2019 and $3.0 billion in 2018. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2020 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate losses of $764 million related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather in the first half of 2019. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018, reflecting mixed operating results with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs. Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented included significant gains and losses on our investments in equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on securities we continue to hold. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Underwriting results in 2020 of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic in the future may be further affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 3,428 $ 1,506 $ 2,449 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 110 383 670 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (2,700 ) (1,472 ) (1,109 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 838 417 2,010 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 181 92 444 Net underwriting earnings $ 657 $ 325 $ 1,566 Effective income tax rate 21.5 % 24.2 % 21.4 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 34,928 $ 36,016 $ 34,123 Premiums earned $ 35,093 100.0 $ 35,572 100.0 $ 33,363 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 26,018 74.1 28,937 81.3 26,278 78.8 Underwriting expenses 5,647 16.1 5,129 14.5 4,636 13.9 Total losses and expenses 31,665 90.2 34,066 95.8 30,914 92.7 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 3,428 $ 1,506 $ 2,449 2020 versus 2019 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for 2020 reflected significant declines in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic offset by the effects of the GEICO Giveback program (see following paragraph) on earned premiums. Premiums written decreased 3.0% compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies written during the same period. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written in 2020 by approximately $2.9 billion. Premiums earned decreased 1.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, which included reductions of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Voluntary auto policies-in-force at the end of 2020 increased approximately 820,000 (4.6%) compared to the end of 2019. The increase reflected a 7.3% decrease in new business sales and a 2.5% decrease in non-renewals and policy cancellations. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program. 2019 versus 2018 Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4%, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales and a decrease in policies cancelled or not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% compared to 2018. The loss ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018, primarily due to increases in average claims severities. Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range). Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net increases of $42 million in 2019 and net of decreases $222 million in 2018 for changes in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events. Underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2019 was 14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. K-36 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,212 $ 9,843 $ 8,561 Premiums earned $ 9,615 100.0 $ 9,165 100.0 $ 8,111 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 7,129 74.1 6,336 69.1 5,261 64.9 Underwriting expenses 2,376 24.7 2,446 26.7 2,180 26.9 Total losses and expenses 9,505 98.8 8,782 95.8 7,441 91.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 110 $ 383 $ 670 Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers. The increase at BH Specialty was driven by increased casualty business globally and the increase at MedPro Group reflected increases across several product categories. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. The declines in workers’ compensation and commercial auto business written reflected the effects of reduced exposures and premium refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic and volume reductions attributable to increased price competition in the market. Premiums written increased $1.3 billion (15.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to higher volumes from BH Specialty, MedPro Group and GUARD, as well as from the effects of the MLMIC acquisition. These increases were partly offset by lower volume at BHHC and the effect of the Applied Underwriters divestiture. BH Primary’s combined loss ratios were 74.1% in 2020, 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018, which reflected the effects of significant catastrophe events during the year and changes in estimated losses for prior years’ loss events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $207 million in 2020 (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires) and $190 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California). We incurred no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Losses in 2020 also included $167 million attributable to the pandemic. Finally, losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $265 million in 2020, $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. K-37 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The increase was primarily attributable to new business, including a small number of contracts with very large premiums, and increased participations on renewals. Premiums written in 2019 increased $1.0 billion (10.8%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations on renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.6 billion (35.3%). The loss ratio in 2020 was 81.0%, an increase of 7.2 percentage points over 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 included estimated losses of $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated losses from significant catastrophe events of $667 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also reflected net increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $162 million in 2020 primarily attributable to legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims. Such amount as a percentage of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of 2020 was 0.5%. BHRG’s loss ratio was 73.8% in 2019 and 77.6% in 2018. Losses in 2019 included approximately $1.0 billion from Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, while losses in 2018 included approximately $1.3 billion from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net decreases of $295 million in 2019 and $469 million in 2018 for prior years’ loss events. Such amounts as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2018. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $533 million (20.6%) over 2019, and underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $376 million (17.0%) over 2018. The increases reflected the increases in premium volumes and changes in business mix. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 5,848 $ 4,963 $ 5,430 Premiums earned $ 5,861 100.0 $ 4,869 100.0 $ 5,327 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 4,883 83.3 3,800 78.0 4,240 79.6 Underwriting expenses 996 17.0 910 18.7 905 17.0 Total benefits and expenses 5,879 100.3 4,710 96.7 5,145 96.6 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (18 ) $ 159 $ 182 Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to a reinsurance contract covering U.S. health insurance risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was not renewed for 2021. The remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in the Asian and European life reinsurance markets. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims (approximately $275 million) and continuing losses from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions with respect to disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. The ratio of life and health insurance benefits to premiums earned was 83.3% in 2020 and 81.5% in 2019, which is before the effects of the BHLN contract amendment referred to below. Life/health premiums written in 2019 decreased $467 million (8.6%) compared to 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract in 2019 of $49 million, while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. In 2019, premiums earned also included $228 million from a new health reinsurance contract and reflected volume growth in life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar. Underwriting earnings in 2019 included a one-time gain of $163 million attributable to the BHLN yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions increased U.S. long-term care liabilities due to discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2020. Premiums written were $684 million in 2019 and $517 million in 2018, attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019 and pre-tax gains of $169 million in 2018. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $1.1 billion in 2020, $1.2 billion in 2019 and $947 million in 2018. Overall, we decreased estimated ultimate liabilities $399 million in 2020 for prior years’ contracts compared to an increase of $378 million in 2019. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $230 million in 2020 and pre-tax losses of $125 million in 2019. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. K-39 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2020 decreased $297 million (34.4%) compared to 2019, which decreased $293 million (25.3%) from 2018. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of $93 million in 2018. Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $550 million in 2020, $509 million in 2019 and $433 million in 2018. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as from the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate was approximately 4.0%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020 compared to pre-tax earnings of $167 million in 2019 and $34 million in 2018. The results of this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits reinsured, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Interest and other investment income $ 1,059 $ 2,075 $ 1,851 (49.0 )% 12.1 % Dividend income 4,890 4,525 3,652 8.1 23.9 Pre-tax net investment income 5,949 6,600 5,503 (9.9 ) 19.9 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 910 1,070 949 Net investment income $ 5,039 $ 5,530 $ 4,554 Effective income tax rate 15.3 % 16.1 % 17.2 % Interest and other investment income declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and the decline continued throughout 2020, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. We expect such rates, which are historically low, to remain low, negatively affecting our earnings from such investments in 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments. Interest and other investment income increased $224 million (12.1%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset by lower income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income increased $873 million (23.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels, including the investment in Occidental and increased dividends from common stock investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $138 billion at December 31, 2020, $129 billion at December 31, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $838 million in 2020, $417 million in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions).

K-41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major railroad business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Railroad operating revenues $ 20,181 $ 22,745 $ 22,999 (11.3 )% (1.1 )% Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 4,542 5,270 5,322 (13.8 ) (1.0 ) Fuel 1,789 2,944 3,346 (39.2 ) (12.0 ) Purchased services 1,954 2,049 2,131 (4.6 ) (3.8 ) Depreciation and amortization 2,460 2,389 2,306 3.0 3.6 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,684 2,028 2,110 (17.0 ) (3.9 ) Total 12,429 14,680 15,215 (15.3 ) (3.5 ) Railroad operating earnings 7,752 8,065 7,784 (3.9 ) 3.6 Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 688 770 856 (10.6 ) (10.0 ) Other expenses, net (611 ) (515 ) (736 ) 18.6 (30.0 ) Interest expense (1,037 ) (1,070 ) (1,041 ) (3.1 ) 2.8 Pre-tax earnings 6,792 7,250 6,863 (6.3 ) 5.6 Income taxes 1,631 1,769 1,644 (7.8 ) 7.6 Net earnings $ 5,161 $ 5,481 $ 5,219 (5.8 ) 5.0 Effective income tax rate 24.0 % 24.4 % 24.0 % The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Consumer products 5,266 5,342 5,597 (1.4 )% (4.6 )% Industrial products 1,622 1,931 1,991 (16.0 ) (3.0 ) Agricultural products 1,189 1,146 1,208 3.8 (5.1 ) Coal 1,404 1,802 1,902 (22.1 ) (5.3 ) Total cars/units 9,481 10,221 10,698 (7.2 ) (4.5 ) 2020 versus 2019 Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of the year. Volumes sequentially improved from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. BNSF is an important component of the national and global supply chain and, as an essential business, has continued to operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. The pandemic continues to evolve, and the full extent to which it may impact BNSF's business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments. We believe BNSF's fundamental business remains strong and it has ample liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019. Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half of 2020. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which drove lower sand and petroleum products volume, along with reduced steel demand, which drove lower taconite volume. Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain and meal exports, partially offsetting adverse impacts of the pandemic, primarily for ethanol and sweeteners shipments. Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures. Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and due to improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses. 2019 versus 2018 Railroad operating revenues were $22.7 billion in 2019, a decline of 1.1% versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an increase in average revenue per car/unit, earnings in 2019 benefited from a reduction in total operating expenses. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Operating revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting volume decreases and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports. Operating revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes and reduced car loadings, due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Increased demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the other decreases in volumes. Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower volumes and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies and the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Operating revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018, reflecting lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volumes. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the effects of lower natural gas prices. Railroad operating expenses were $14.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $535 million compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in 2019 of 64.5% decreased 1.7 percentage points versus 2018. Operating expenses in 2019 reflected lower volume-related costs, lower fuel prices and the effects of cost control initiatives, partially offset by the costs associated with the adverse weather conditions. Fuel expenses decreased $402 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense and higher insurance recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018, due to lower locomotive and various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls. Other expenses, net decreased $221 million compared to 2018. In 2019, other expenses were net of a $120 million curtailment gain from an amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility in which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of these systems were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S acquisition”). See Note 2 to accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 15,556 $ 15,371 $ 15,573 Real estate operating revenue 5,396 4,473 4,214 Other income (loss) 79 270 200 Total revenue 21,031 20,114 19,987 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 4,187 4,586 4,769 Energy operating expense 7,539 6,824 6,969 Real estate operating costs and expense 4,885 4,251 4,000 Interest expense 1,941 1,835 1,777 Total costs and expense 18,552 17,496 17,515 Pre-tax earnings 2,479 2,618 2,472 Income tax expense (benefit)* (1,010 ) (526 ) (452 ) Net earnings after income taxes 3,489 3,144 2,924 Noncontrolling interests 71 18 23 Net earnings attributable to BHE 3,418 3,126 2,901 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 327 286 280 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 3,091 $ 2,840 $ 2,621 Effective income tax rate (40.7 )% (20.1 )% (18.3 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generat ion.

PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service, higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower operating revenue from a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to $73 million of earnings from the BHE GT&S acquisition, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses. Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units. K-46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits. 2019 versus 2018 PacifiCorp after-tax earnings were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million compared to 2018, reflecting slightly higher utility margin and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as a 0.4% increase in retail customer volumes was largely offset by lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes. MEC after-tax earnings of $781 million in 2019 increased $112 million as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increases in electric utility margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking and other income. Electric utility margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes of 1.4%, as a 4.0% increase in industrial volumes was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impacts of weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service (net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense. NV Energy after-tax earnings were $365 million in 2019, an increase of $48 million compared to 2018, as lower operating expenses were partly offset by lower electric utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable to the impacts of weather, and rate reductions from the impact of the changes in U.S. income tax laws, partially offset by retail customer growth. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar. Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable to higher tariff rates, partly offset by lower distributed units. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $35 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from increased spending on capital projects. Other energy businesses after-tax earnings in 2019 increased $119 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments and $25 million from new and existing projects and activities), higher income from geothermal and natural gas units, largely due to higher generation and favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business acquisitions, partially offset by lower earnings at brokerage businesses, primarily from a decrease in closed units and lower margins. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings decline was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the changes in U.S. income tax laws, higher interest expense and lower earnings from non-regulated energy services. K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).

The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $783 million in 2020, $788 million in 2019 and $932 million in 2018. In 2020, such expenses also exclude after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.4 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-33 and in the “Other” earnings section on page K-56. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Revenues Industrial products $ 25,667 $ 30,594 $ 30,679 (16.1 )% (0.3 )% Building products 21,244 20,327 18,677 4.5 8.8 Consumer products 12,168 11,809 12,527 3.0 (5.7 ) $ 59,079 $ 62,730 $ 61,883 Pretax earnings Industrial products $ 3,755 $ 5,635 $ 5,822 (33.4 )% (3.2 )% Building products 2,858 2,636 2,336 8.4 12.8 Consumer products 1,397 1,251 1,208 11.7 3.6 $ 8,010 $ 9,522 $ 9,366 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 14.6 % 18.4 % 19.0 % Building products 13.5 % 13.0 % 12.5 % Consumer products 11.5 % 10.6 % 9.6 % K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019. PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. Historically, a significant portion of PCC’s earnings have been dependent on sales related to the aerospace industry. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. In 2020, PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2%, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were $650 million, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects of the pandemic, PCC has taken aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% since the end of 2019. PCC recorded charges for restructuring and inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Although earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates, the restructuring actions taken contributed to improved margins in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the year and further margin improvements are expected in the future. The level of aircraft production is currently expected to slowly increase beginning in the latter half of 2021. However, this is dependent of the timing and extent that COVID-19 infections are lowered on a sustained basis and the return to historical levels of air travel and subsequent demand for aerospace products. Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019, due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. Overall, the effects of the pandemic on Lubrizol were more pronounced in the first half of the year, as volumes rebounded significantly in the second half. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire. Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all sectors, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies sectors. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services sector and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) as compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in revenues, increased restructuring charges and lower interest income. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales mix. 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the industrial products group were slightly lower in 2019 than in 2018 and pre-tax earnings declined 3.2% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018. PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. In 2019, PCC generated increased sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets. The increase in aerospace sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs, such as LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries and sales. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting increased sales of aerospace products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the power markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC incurred incremental costs in 2019 to meet required deliveries to customers associated with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace products. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of 5.2% compared to 2018. The decline reflected lower volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019 declined 4% from 2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire. Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins. Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of lower metal prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container leasing revenue and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2019 (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased earnings in sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal Services and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other expenses. IMC’s revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues from recent business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 2020 versus 2019 Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage services, insurance and interest income from lending activities increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, partly attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs. 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the building products group in 2019 increased $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018, while pre-tax earnings increased 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.0% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2018. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The comparative increase was primarily due to a 26% increase in home sales, reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while average prices declined 5%. Manufactured home unit retail sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest income from lending activities increased 6.7% in 2019 compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to home building activities, which benefitted from the increases in home sales, and to financial services activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to higher average loan balances, increased earnings from other financial services and lower credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018. Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities closure costs. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). 2020 versus 2019 Consumer products revenues increased of $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%. The comparative increase in revenues reflected revenue increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility. The comparative increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts. 2019 versus 2018 Consumer products revenues declined $718 million (5.7%) in 2019 versus 2018, driven by a 12.9% revenue decline from Forest River, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and footwear revenues declined 1.1% compared to 2018. Although revenues from Brooks Sports increased 3.5% in 2019, its operating results were negatively affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in the second quarter. In addition, our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for certain products, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $43 million (3.6%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch, partially offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River. K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Percentage change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs 2019 2019 vs 2018 Revenues Service $ 12,346 $ 13,496 $ 13,333 (8.5 )% 1.2 % Retailing 15,832 15,991 15,606 (1.0 ) 2.5 McLane Company 46,840 50,458 49,987 (7.2 ) 0.9 $ 75,018 $ 79,945 $ 78,926 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 1,600 $ 1,681 $ 1,836 (4.8 )% (8.4 )% Retailing 1,028 874 860 17.6 1.6 McLane Company 251 288 246 (12.8 ) 17.1 $ 2,879 $ 2,843 $ 2,942 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 13.0 % 12.5 % 13.8 % Retailing 6.5 % 5.5 % 5.5 % McLane Company 0.5 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Service Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 2020 versus 2019 Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020 compared to 12.5% in 2019. The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline was also attributable to the effects of the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic. Partially offsetting these declines were revenue increases at TTI and at WPLG. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and from the effects of the divestiture of the newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) 2019 versus 2018 Service group revenues increased $163 million (1.2%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increased sales at TTI and higher aviation-related services revenues (NetJets and FlightSafety), partially offset by decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage. TTI’s sales increased 2% in 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. TTI’s sales slowed throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower average selling prices and the effects of U.S. trade tariffs. The increase in NetJets’ revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft on lease, and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards. The revenue decline at Charter Brokerage was attributable to the divesture of a high revenue, low margin business in mid-2019. Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. The comparative earnings decline was primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets. TTI’s earnings decline was primarily attributable to lower gross margins, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses. The earnings decline at FlightSafety was attributable to pre-tax losses of approximately $165 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with an existing government contract, partly offset by lower training equipment impairment charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products and represented 62.6% of our combined retailing revenue in 2020. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented 20.6% of the combined retailing revenues in 2020. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 2020 versus 2019 Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations. BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6% as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels. The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions, and from lower advertising and other operating expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of the pandemic. 2019 versus 2018 Retailing group revenues increased $385 million (2.5%) in 2019 compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues increased 4.1% in 2019 over 2018, primarily attributable to an 11.5% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in vehicle finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. Home furnishings group revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 compared to 2018, as sales were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations. Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $14 million (1.6%) in 2019 over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 22.7%, primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally higher operating expenses. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2020 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 2020 versus 2019 Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19 related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect that these operating conditions will continue. 2019 versus 2018 Revenues increased $471 million (0.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. McLane’s results in 2019 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2018. Otherwise, revenues decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business and increased 3% in the foodservice business in 2019 as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which was employee costs. K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Investment gains (losses) $ 40,905 $ 71,123 $ (22,155 ) Derivative gains (losses) (159 ) 1,484 (300 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 40,746 72,607 (22,455 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 9,155 15,162 (4,718 ) Net gains (losses) $ 31,591 $ 57,445 $ (17,737 ) Effective income tax rate 21.7 % 20.9 % 20.8 % Investment gains (losses) We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at December 31, 2020 and net losses of approximately $14.0 billion from changes in market prices during 2020 on securities sold during 2020. We recorded pre-tax unrealized investment gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices in 2019 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2019. Pre-tax unrealized investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion were recorded in 2018 attributable to market price changes in 2018 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $6.2 billion in 2020, $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains (losses) Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $727 million and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $1.1 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax losses of $159 million in 2020, pre-tax gains of $1.5 billion in 2019 and pre-tax losses of $300 million in 2018. These gains and losses reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties were relatively insignificant in each of the three years. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Equity method earnings (losses) $ 665 $ 1,023 $ (1,419 ) Acquisition accounting expenses (783 ) (788 ) (831 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments (10,381 ) (96 ) (280 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (334 ) (280 ) (311 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (764 ) 58 289 Income tax expense adjustments (60 ) (377 ) — Other, principally corporate investment income 339 884 986 $ (11,318 ) $ 424 $ (1,566 ) K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other (Continued) After-tax equity method earnings (losses) include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $170 million in 2020 and $488 million in 2019 and our after-tax losses were $1,859 million in 2018. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such charges was $611 million in 2020, $339 million in 2019 and approximately $2.7 billion in 2018. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Critical Accounting Policies on page K-63 for additional details. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥625.5 billion par), and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion par). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustments relate to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018, we first learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds. In January 2020, the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the previously recognized income tax benefits were not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $443.2 billion, an increase of $18.4 billion since December 31, 2019, which was net of common stock repurchases of $24.7 billion. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $42.5 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $31.7 billion. During each of the last three years, changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our earnings. Our results in 2020 also included after-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairments charges of $11.0 billion. At December 31, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $135.0 billion, which included $112.8 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $301.6 billion. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $22.7 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025. Berkshire also issued ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion) with a weighted average interest rate of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.7 billion will mature, including $665 million (€550 million) that matured in January. In January 2021, Berkshire issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $18.9 billion at December 31, 2020, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In 2020, BHFC repaid $900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $3.0 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2030 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In January 2021, $750 million of BHFC debt matured and BHFC issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations were $9.8 billion in 2020 and we forecast a similar amount of capital expenditures in 2021. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.2 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $9.6 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and repaid approximately $3.2 billion of debt. BHE also assumed $5.6 billion in debt in connection with the business acquired from Dominion Energy in November 2020. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program as amended permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2020, Berkshire paid $24.7 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table. Estimated payments due by period Total 2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 After 2025 Notes payable and other borrowings, including interest $ 182,004 $ 13,456 $ 23,393 $ 19,596 $ 125,559 Operating leases 6,318 1,342 2,016 1,269 1,691 Purchase obligations (1) 48,413 14,552 7,947 5,939 19,975 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) 120,820 27,617 28,623 16,144 48,436 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) 36,920 2,623 269 540 33,488 Other 26,524 3,136 7,762 1,684 13,942 Total $ 420,999 $ 62,726 $ 70,010 $ 45,172 $ 243,091 (1) Primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. (2) Includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2020 follows. Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include liabilities for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $120.8 billion (including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance), of which 83% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2020, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $22.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $21.8 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2020, case development liabilities averaged approximately 33% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2019 were reduced by $253 million during 2020, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2020 reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2020. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $300 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 5,714 $ 9,497 $ 15,211 IBNR liabilities 5,821 14,615 20,436 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 11,535 24,112 35,647 Reinsurance recoverable 181 864 1,045 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 11,354 $ 23,248 $ 34,602 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts and is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2020, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $800 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional Analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2020, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $160 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, the overall change in estimates for prior years’ events was not significant in 2020. However, the potential for significant changes in future periods remains. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts increased $468 million in 2020, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2020, gross unpaid losses were $41.0 billion and deferred charge assets were $12.4 billion. Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million. In 2020, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts. K-62 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2020, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2021 will approximate $1.1 billion. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2020. We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of goodwill related to PCC was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC’s indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers is particularly severe. We considered a number of factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers on reduced aircraft production, and the actions we are taking or may take to restructure our operations to fit lower expected demand. In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines and vaccines that effectively treat the virus. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead us to record additional goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2021. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. K-63 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. Our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Prices Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Earnings (1) December 31, 2020 Investments in equity securities $ 281,170 30% increase $ 362,830 $ 63,321 30% decrease 199,547 (63,293 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 1,065 30% increase 257 638 30% decrease 2,702 (1,293 ) December 31, 2019 Investments in equity securities $ 248,027 30% increase $ 319,445 $ 56,493 30% decrease 176,749 (56,382 ) Equity index put option contract liabilities 968 30% increase 267 554 30% decrease 2,776 (1,428 ) (1) The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. K-64 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Market Risk Disclosures (Continued) Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in the reported liabilities. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses in net earnings related to certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ (764 ) $ 58 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings (163 ) (92 ) Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income 1,264 257 Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f).

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February 27, 2021 K-66 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Omaha, Nebraska Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. K-67 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( “ claim liabilities ” ) under short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are $79,854 million as of December 31, 2020. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities include expected loss and expense ( “ loss ” ) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others: • We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions. • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by: • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities. • With the assistance of our actuarial specialists: • We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance contracts are $40,966 million as of December 31, 2020. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following, among others: • We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities and related assets, including those over the key assumptions. K-68 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities and related assets by: • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities and related assets. • With the assistance of our actuarial specialists: • We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts and related assets, we evaluated the process used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities and related assets. • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessed unexpected development and assessed internal rates of return. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $31 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company performed an interim reevaluation of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at the PCC reporting unit. This determination was made due to disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that had an adverse impact on the industries in which PCC operates. As a result of the reevaluation, the Company recognized goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the amount of approximately $10 billion, as the fair values of the PCC reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, PCC reported goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $21 billion as of December 31, 2020. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’ disclosures. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and discount rate selected by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Omaha, Nebraska February 27, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1985.

Significant accounting policies and practices (a) Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 27. Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March. COVID-19 has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects are varying significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the time necessary to distribute safe and effective vaccines and to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments (including U.S. Treasury Bills) with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (d) Investments in fixed maturity securities We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of these investments are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, as determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. Otherwise, we evaluate as of the balance sheet date whether the unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, along with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. (e) Investments in equity securities We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses. (f) Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20 % of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. (g) Receivables Receivables primarily consist of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to claims for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and claim benefits under life and health insurance contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for credit losses. See Note 1(w). In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including, collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (h) Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all of these loans at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured housing installment loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. (i) Derivatives We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j) Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. (k) Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2020, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 35 % of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 950 million as of December 31, 2019. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend useful lives or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years , machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years , interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 3 to 40 years . We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m) Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years . We use declining balance deprecation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is relatively greater during the earlier years of its life and maintenance and repair costs increase during the later years. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (n) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. (o) Revenue recognition We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (o) Revenue recognition (Continued) Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services, or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training and franchising and news distribution services. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases. (p) Losses and loss adjustment expenses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. (q) Retroactive reinsurance contracts We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with other short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. K-80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (r) Insurance policy acquisition costs We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability, and we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately $ 3.25 billion and $ 2.95 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (s) Life and annuity insurance benefits We compute liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates for most contracts range from 3 % to 7 %. (t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. (u) Foreign currency The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. (v) Income taxes Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is not likely. K-81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (v) Income taxes (Continued) Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. (w) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020 We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. We do not measure an allowance for expected credit losses on accrued interest and instead, as permitted, we elected to reverse uncollectible accrued interest through interest income on a timely basis. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. ( x ) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019 Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019 . Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with respect to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $ 6.2 billion and lease liabilities of $ 5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $ 300 million. Consequently, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $ 5.9 billion. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases. ( y ) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2018 On January 1, 2018 , we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions). ASU 2016-01 ASU 2018-02 ASC 606 Total Increase (decrease): Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 61,459 ) $ 84 $ — $ ( 61,375 ) Retained earnings 61,459 ( 84 ) ( 70 ) 61,305 Shareholders’ equity — — ( 70 ) ( 70 ) In adopting ASU 2016-01, as of January 1, 2018, we reclassified the net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Thereafter, the unrealized gains and losses from the changes during the period in the fair values of our equity securities are included within investment gains/losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified certain deferred income tax effects as of January 1, 2018 attributable to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings. K-82 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) ( z ) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2020 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Under current GAAP, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. In July 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage business. On October 5, 2020 , BHE and Dominion also agreed, as permitted under the acquisition agreement, to provide for the acquisition of all originally agreed upon businesses, except for certain pipeline assets (the “Excluded Assets”) and entered into a second acquisition agreement with respect to the Excluded Assets. The acquisition of the Dominion businesses, other than the Excluded Assets, was completed on November 1, 2020 and included more than 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, about 420 billion cubic feet of operated natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”). Under the terms of the second acquisition agreement, BHE agreed to acquire the Excluded Assets for approximately $ 1.3 billion in cash. The closing of this second acquisition is subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the first half of 2021. The cost of the acquisition completed on November 1, 2020, was approximately $ 2.5 billion after post-closing adjustments as provided in the agreement. The preliminary fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill are summarized as follows (in millions). Property, plant and equipment $ 9,254 Goodwill 1,732 Other 2,376 Assets acquired $ 13,362 Notes payable and other borrowings $ 5,615 Other 1,317 Liabilities assumed 6,932 Noncontrolling interests 3,916 Net assets $ 2,514 As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25 % economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100 % of the general partnership interest and 25 % of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary. The noncontrolling interests in the preceding table is attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties. On October 1, 2018, we acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), a writer of medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. The acquisition price was approximately $ 2.5 billion. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of MLMIC’s assets was approximately $ 6.1 billion, primarily investments ($ 5.2 billion), and the fair value of its liabilities was approximately $ 3.6 billion, primarily unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ($ 3.2 billion). K-83 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) ( 2 ) Business acquisitions (Continued) In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-ons” to several of our existing business operations. Aggregate consideration paid for bolt-on acquisitions, net of cash acquired was approximately $ 130 million in 2020, $ 1.7 billion in 2019 and $ 1.0 billion in 2018. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized by type below (in millions). Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value December 31, 2020 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 3,348 $ 55 $ — $ 3,403 Foreign governments 11,233 110 ( 5 ) 11,338 Corporate bonds 4,729 464 ( 2 ) 5,191 Other 414 66 ( 2 ) 478 $ 19,724 $ 695 $ ( 9 ) $ 20,410 December 31, 2019 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 3,054 $ 37 $ ( 1 ) $ 3,090 Foreign governments 8,584 63 ( 9 ) 8,638 Corporate bonds 5,896 459 ( 3 ) 6,352 Other 539 67 ( 1 ) 605 $ 18,073 $ 626 $ ( 14 ) $ 18,685 Investments in foreign governments include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 88 % of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2020 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Amounts are in millions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to early call or prepayment rights held by issuers. Due in one year or less Due after one year through five years Due after five years through ten years Due after ten years Mortgage-backed securities Total Amortized cost $ 10,379 $ 8,323 $ 373 $ 337 $ 312 $ 19,724 Fair value 10,448 8,456 496 640 370 20,410 K-84 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (4) Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized based on the primary industry of the investee in the table below (in millions). Cost Basis Net Unrealized Gains Fair Value December 31, 2020 * Banks, insurance and finance $ 26,312 $ 40,167 $ 66,479 Consumer products 34,747 111,583 146,330 Commercial, industrial and other 47,561 20,800 68,361 $ 108,620 $ 172,550 $ 281,170 * Approximately 68 % of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in four companies (American Express Company – $ 18.3 billion; Apple Inc. – $ 120.4 billion; Bank of America Corporation – $ 31.3 billion and The Coca-Cola Company – $ 21.9 billion).

On August 8, 2019, Berkshire invested a total of $ 10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion and warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, on August 3, 2020, the number of shares of common stock that can be purchased was increased to 83.86 million shares and the exercise price was reduced to $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or is mandatorily redeemable under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding tables. ( 5) Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. K-85 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (5) Equity method investments (Continued) We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $ 95 million in 2020, $ 493 million in 2019 and losses of approximately $ 2.7 billion in 2018. Equity method earnings (losses) included the effects of goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $ 850 million in 2020, $ 450 million in 2019 and $ 3.7 billion in 2018. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $ 521 million in each of 2020 and 2019 and $ 814 million in 2018, which we recorded as reductions in our carrying value. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 11.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 13.8 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $ 2.0 billion ( 15 % of carrying value). In light of this fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in a future period based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. Summarized financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Assets $ 99,830 $ 101,450 Liabilities 49,587 49,701 Year ending December 26, 2020 Year ending December 28, 2019 Year ending December 29, 2018 Sales $ 26,185 $ 24,977 $ 26,268 Net earnings (losses) attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders $ 356 $ 1,935 $ ( 10,192 ) Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our equity method earnings in these entities were $ 631 million in 2020, $ 683 million in 2019 and $ 563 million in 2018. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On December 31, 2020, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, supplying more than 11 billion gallons of fuel per year via more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. K-86 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (6) Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 are summarized below (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains/losses during the year on securities held at the end of the period $ 54,951 $ 69,581 $ ( 22,729 ) Investment gains/losses during the year on securities sold ( 14,036 ) 1,585 291 40,915 71,166 ( 22,438 ) Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 56 87 480 Gross realized losses ( 27 ) ( 25 ) ( 227 ) Other ( 39 ) ( 105 ) 30 $ 40,905 $ 71,123 $ ( 22,155 ) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 38.8 billion in 2020, $ 14.3 billion in 2019 and $ 18.8 billion in 2018 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold during the year, which are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and our original cost, were $ 6.2 billion in 2020, $ 3.2 billion in 2019 and $ 3.3 billion in 2018.

As a lessee, we primarily lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $ 5,579 million and lease liabilities were $ 5,469 million at December 31, 2020. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $ 5,941 million and lease liabilities were $ 5,882 million at December 31, 2019. Such amounts were included in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The weighted average term of these leases was approximately 7.3 years at December 31, 2020 and 7.7 years at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate used to measure lease liabilities was approximately 3.6 % at December 31, 2020 and 3.8 % at December 31, 2019. A summary of our remaining operating lease payments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).

December 31, 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of year $ 81,882 $ 81,025 Acquisitions of businesses 1,758 890 Impairment charges ( 10,033 ) ( 90 ) Other, including foreign currency translation 127 57 Balance at end of year* $ 73,734 $ 81,882 * Net of accumulated goodwill impairments of $ 11.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019. K-90 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (13) Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) The gross carrying amounts and related accumulated amortization of other intangible assets are summarized as follows (in millions). December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Insurance and other: Customer relationships $ 27,374 $ 5,756 $ 27,943 $ 5,025 Trademarks and trade names 5,206 779 5,286 759 Patents and technology 4,766 3,313 4,560 3,032 Other 3,339 1,375 3,364 1,286 $ 40,685 $ 11,223 $ 41,153 $ 10,102 Railroad, utilities and energy: Customer relationships $ 678 $ 361 $ 678 $ 324 Trademarks, trade names and other 1,003 98 325 84 $ 1,681 $ 459 $ 1,003 $ 408 Intangible asset amortization expense was $ 1,277 million in 2020, $ 1,317 million in 2019 and $ 1,393 million in 2018. Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2021 – $ 1,262 ; 2022 – $ 1,190 ; 2023 – $ 1,108 ; 2024 – $ 986 and 2025 – $ 906 . Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 19.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believed that the most significant of these disruptions related to the air travel and commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $ 31 billion. The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflected our assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts. (14) Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. The most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions). December 31, 2020 2019 Balance sheet liabilities - at fair value $ 1,065 $ 968 Notional value 10,991 14,385 Intrinsic value 727 397 Weighted average remaining life (in years) 1.2 1.8 The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of December 31, 2020 will expire by February 2023 . K-91 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (14) Derivative contracts (Continued) Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 1.9 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2020 and we have no counterparty credit risk. We recorded derivative contract losses of $ 159 million in 2020, gains of $ 1,484 million in 2019 and losses of $ 300 million in 2018, with respect to our equity index put option contracts. These gains and losses were primarily due to changes in the equity index values. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. Our regulated utility subsidiaries may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of their commodity price risks. Most of these net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 16), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 is as follows (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 73,019 $ 68,458 $ 61,122 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,855 ) ( 3,060 ) ( 3,201 ) Net liabilities 70,164 65,398 57,921 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 43,400 43,335 39,876 Prior accident years’ events ( 356 ) ( 752 ) ( 1,406 ) Total 43,044 42,583 38,470 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 17,884 ) ( 19,482 ) ( 18,391 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 18,862 ) ( 17,642 ) ( 15,452 ) Total ( 36,746 ) ( 37,124 ) ( 33,843 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment 480 ( 23 ) ( 331 ) Business acquisition (disposition) — ( 670 ) 3,181 Balances at December 31: Net liabilities 76,942 70,164 65,398 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,912 2,855 3,060 Gross liabilities $ 79,854 $ 73,019 $ 68,458 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Current accident year losses included approximately $ 950 million in 2020, $ 1.0 billion in 2019 and $ 1.6 billion in 2018 from significant catastrophe events occurring in each year. Current accident year losses in 2020 also reflected the effects of low private passenger automobile claims frequencies and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurance business attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 356 million in 2020, $ 752 million in 2019 and $ 1,406 million in 2018, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.5 % in 2020, 1.1 % in 2019 and 2.4 % in 2018. K-92 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $ 518 million in 2020, $ 457 million in 2019 and $ 937 million in 2018. The decrease in 2020 was primarily attributable to reductions for private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases for other casualty claims. The decrease in 2019 reflected reductions in medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partially offset by higher commercial auto and other liability claims. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to reductions for workers’ compensation, medical professional liability and private passenger automobile claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance increased $ 162 million in 2020 and were reduced $ 295 million in 2019 and $ 469 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 included increased claims estimates for legacy casualty exposures. Estimated claim liabilities included amounts for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance recoverable, of approximately $ 2.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims. Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The effects of businesses acquired or disposed during the period are reflected in the data presented on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). GEICO Physical Damage GEICO Auto Liability BH Primary Medical Professional Liability BH Primary Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty BHRG Property BHRG Casualty Total Unpaid losses and ALAE, net $ 524 $ 18,755 $ 7,897 $ 11,294 $ 11,280 $ 22,890 $ 72,640 Reinsurance recoverable — 1,109 49 621 181 864 2,824 Unpaid unallocated loss adjustment expenses 2,671 Other unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,719 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 79,854 GEICO GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K-93 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) GEICO’s incurred and paid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance, are summarized by accident year below for physical damage and auto liability claims. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all policy coverages and excludes projected IBNR claims. Dollars are in millions.

Incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. BH Primary Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

We use certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates. K-96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. Incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year, net of reinsurance. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. Dollars are in millions.

Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020 follow (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances at beginning of year $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) $ 42,937 $ ( 15,278 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — 1,138 ( 453 ) 603 ( 86 ) Prior years’ contracts ( 399 ) 1,306 378 810 ( 341 ) 1,260 Total ( 399 ) 1,306 1,516 357 262 1,174 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,076 ) — ( 909 ) — ( 1,365 ) — Balances at December 31 $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 907 $ 1,873 $ 1,436 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities have little or no practical analytical value. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities included $ 17.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 18.2 billion at December 31, 2019, with respect to an agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”) to indemnify AIG for 80 % of up to $ 25 billion of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of $ 25 billion retained by AIG for certain commercial insurance loss events occurring prior to 2016. The related deferred charge assets were $ 5.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2019. K-99 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 6 ) Retroactive reinsurance contracts (Continued) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $ 907 million in 2020, $ 1,188 million in 2019 and $ 919 million in 2018, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes. Our retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $ 12.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 12.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. (1 7 ) Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of December 31, 2020.

In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥ 195.5 billion (approximately $ 1.8 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.07 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. During 2020, BHFC repaid $ 900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 3.0 billion of senior notes consisting of $ 500 million of 1.85 % notes due in 2030 , $ 750 million of 1.45 % notes due in 2030 and $ 1.75 billion of 2.85 % notes due in 2050 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 625.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax losses of approximately $ 1.0 billion in 2020 and pre-tax gains of $ 192 million in 2019 and $ 366 million in 2018. K-100 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 7 ) Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at December 31, 2020. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In November 2020, BHE’s subsidiary debt increased $ 5.6 billion for the debt assumed in connection with the Dominion pipeline business acquisition. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries also issued new term debt of approximately $ 7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2 % and repaid $ 3.2 billion of term debt and reduced short-term borrowings. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During 2020, BNSF issued $ 575 million of 3.05 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2051 and repaid debt of $ 570 million. As of December 31, 2020, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 9.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 8.2 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes. On December 22, 2017, legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted. Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the statutory U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018 and provided for a one-time tax on certain accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. These effects were largely recorded in 2017 upon the enactment. In 2018, we reduced our estimate of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries and recognized additional deferred income tax rate change effects. Income tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 is as follows (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Federal $ 10,596 $ 19,069 $ ( 1,613 ) State 1,086 625 175 Foreign 758 1,210 1,117 $ 12,440 $ 20,904 $ ( 321 ) Current $ 5,052 $ 5,818 $ 5,176 Deferred 7,388 15,086 ( 5,497 ) $ 12,440 $ 20,904 $ ( 321 ) K-102 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 8 ) Income taxes (Continued) Income tax expense is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 in the table below (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Earnings before income taxes $ 55,693 $ 102,696 $ 4,001 Hypothetical income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ 11,696 $ 21,566 $ 840 Dividends received deduction and tax-exempt interest ( 448 ) ( 433 ) ( 393 ) State income taxes, less U.S. federal income tax benefit 858 494 138 Foreign tax rate differences 13 ( 6 ) 271 U.S. income tax credits ( 1,519 ) ( 942 ) ( 711 ) Net benefit from the enactment of the TCJA — — ( 302 ) Goodwill impairments 1,977 20 21 Other differences, net ( 137 ) 205 ( 185 ) $ 12,440 $ 20,904 $ ( 321 ) Effective income tax rate 22.3 % 20.4 % ( 8.0 )% We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011 and the tax years 2012 and 2013 remain open. The IRS is auditing Berkshire’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2014 through 2016 tax years. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2021. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, net unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1,113 million and $ 952 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2020, were $ 920 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. We recorded income tax expense of $ 60 million in 2020 and $ 377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. We do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2021. ( 19 ) Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $ 23 billion as ordinary dividends during 2021. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $ 5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $ 237 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 216 billion at December 31, 2019. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes. K-103 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 0 ) Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

K-104 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 0 ) Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).

We currently consider the related fair value measurements to contain Level 3 inputs. See Note 4 for information regarding these investments. Quantitative information as of December 31, 2020, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stock $ 8,891 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 9 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 375 bps Common stock warrants 86 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 9 years Volatility 32 % Derivative contract liabilities 1,065 Option pricing model Volatility 19 % Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in the Occidental Preferred and Occidental common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment. The Occidental Preferred is redeemable at Occidental’s option beginning in 2029. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the Occidental Preferred has a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments. In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. The Occidental common stock warrants contractually expire on the one-year anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding. Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. (2 3 ) Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return. K-110 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 4 ) Pension plans (Continued) A reconciliation of the pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to defined benefit pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Balance beginning of year $ ( 1,896 ) $ ( 1,184 ) Amount included in net periodic pension expense 141 94 Actuarial gains (losses) and other ( 496 ) ( 806 ) Balance end of year $ ( 2,251 ) $ ( 1,896 ) Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans. Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by management. Our defined contribution plan expense was approximately $ 1.4 billion in 2020, $ 1.2 billion in 2019 and $ 1.0 billion in 2018. (2 5 ) Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their businesses. As of December 31, 2020, estimated future payments under such arrangements were as follows: $ 14.6 billion in 2021, $ 4.5 billion in 2022, $ 3.4 billion in 2023, $ 2.8 billion in 2024, $ 3.1 billion in 2025 and $ 20.0 billion after 2025. The most significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business. Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be obligated to acquire their equity interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2020, we estimate the cost would have been approximately $ 6.3 billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners. ( 2 6 ) Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 is presented in the following table (in millions). 2020 2019 2018 Cash paid during the period for: Income taxes $ 5,001 $ 5,415 $ 4,354 Interest: Insurance and other 1,001 1,011 1,111 Railroad, utilities and energy 3,006 2,879 2,867 Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions 6,981 766 3,735 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 729 782 — K-111 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (27) Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts. Berkshire’s operating segments are as follows. Business Identity Business Activity Insurance: GEICO Underwriting private passenger automobile insurance mainly by direct response methods Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Underwriting multiple lines of property and casualty insurance policies for primarily commercial accounts Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Underwriting excess-of-loss, quota-share and facultative reinsurance worldwide BNSF Operation of one of the largest railroad systems in North America Berkshire Hathaway Energy Regulated electric and gas utility, including power generation and distribution activities and real estate brokerage activities Manufacturing Manufacturers of numerous products including industrial, consumer and building products, including home building and related financial services McLane Company Wholesale distribution of groceries and non-food items Service and retailing Providers of numerous services including shared aircraft ownership programs, aviation pilot training, electronic components distribution, various retailing businesses, including automobile dealerships and trailer and furniture leasing K-112 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (27) Business segment data (Continued) A disaggregation of our consolidated data for each of the three most recent years is presented as follows (in millions).

Business Description Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a large number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshire’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employ approximately 391,500 people worldwide. Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance entities. Berkshire’s insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty and life, accident and health risks worldwide. In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. K-1 The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing, and are expected to continue to implement, various regulatory tools and mandates. For example, the U.S. state regulators now require insurance groups to file an annual report, called an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead regulator. U.S. state regulators formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead group wide supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including a group capital calculation tool and various liquidity assessments, that could be imposed on insurance groups in the future. Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S. based insurers was approximately $216 billion at December 31, 2019. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the “2019 TRIA Reauthorization”). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in 2020, or any calendar year thereafter. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. During 2020 and thereafter, in the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2020 for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to approximate $1.3 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example: • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports; • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer; • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer's use of local and offshore reinsurance vary; • policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country; • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; • the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary significantly by country; and • regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country. K-2 Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach. Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in other countries, including Canada, various members of the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau and Dubai. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (“UK”) voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the EU (“Brexit”), which resulted in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the UK leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the European Union following Brexit. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU as result of Brexit, Berkshire expects to continue to maintain a substantial presence in London. Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Berkshire’s insurance businesses employ approximately 50,000 people. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows. GEICO —GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also insures motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate (including Esurance), Progressive and USAA. Significant advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 35% over the past five years. According to most recently published A.M. Best data for 2018, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2018 of approximately 57%, with GEICO’s market share being second largest at approximately 13.4%. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates its current market share is approximately 13.6%. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations. K-3 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group —The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below. NICO and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) provides commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional lines, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowners insurance. BH Specialty writes business on both an excess and surplus lines basis and an admitted basis in the U.S., and on a locally admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several cities in the U.S. and international offices located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia and Europe. BH Specialty currently intends to further expand its operations. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents. MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the United States. MedPro provides customized HCL insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance solutions in Europe, delivers liability insurance to other professionals, and offers specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines insurance on an admitted basis, as well as an excess and surplus basis. USLI markets policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide workers’ compensation, business owners’, commercial auto, commercial package and homeowners’ products to over 350,000 small and mid-sized businesses. GUARD also offers complementary professional liability and umbrella products nationwide. Policies are offered through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Central States Indemnity Company of Omaha, based in Omaha, Nebraska, primarily writes Medicare Supplement insurance. On October 1, 2018, NICO acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”). MLMIC has been the leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes its policies mostly on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. In October 2019, Berkshire sold its 81% interest in Applied Underwriters, Inc. (“Applied”). Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group —Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. Reinsurance business is written through National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, its subsidiaries and various other insurance subsidiaries wholly owned by Berkshire (collectively, the “NICO Group”) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. BHRG also conducts business activities globally in 23 countries. The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. K-4 Property/casualty The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks for clients worldwide. The NICO Group periodically participates in underwriting placements with major brokers in the London Market through Berkshire Hathaway International Insurance, Ltd., based in Great Britain. Business is written through intermediary brokers or directly with the insured or reinsured. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia Pacific countries. The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG (“GRAG”), based in Cologne Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in 23 countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. Life/health The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Approximately 27% of the aggregate life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group were in the United States, compared to 18% in Western Europe and 55% throughout the rest of the world. Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures. BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit coverages on closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable immediately after the inception of the contract. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification and are occasionally exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. For instance, in January 2017, NICO entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Under the agreement, NICO agreed to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion in excess of $25 billion retained by AIG, of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring in years prior to 2016. The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms, since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. K-5 Periodic payment annuity BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies, generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Similar to retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in establishing such premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. Investments of insurance businesses —Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and other in-house investment managers. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $84 billion at the end of 2014 to approximately $129 billion at the end of 2019, primarily through internal growth. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. Over the past five years, with the exception of 2017, Berkshire’s cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains. Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa Fe Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 40,750 employees at the end of 2019. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business. In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December 31, 2019, approximately 35% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 27% from industrial products, 21% from agricultural products and 17% from coal. Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) the Federal Railroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business. The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. K-6 Environmental Matters BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF. Utilities and Energy Businesses—Berkshire Hathaway Energy Berkshire currently owns 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”). BHE is a global energy company with subsidiaries that generate, transmit, store, distribute and supply energy. BHE’s locally managed businesses are organized as separate operating units. BHE’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of four regulated utility companies serving approximately 5.1 million retail customers, two interstate natural gas pipeline companies with approximately 16,300 miles of pipeline and a design capacity of approximately 8.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and ownership interests in electricity transmission businesses.

BHE employs approximately 23,000 people in connection with its various operations. General Matters PacifiCorp is a regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon, serving electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. The combined service territory’s diverse regional economy ranges from rural, agricultural and mining areas to urban, manufacturing and government service centers. No single segment of the economy dominates the combined service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorp’s exposure to economic fluctuations. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp sells electricity on a wholesale basis to other electricity retailers and wholesalers. MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) is a regulated electric and natural gas utility company headquartered in Iowa, serving electric and natural gas customers primarily in Iowa and also in portions of Illinois, South Dakota and Nebraska. MEC has a diverse retail customer base consisting of urban and rural residential customers and a variety of commercial and industrial customers. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, MEC sells electricity principally to markets operated by regional transmission organizations and natural gas on a wholesale basis. NV Energy, Inc. (“NV Energy”) is an energy holding company headquartered in Nevada, primarily consisting of two regulated utility subsidiaries, Nevada Power Company (“Nevada Power”) and Sierra Pacific Power Company (“Sierra Pacific”) (collectively, the “Nevada Utilities”). Nevada Power serves retail electric customers in southern Nevada and Sierra Pacific serves retail electric and natural gas customers in northern Nevada. The Nevada Utilities’ combined service territory’s economy includes gaming, mining, recreation, warehousing, manufacturing and governmental services. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, the Nevada Utilities sell electricity and natural gas on a wholesale basis. K-7 As vertically integrated utilities, BHE’s domestic utilities own approximately 29,000 net megawatts of generation capacity in operation and under construction. The domestic utilities business is subject to seasonal variations principally related to the use of electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating. Typically, regulated electric revenues are higher in the summer months, while regulated natural gas revenues are higher in the winter months. The Great Britain distribution companies consist of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, which own a substantial electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England in an area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. The distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated tariffs for the use of their distribution systems. AltaLink L.P. (“AltaLink”) is a regulated electric transmission-only utility company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. AltaLink’s high voltage transmission lines and related facilities transmit electricity from generating facilities to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory. The natural gas pipelines consist of Northern Natural Gas Company (“Northern Natural”) and Kern River Gas Transmission Company (“Kern River”). Northern Natural, based in Nebraska, owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States, as measured by pipeline miles, reaching from west Texas to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural’s pipeline system consists of approximately 14,600 miles of natural gas pipelines. Northern Natural’s extensive pipeline system, which is interconnected with many interstate and intrastate pipelines in the national grid system, has access to supplies from multiple major supply basins and provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. Northern Natural also operates three underground natural gas storage facilities and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units. Northern Natural’s pipeline system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand typically occurring during the months of November through March. Kern River, based in Utah, owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that consists of approximately 1,700 miles and extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. BHE Renewables is based in Iowa and owns interests in independent power projects having approximately 4,600 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Hawaii and the Philippines. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, BHE Renewables has invested over $3 billion in twenty-one wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Regulatory Matters PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission and distribution-only services. Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023. K-8 AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency , which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service and (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency within the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. Environmental Matters BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force November 4, 2016. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced the United States would begin the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, withdrawal cannot occur until four years after entry into force, making the United States’ withdrawal effective in November 2020. On October 10, 2017, the EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. The EPA’s repeal and replacement of the Clean Power Plan is not expected to have a material impact on BHE and its energy subsidiaries. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy. K-9 BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, through December 31, 201 9 , BHE’s cumulative investment in wind, solar, geothermal and biomass generation is approximately $2 9 billion. Non-Energy Businesses HomeServices of America, Inc. (“HomeServices”) is the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. In addition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices offers other integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking, title and closing services, property and casualty insurance, home warranties, relocation services and other home-related services. It operates under 47 brand names with over 43,000 real estate agents in over 900 brokerage offices in 30 states and the District of Columbia. In October 2012, HomeServices acquired a 66.7% interest in one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States, which offers and sells independently owned and operated residential real estate brokerage franchises. In April 2018, HomeServices acquired the remaining 33.3% interest. HomeServices’ franchise network currently includes approximately 380 franchisees in over 1,600 brokerage offices throughout the United States and Europe with nearly 53,000 real estate agents under two brand names. In exchange for certain fees, HomeServices provides the right to use the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices or Real Living brand names and other related service marks, as well as providing orientation programs, training and consultation services, advertising programs and other services. HomeServices’ principal sources of revenue are dependent on residential real estate sales, which are generally higher in the second and third quarters of each year. This business is highly competitive and subject to general real estate market conditions. Manufacturing Businesses Berkshire’s numerous and diverse manufacturing subsidiaries are grouped into three categories: (1) industrial products, (2) building products and (3) consumer products. Berkshire’s industrial products businesses manufacture specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, components for aerospace and power generation applications, and a variety of other products primarily for industrial use. The building products group produces prefabricated and site-built residential homes, flooring products, insulation, roofing and engineered products, building and engineered components, paint and coatings and bricks and masonry products. The consumer products group manufactures recreational vehicles, alkaline batteries, various apparel products, jewelry and custom picture framing products. Information concerning the major activities of these three groups follows. Industrial products Precision Castparts Precision Castparts Corp.

The majority of PCC’s sales are from purchase orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their work forces and inflation.

Retailing Businesses Berkshire’s retailing businesses include automotive, home furnishings and several other operations that sell various consumer products to consumers. Information regarding each of these operations follows. Berkshire’s retailing businesses employ approximately 29,000 people. Berkshire Hathaway Automotive The Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Group, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 106 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 29 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company. Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 70% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. K-19 BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law. BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Risk Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 89, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 96. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions. K-21 We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value. We concentrate a high percentage of the investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities and diversify our investment portfolios far less than is conventional in the insurance industry. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings. Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in their statutory surplus. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits. Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts, which contain equity price risks. Most of the contracts remaining at year end 2019 will expire by February 2023. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payments upon contract expirations. Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures, and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses. A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. K-22 Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. Cyber security risks We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks, or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses. Risks unique to our regulated businesses Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently, we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period. K-23 The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses. The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($115.5 billion at December 31, 2019), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. For example, federal legislation, enacted in 2008 and amended in 2015, mandated the implementation of positive train control technology by December 31, 2020, on certain mainline track where inter-city and commuter passenger railroads operate and where toxic-by-inhalation (“TIH”) hazardous materials are transported. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport TIH chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; transacting between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. K-24 Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and /or capital resources of these businesses. Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 4.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. K-28 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Security Holder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbols: BRK.A and BRK.B, respectively. Shareholders Berkshire had approximately 1,750 record holders of its Class A common stock and 19,200 record holders of its Class B common stock at February 13, 2020. Record owners included nominees holding at least 411,000 shares of Class A common stock and 1,405,000,000 shares of Class B common stock on behalf of beneficial-but-not-of-record owners. Dividends Berkshire has not declared a cash dividend since 1967. Common Stock Repurchase Program For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2019 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program October 1 through October 9: Class A common stock 688 $ 306,086.60 688 * Class B common stock 1,497,623 $ 204.07 1,497,623 * November 11 through November 29: Class A common stock 1,326 $ 328,974.91 1,326 * Class B common stock 3,657,884 $ 218.62 3,657,884 * December 2 through December 31: Class A common stock 674 $ 333,298.06 674 * Class B common stock 953,070 $ 221.67 953,070 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion.

Beginning in 2018, investment gains/losses include the changes in fair values of equity securities during the period. Previously, investment gains/losses of equity securities were recognized in earnings when securities were sold or were other-than-temporarily impaired. Net earnings in 2017 includes a one-time net benefit of $29.1 billion attributable to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Insurance – underwriting $ 325 $ 1,566 $ (2,219 ) Insurance – investment income 5,530 4,554 3,887 Railroad 5,481 5,219 3,959 Utilities and energy 2,840 2,621 2,033 Manufacturing, service and retailing 9,372 9,364 7,282 Investment and derivative gains/losses 57,445 (17,737 ) 1,377 Other 424 (1,566 ) (485 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — — 29,106 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 81,417 $ 4,021 $ 44,940 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities. These gains and losses have been very significant given the size of our holdings and the inherent volatility in securities prices, producing extraordinary volatility in our reported net earnings for 2019 and 2018. Prior to 2018, the changes in unrealized gains and losses pertaining to such investments were recorded in other comprehensive income. The new accounting treatment has no effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. Net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a one-time non-cash reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities from the reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a net benefit of approximately $900 million primarily attributable to our earnings from Kraft Heinz, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense of approximately $1.4 billion on the deemed repatriation of certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the significance, we presented these one-time effects as a distinct item in the preceding table. Accordingly, the after-tax figures presented for 2017 in the discussion of our various operating businesses and other activities exclude the one-time effects of the TCJA. After-tax earnings of our business operations in 2019 and 2018 were favorably affected by lower U.S. income tax expense compared to 2017, primarily attributable to a reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effect of the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate on the comparative after-tax earnings of our various business operations varied, reflecting the differences in the mix of earnings subject to income tax, income tax credits and the effects of state and local income taxes. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $325 million in 2019 compared to earnings of $1.6 billion in 2018 and after-tax losses of approximately $2.2 billion in 2017. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $800 million in 2019, $1.3 billion in 2018 and $1.95 billion in 2017. Earnings from primary insurance operations were lower in 2019 and losses from reinsurance were higher than in 2018. After-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 included lower earnings from reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ property/casualty loss events as compared to 2018 and losses of $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes on certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains of $207 million in 2018 and losses of $295 million in 2017. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, which increased 17.2% over 2017. These increases reflected increases in interest and dividend income. K-32 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather in the first half of the year. All key routes impacted by flooding resumed service by the third quarter. Our railroad business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume, higher average revenue per car/unit and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 as all businesses produced higher earnings in 2019 versus 2018. Our utilities and energy businesses produced higher after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the effects of losses incurred in 2017 in connection with the prepayment of certain long-term debt, increased earnings at the natural gas pipelines and other energy businesses and the TCJA income tax benefits recognized in 2018. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were relatively unchanged from 2018. Operating results of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs. After-tax earnings in 2018 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 29% over 2017, due to lower effective income tax rates and a 13% increase in pre-tax earnings. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2019 and 2018 included significant unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on our holdings of equity securities. After-tax unrealized gains on equity securities were approximately $53.7 billion in 2019 compared to after-tax losses of $20.6 billion in 2018. After-tax investment gains in 2019 also included after-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities of $2.6 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2018. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. After-tax other earnings included equity method investment earnings of $1.0 billion in 2019, losses of $1.4 billion in 2018 and earnings of $1.1 billion in 2017. The losses in 2018 were attributable to Kraft Heinz, partly offset by earnings from other equity method investments. Other earnings also included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $58 million in 2019, $289 million in 2018, and losses of $655 million in 2017 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S. based financing subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant. We incurred estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2019, $1.6 billion in 2018 and $3.0 billion in 2017 from significant catastrophe events. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $115.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. K-33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Underwriting gain (loss): GEICO $ 1,506 $ 2,449 $ (310 ) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 383 670 719 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (1,472 ) (1,109 ) (3,648 ) Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) 417 2,010 (3,239 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 92 444 (1,020 ) Net underwriting gain (loss) $ 325 $ 1,566 $ (2,219 ) Effective income tax rate 24.2 % 21.4 % 32.0 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 36,016 $ 34,123 $ 30,547 Premiums earned $ 35,572 100.0 $ 33,363 100.0 $ 29,441 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 28,937 81.3 26,278 78.8 25,497 86.6 Underwriting expenses 5,129 14.5 4,636 13.9 4,254 14.5 Total losses and expenses 34,066 95.8 30,914 92.7 29,751 101.1 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ 1,506 $ 2,449 $ (310 ) 2019 versus 2018 Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4% over the past twelve months, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy due to coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales of 10.9% and a decrease in the number of policies not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% to $28.9 billion. GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018. The loss ratio increase in 2019 reflected continuing increases in loss severities, slightly offset by lower storm-related losses. Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses regularly include changes in the ultimate claim loss estimates during the period for prior years’ loss events, which produce pre-tax underwriting earnings or losses in the period of the change. GEICO increased ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $42 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of $222 million in 2018. K-34 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Underwriting expenses in 2019 were $5.1 billion, an increase of $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2019 was 14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. 2018 versus 2017 Premiums written were $34.1 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.7% compared to 2017. The increase reflected voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 3.3% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 6.4%. The increase in premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The rate increases were in response to accelerating claim costs in previous years. Although policies-in-force increased 540,000 during 2018, the rate of increase slowed, as voluntary auto new business sales decreased 4.7% compared to 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2018 were $26.3 billion, an increase of $781 million (3.1%) compared to 2017. GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio for 2018 was 78.8%, a decline of 7.8 percentage points compared to 2017. Losses from significant catastrophe events were $105 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California) and approximately $450 million in 2017 (Hurricanes Harvey and Irma). GEICO reduced ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $222 million in 2018 and increased estimated prior year ultimate liabilities by $517 million in 2017. Claims frequencies in 2018 for property damage, collision, and bodily and personal injury protection coverages declined (two to four percent range) compared to 2017. Average claims severities in 2018 increased for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range) versus 2017. Underwriting expenses in 2018 were approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of $382 million (9.0%) over 2017. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2018 was 13.9%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2017. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters (sold in October 2019), Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 9,843 $ 8,561 $ 7,483 Premiums earned $ 9,165 100.0 $ 8,111 100.0 $ 7,143 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 6,336 69.1 5,261 64.9 4,511 63.1 Underwriting expenses 2,446 26.7 2,180 26.9 1,913 26.8 Total losses and expenses 8,782 95.8 7,441 91.8 6,424 89.9 Pre-tax underwriting gain $ 383 $ 670 $ 719 Premiums written in 2019 increased approximately $1.3 billion (15.0%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty (30%), GUARD (28%) and MedPro Group (14%) and from the effects of the MLMIC acquisition, partially offset by the effects of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters and lower volume at BHHC. The increases in premiums earned in 2019 reflected the overall volume increase over the past year. K-35 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $383 million in 2019 and $670 million in 2018. BH Primary’s aggregate loss ratios were 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred included reductions for prior years’ loss events of $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018. The decrease in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated medical professional liability and workers’ compensation losses, partially offset by higher commercial auto and other liability losses. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019 that affected BH Primary. Underwriting results in 2018 included estimated losses from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California of approximately $190 million. Premiums written and earned in 2018 increased 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to 2017. The increases were primarily attributable to written premium growth at BH Specialty (33%), GUARD (19%), NICO Primary (14%) and BHHC (8%). BH Primary’s loss ratios were 64.9% in 2018 and 63.1% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included losses from significant catastrophe events of $190 million in 2018 from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California and $225 million in 2017 from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net gains from the reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $715 million in 2018 and $766 million in 2017. The liability reductions in each year primarily related to healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation business. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Premiums earned in 2019 increased $983 million (11.0%) versus 2018. The increase in premiums written reflected overall growth in U.S. and international markets. The growth was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations for renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Property/casualty premiums written in 2018 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 22.0% over 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to new business and increased participations for renewal business in both property and casualty lines. Premiums earned included $1.7 billion in 2019 and $1.8 billion in both 2018 and 2017 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were $7.3 billion in 2019, $6.9 billion in 2018 and $7.2 billion in 2017 and losses and loss adjustment expense ratios were 73.8% in 2019, 77.6% in 2018 and 95.6% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included incurred losses from significant catastrophe events occurring each year, including approximately $1.0 billion in 2019 ($700 million in the fourth quarter), $1.3 billion in 2018 ($1.1 billion in the fourth quarter) and $2.4 billion in 2017. Losses in 2019 derived from Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and wildfires in California and Australia. Losses in 2018 derived from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses in 2017 derived from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California. Before the effects of significant catastrophe events, losses and loss adjustment expense ratios were 64% in 2019, 63% in 2018 and 64% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included gains from net decreases in estimated ultimate claim liabilities attributable to prior years’ loss events of approximately $295 million in 2019, $469 million in 2018 and $295 million in 2017. Such decreases as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0% in 2019, 1.7% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2017.

In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. The amendment effectively eliminated BHLN’s future exposures under the contract. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract in 2019 of $49 million while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. Life/health premiums earned in 2019 also included $228 million from a single reinsurance contract covering health insurance risks. We also experienced volume growth in several international life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower U.S. life volumes. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $326 million in 2019. Underwriting results for 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to the yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions, increased U.S. long-term care liabilities due to discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business. Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $167 million in 2019. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which derive from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Life/health premiums earned in 2018 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $535 million (11.1%) over 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the North America, Asia and Australia life insurance markets. Our life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $216 million in 2018 and losses of $52 million in 2017. The underwriting earnings in 2018 reflected lower losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by lower earnings from the run-off of variable annuity guarantee contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded pre-tax losses of $450 million from discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions associated with long-term care liabilities. Pre-tax earnings from variable annuity guarantee contracts were $34 million in 2018 and $256 million in 2017. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2019 and 2018 were $684 million and $517 million, respectively, and were attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Premiums earned in 2017 included $10.2 billion from an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (the “AIG Agreement”). At the inception of our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we record the estimated ultimate claim liabilities, and we also record the excess of such claim liabilities over the premiums received as a deferred charge asset. Thus, as of the inception dates of these contracts, there is no net underwriting gain or loss. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency remeasurement produced pre-tax losses of $76 million in 2019, gains of $169 million in 2018 and losses of $264 million in 2017. Retroactive reinsurance contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses of $1,189 million in 2019, $947 million in 2018 and $1,066 million in 2017. Losses included deferred charge amortization of $646 million in 2019, $611 million in 2018 and $527 million in 2017 related to the AIG Agreement. In 2019, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $378 million compared to a decrease of $341 million in 2018. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $125 million in 2019 and earnings of $185 million in 2018. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. K-38 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2019 were $863 million, a decrease of $293 million (25.3%) compared to 2018, while premiums earned in 2018 increased $258 million (28.7%) compared to 2017. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and remeasurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency remeasurement losses were $40 million in 2019 compared to gains of $93 million in 2018 and losses of $190 million in 2017. Excluding foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $509 million in 2019 compared to $433 million in 2018 and $481 million in 2017. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities were $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2019, the weighted average discount rate was approximately 4.1%. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Interest and other investment income $ 2,075 $ 1,851 $ 1,263 Dividend income 4,525 3,652 3,592 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 6,600 5,503 4,855 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,070 949 968 Net investment income $ 5,530 $ 4,554 $ 3,887 Effective income tax rate 16.1 % 17.2 % 19.9 % Interest and other investment income in 2019 increased $224 million (12.1%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset by lower income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income in 2019 increased $873 million (23.9%) compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels over the past year, including the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% Cumulative Preferred Stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation on August 8, 2019, and higher dividend rates on common stock investments. We continue to hold large balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While short-term interest yields in the U.S. were higher in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, interest rates declined during the second half of the year. Accordingly, earnings from such balances will likely be lower in 2020 than in 2019. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Pre-tax interest and other investment income in 2018 increased $588 million (46.6%) compared to 2017. The increase reflected the effect of higher short-term interest rates in 2018 and higher other investment income, partly offset by lower interest income as a result of lower average investments in fixed maturity securities. Dividend income increased $60 million (1.7%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting the impact of increased investments in marketable equity securities and higher dividend rates on common stock holdings, partially offset by Restaurant Brands International’s redemption of our $3 billion investment in 9% preferred stock in December 2017. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $129 billion at December 31, 2019, $123 billion at December 31, 2018 and $114 billion at December 31, 2017. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $417 million in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative. Pre-tax underwriting losses were approximately $3.2 billion in 2017 and our average cost of float in 2017 was approximately 3.0%.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped. These business groups include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Revenues $ 23,515 $ 23,855 $ 21,387 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 5,347 5,394 5,023 Fuel 2,944 3,346 2,518 Purchased services 2,700 2,870 2,514 Depreciation and amortization 2,403 2,317 2,352 Equipment rents, materials and other 1,801 2,024 1,636 Total operating expenses 15,195 15,951 14,043 Interest expense 1,070 1,041 1,016 16,265 16,992 15,059 Pre-tax earnings 7,250 6,863 6,328 Income taxes 1,769 1,644 2,369 Net earnings $ 5,481 $ 5,219 $ 3,959 Effective income tax rate 24.4 % 24.0 % 37.4 % 2019 versus 2018 BNSF’s revenues were $23.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $340 million (1.4%) versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. Volume was 10.2 million cars/units compared to 10.7 million in 2018. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-tax earnings in 2019 were approximately $7.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an increase in average revenue per car/unit, BNSF's earnings in 2019 benefitted from a reduction in total operating expenses. K-40 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 4.6%. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports. Revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 3.0%. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes, and reduced car loadings due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Strength in the energy sector, which drove higher demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the decreases in volumes. Revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower volumes of 5.1% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies, and the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018. This decrease reflected lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volumes of 5.3%. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the effects of lower natural gas prices. Operating expenses were $15.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of $756 million (4.7%) compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points to 64.6% in 2019 versus 2018. BNSF's expenses in 2019 reflected lower volume-related costs, lower fuel prices, the effects of cost control initiatives, and a retirement plan curtailment gain, partially offset by the costs associated with the adverse weather conditions. Fuel expenses decreased $402 million (12.0%) compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes, and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $170 million (5.9%) compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense, and higher insurance recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $223 million (11.0%) compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $120 million curtailment gain from the amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans, as well as from lower locomotive and various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls. BNSF’s effective income tax rate was 24.4% in 2019, 24.0% in 2018 and 37.4% in 2017. The rate in 2017 excluded the effects of the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. statutory income tax rate. 2018 versus 2017 BNSF’s revenues were $23.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.5 billion (11.5%) over 2017. BNSF’s revenues in 2018 reflected a 6.2% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.1% increase in volume. Combined volume was 10.7 million cars/units compared to 10.3 million in 2017. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit, higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, and business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2017. Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.1% compared to 2017, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit and volume increases of 2.9%. The volume increases were due to higher domestic intermodal volumes, as well as growth in imports and containerized agricultural product exports, partially offset by a sizable contract loss. Revenues from industrial products were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 16.2% from 2017. The increase was attributable to volume increases of 9.8% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2018 increased for petroleum products, building products, construction products, and plastics. Revenues from agricultural products increased 8.8% in 2018 to $4.7 billion compared to 2017. The increase was due to higher volumes of 9.0%, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased due to strong export and domestic corn shipments, as well as higher fertilizer and other grain products volumes, partially offset by a reduction in soybean and wheat exports. Revenues from coal in 2018 increased 4.3% to $4.0 billion compared to 2017, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 0.8%. The volume decrease in 2018 was due mainly to utility plant retirements combined with competition from natural gas and renewables, mostly offset by market share gains and increased export volumes. K-41 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Total operating expenses were $16.0 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.9 billion (13.6%) compared to 2017. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.2 percentage points to 66.9% in 2018 versus 2017. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $371 million (7.4%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to wage inflation and increased headcount and associated training costs. Fuel expenses increased $828 million (32.9%) compared to 2017 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. Purchased services expense increased $356 million (14.2%) compared to 2017, due to higher purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, as well as increased intermodal ramping, drayage, and other volume-related costs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense increased $388 million (23.7%) compared to 2017, reflecting higher locomotive material expenses, personal injury expenses, derailment-related costs, and property taxes, as well as the impact of a benefit in 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these regulated operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHE’s regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 15,371 $ 15,573 $ 15,171 Real estate operating revenue 4,473 4,214 3,443 Other income 270 200 240 Total revenue 20,114 19,987 18,854 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 4,586 4,769 4,518 Energy operating expense 6,824 6,969 6,354 Real estate operating costs and expense 4,251 4,000 3,229 Interest expense 1,835 1,777 2,254 Total costs and expense 17,496 17,515 16,355 Pre-tax earnings 2,618 2,472 2,499 Income tax expense (benefit) * (526 ) (452 ) 148 Net earnings after income taxes 3,144 2,924 2,351 Noncontrolling interests 18 23 40 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Energy 3,126 2,901 2,311 Noncontrolling interests 286 280 278 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 2,840 $ 2,621 $ 2,033 Effective income tax rate (20.1 )% (18.3 )% 5.9 % * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generat ion. K-42 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 PacifiCorp $ 773 $ 739 $ 763 MidAmerican Energy Company 781 669 597 NV Energy 365 317 365 Northern Powergrid 256 239 251 Natural gas pipelines 422 387 270 Other energy businesses 608 489 404 Real estate brokerage 160 145 118 Corporate interest and other (239 ) (84 ) (457 ) $ 3,126 $ 2,901 $ 2,311 PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Net earnings after income taxes were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million (4.6%) compared to 2018, reflecting slightly higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from additional plant-in-service. Utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as higher retail revenue from a 0.4% increase in retail customer volumes, in part due to the favorable impact of weather, was largely offset by lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes. Net earnings after income taxes decreased $24 million (3.1%) in 2018 as compared to 2017. The change in after-tax earnings reflected the unfavorable utility margin and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher other income. Utility margin in 2018 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of $198 million (6%) versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $197 million decline in retail revenues from the effects of lower average rates of $180 million (including the impact of the TCJA of $152 million) and a reduction in volumes (0.2%), largely attributable to the impacts of weather. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Net earnings after income taxes of $781 million in 2019 increased $112 million (16.7%) as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increases in electric utility margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking, and other income. Electric utility margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes of 1.4%, as an increase in industrial volumes of 4.0% was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impact of weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service (net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense. Net earnings after income taxes were $669 million in 2018, an increase of $72 million (12.1%) compared to 2017, reflecting higher electric utility margin, higher depreciation and operating expenses and higher income tax benefits, partly due to higher production tax credits. Electric utility margin was $1.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $122 million (7%) compared to 2017, which was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $102 million, reflecting higher recoveries through bill riders and volumes, partially offset by lower rates, predominantly from the impact of the TCJA. The increase in depreciation expense included $65 million from additional wind generation and other plant placed in-service and $44 million from Iowa revenue sharing. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Net earnings after income taxes were $365 million in 2019, an increase of $48 million (15.1%) compared to 2018, as lower operating expenses were partly offset by lower electric utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable to the impacts of weather, and rate reductions from the impact of the TCJA, partially offset by retail customer growth. Net earnings after income taxes decreased $48 million (13.2%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting lower electric utility margin and increased depreciation and operating expenses. Electric utility margin decreased $52 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the effects of the TCJA, partially offset by higher retail sales volumes. K-43 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Northern Powergrid Net earnings after income taxes increased 7.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar ($10 million). Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable to higher tariff rates, partly offset by lower distributed units. Net earnings after income taxes were $239 million in 2018, a decrease of $12 million (4.8%) compared to 2017, reflecting higher distribution revenues, increased depreciation and operating expenses, including higher pension settlement losses, and a $9 million increase from the effects of a weaker U.S. Dollar. Natural gas pipelines Net earnings after income taxes increased $35 million (9.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased spending on capital projects. Net earnings after income taxes were $387 million in 2018, a 43.3% increase ($117 million) compared to 2017, reflecting higher transportation revenues from higher volumes and rates due to unique market opportunities and colder average temperatures, lower depreciation expense and a comparative increase in operating expenses. Other energy businesses Net earnings after income taxes in 2019 were $608 million, an increase of $119 million (24.3%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments and $25 million from new and existing projects and activities), higher after-tax income from geothermal and natural gas units of $53 million, largely due to higher generation and favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P. Net earnings after income taxes increased $85 million (21.0%) in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting increased revenues from existing renewable energy projects from overall higher generation and pricing, increased earnings from wind tax equity investments of $34 million and earnings from additional wind and solar capacity placed in-service, partially offset by higher operating expenses at existing projects. Real estate brokerage Net earnings after income taxes increased 10.3% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher after-tax earnings at existing mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business acquisitions, partially offset by lower after-tax earnings at existing brokerage businesses, primarily from lower units and margins. Net earnings after income taxes were $145 million in 2018, an increase of $27 million (22.9%) compared to 2017. The increase reflected earnings from acquired businesses, higher comparative operating expenses and lower margins at existing businesses and lower income tax expense due to the impact of the TCJA. Corporate interest and other Net earnings after income taxes decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to income tax benefits recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, higher corporate interest and lower after-tax earnings from non-regulated energy services. Net earnings after income taxes increased $373 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an after-tax charge of $246 million recognized in 2017 from a tender offer completed in December 2017 to redeem certain long-term debt of BHE and the TCJA income tax benefits recognized in 2018. K-44 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Earnings * 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Manufacturing $ 62,730 $ 61,883 $ 57,645 $ 9,522 $ 9,366 $ 8,324 Service and retailing 79,945 78,926 76,994 2,843 2,942 2,603 $ 142,675 $ 140,809 $ 134,639 Pre-tax earnings 12,365 12,308 10,927 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,993 2,944 3,645 $ 9,372 $ 9,364 $ 7,282 Effective income tax rate 23.7 % 23.4 % 32.8 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $788 million in 2019, $932 million in 2018 and $937 million in 2017. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the “Other” earnings section on page K-53. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. Industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon also provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail, intermodal container and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Industrial products $ 30,594 $ 30,679 $ 28,566 $ 5,635 $ 5,822 $ 5,065 Building products 20,327 18,677 16,946 2,636 2,336 2,147 Consumer products 11,809 12,527 12,133 1,251 1,208 1,112 $ 62,730 $ 61,883 $ 57,645 $ 9,522 $ 9,366 $ 8,324 K-45 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the industrial products group were $30.6 billion in 2019, a slight decrease from 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $5.6 billion in 2019 compared to $5.8 billion in 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018. PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. PCC experienced increased sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets compared to 2018. The increase in aerospace sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs, such as LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries and sales. While we expect that Boeing’s decision to suspend production of its 737 MAX aircraft may reduce demand for certain of our aerospace products in 2020, we also anticipate a significant portion of this volume reduction will be offset by incremental volume for other programs. We are also seeing stabilization in demand for our industrial gas turbine products within the power markets after two years of declines. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected increased sales of aerospace products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which was partially offset by lower earnings from the power markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC continues to incur incremental costs to meet required deliveries to customers associated with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace products. PCC implemented certain measures and intends to implement additional measures to address these issues and improve manufacturing efficiencies. Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $354 million (5.2%) compared to 2018. The decline reflected lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. A fire at Lubrizol’s Rouen, France manufacturing, blending and storage facility on September 26, 2019 resulted in the suspension of operations, which contributed significantly to the decline in Additives volumes. Those operations partially restarted in December 2019. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019 declined 4% from 2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire. Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins. Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions over the past year, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and the impact of lower metal prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container leasing revenue and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 increased $12 million (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased earnings in several sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal Services and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other expenses. IMC’s revenues in 2019 declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues from recent business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes. K-46 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) CTB’s revenues decreased 1.5% in 2019 versus 2018. The comparative decline was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower revenues from grain and protein equipment, partly offset by higher revenues from processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings increased 11.7% in 2019 as compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of favorable changes in business mix, the moderation of cost increases of certain raw materials and better pricing efficiency. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues from industrial products businesses were approximately $30.7 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion (7.4%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the industrial products group were approximately $5.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $757 million (14.9%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% in 2018 and 17.7% in 2017. The comparative earnings increase was partially attributable to certain one-time charges at PCC and Lubrizol in 2017. PCC’s revenues in 2018 were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to 2017, which reflected increased demand in aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower demand for industrial gas turbine products. In addition, PCC experienced lower sales of certain pipe products in 2018, primarily attributable to the U.S tariffs. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 16.0% in 2018 compared to 2017. PCC’s earnings in 2017 included certain one-time inventory and impairment charges of $272 million. Results in 2018 were negatively affected by costs associated with the temporary unplanned shut-down of certain metals facilities, metal press outages and lower earnings from the industrial gas turbine business. The facilities that were shut-down gradually resumed production and were approximately 80% operational at the end of 2018. In addition, the new aircraft programs involve relatively complex manufacturing processes, negatively affecting earnings. Lubrizol’s revenues in 2018 were $6.8 billion, an increase of 5.9% compared to 2017 due to higher average sales prices, favorable changes in product mix and foreign currency translation effects, and a 2% increase in aggregate unit volumes. Lubrizol experienced significant increases in average material unit costs during 2018 and 2017, necessitating increases in sales prices. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume included increases in the Advanced Materials (5%) and the Additives (1%) product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased 43.5% compared to 2017, which included pre-tax losses of approximately $190 million related to Lubrizol’s disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business and related intangible asset impairments and restructuring charges. Before such charges, Lubrizol’s earnings increased 17%, reflecting the previously mentioned increases in sales volumes and selling prices, as well as lower other restructuring charges, lower net interest expense, and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Marmon’s revenues in 2018 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 5.5% as compared to 2017. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to volume increases in the Transportation Products sector, higher average metals prices, and the effects of business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases in the Beverage Technologies and Rail Products and Services sectors. Rail Products and Services sector revenues also decreased due to lower railcar lease revenues, partly offset by increased railcar equipment sales and repair services. Throughout 2018, the railcar leasing business experienced the negative effects of lower lease renewal rates for railcars versus the rates on expiring leases. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased 5.6% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings from the Rail Products and Services sector ($126 million) and the Foodservice Technologies and Retail Solutions sectors ($33 million), partially offset by increased earnings from the Transportation Products sector and a gain in 2018 from the sale of certain assets of the Beverage Technologies sector of $44 million. The Rail Products and Services earnings decline was attributable to lower railcar leasing revenues and higher lease fleet repair costs. IMC’s revenues increased 16.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a combination of factors, including higher unit sales, the effects of business acquisitions, and foreign currency translation effects from a weaker average U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2018. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a combination of higher sales, increased manufacturing efficiencies, the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. CTB’s revenues increased 4.0% in 2018 versus 2017, due to favorable foreign currency translation effects and modest sales growth in protein production and processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 were lower than 2017, primarily due to lower gross sales margins attributable to raw material cost increases and higher other operating expenses. K-47 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products 2019 versus 2018 Revenues of the building products group were $20.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $2.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.0% and 12.5% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The comparative increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.16 billion (26%), reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while average prices declined 5%. Manufactured home unit sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest income from lending activities in 2019 increased 6.7% compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 was attributable to home building activities, which reflected the increases in home sales, and manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities in 2019 increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to higher average loan balances, increased other financial services earnings and lower credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018. Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined, primarily attributable to lower volumes. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities closure costs. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the building products group in 2018 were approximately $18.7 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the building products group were approximately $2.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.8% versus 2017. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2018 and 12.7% in 2017. Clayton Homes’ revenues were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 20.7% over 2017. The increase was driven by an increase in revenues from home sales of $971 million (28.2%), primarily due to a 105% increase in unit sales of site-built homes attributable to businesses acquired over the last two years. Unit sales of manufactured homes in 2018 also increased 4.9% compared to 2017. Average unit prices of site-built homes are considerably higher than traditional manufactured homes. In addition, interest income from lending activities increased 4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased average outstanding loan balances. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $911 million in 2018, an increase of $145 million (19.0%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase in earnings from home building (manufactured housing and site-built homes) activities, which reflected the impact of increased home sales and margins. Pre-tax earnings from lending activities in 2018 declined 2% compared to 2017, as increased interest expense, attributable to higher average debt balances and interest rates, and higher operating costs more than offset the increase in interest income. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $14.7 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. Revenues of our other building products businesses increased 5.8% in 2018 to approximately $12.6 billion compared to 2017. In 2018, Shaw’s sales increased 7.9% and Johns Manville’s sales increased 7.2% as compared to 2017. The increases reflected higher average selling prices, product mix changes and overall unit volume increases. K-48 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Raw material and production costs in 2018 of our building products businesses were generally higher than in 2017. For instance, steel, titanium dioxide and petrochemicals costs were substantially higher in 2018 than in 2017, as were product delivery costs, due in part to the shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. These cost increases precipitated sales price increases, although such increases lagged the increases in raw materials costs. Consumer products 2019 versus 2018 Consumer products revenues were $11.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of $718 million (5.7%) versus 2018. Revenues of Forest River declined 12.9% versus 2018, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and footwear revenues declined 1.1% compared to 2018. Despite a comparative revenue increase of 3.5% in 2019, Brooks Sports operating results were negatively affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in the second quarter. In addition, our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for certain products, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $1.25 billion in 2019, an increase of 3.6% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 10.6% in 2019 and 9.6% in 2018. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch, partially offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River. 2018 versus 2017 Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.5 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2017, which was primarily due to revenue increases at Forest River and at our apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River’s revenues increased 2.6% in 2018, reflecting relatively unchanged unit sales versus 2017. However, over the second half of the year, comparative sales at Forest River declined 5%, reflecting a 7% decline in units sold. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 4.6% to approximately $4.3 billion, primarily due to increased sales volume at Brooks Sports and Garan. Pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 9.6% in 2018 and 9.2% in 2017. The increase in earnings reflected increases from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Larson Juhl. Forest River’s pre-tax earnings declined 9.0% compared to 2017. Operating results were adversely affected over the second half of 2018, and in the fourth quarter in particular, by higher material costs, which, together with the effects of lower sales volumes, contributed to a 28% reduction in fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. Pre-tax earnings of the apparel and footwear businesses increased 6.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenues and sales mix changes. Duracell’s pre-tax earnings increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the favorable effects of ongoing operational improvement efforts and a comparative decline in restructuring charges. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Service $ 13,496 $ 13,333 $ 12,155 $ 1,681 $ 1,836 $ 1,519 Retailing 15,991 15,606 15,064 874 860 785 McLane Company 50,458 49,987 49,775 288 246 299 $ 79,945 $ 78,926 $ 76,994 $ 2,843 $ 2,942 $ 2,603 K-49 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). 2019 versus 2018 Service group revenues were $13.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.2% compared to 2018. Sales of TTI increased 2% in 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency, TTI’s sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. TTI’s sales began to slow in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continued to slow throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower sales prices and the effects of U.S. trade tariffs. Service group revenues in 2019 also reflected increases in aviation-related services (NetJets and to a lesser extent FlightSafety) and the leasing businesses, and decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage, which divested a high revenue, low margin business in mid-2019. The increase in NetJets revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft on lease and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2019 compared to 13.8% in 2018. The comparative declines in earnings in 2019 were primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets. TTI’s earnings decline was attributable to lower gross margin, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses, partly offset by earnings from businesses acquired. FlightSafety’s earnings decline was attributable to significant losses related to an existing government contract that were recorded in the fourth quarter, partly offset by lower training equipment impairment charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the service group were approximately $13.3 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately 9.7% compared to 2017. TTI’s revenues increased approximately 33.7% compared to 2017, reflecting industry-wide increases in demand for electronic components in many geographic markets around the world, the effects of recent business acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. While TTI’s revenue increase in 2018 was significant, revenue growth began to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part attributable to the impact of U.S. trade tariffs. WPLG generated a revenue increase of 20.8% in 2018 over 2017, primarily due to increased political advertising revenue. Revenues of Charter Brokerage increased 53.3%, reflecting increased fees earned and product mix changes. Revenues of the CORT and XTRA leasing businesses increased 8.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased over-the road trailer units on lease and increased furniture rental income. Pre-tax earnings of the service group in 2018 were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 20.9% compared to 2017. The comparative earnings increase was primarily due to TTI, which accounted for almost 84% of the increase. The earnings increase of TTI was primarily due to the effects of the sales volume increases. In addition, XTRA, Charter Brokerage and NetJets each generated increased earnings in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in earnings of these businesses were partly offset by lower earnings at FlightSafety, primarily due to reduced margins from sales of flight simulators and training equipment impairment charges. Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. K-50 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 2019 versus 2018 Retailing group revenues were $16.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.5% compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues in 2019, which represented approximately 64% of our retailing revenues, increased 4.1% over 2018. BHA’s revenue increase reflected an 11.5% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in vehicle finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. Home furnishings group revenues, which represented about 20% of the aggregate retailing group revenues, declined 1.3% in 2019 compared to 2018. Sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations. Retail group pre-tax earnings were $874 million in 2019, an increase of 1.6% over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 22.7%, primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally higher operating expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined 7.9% compared to 2018. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the retailing group were approximately $15.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.6% compared to 2017. BHA’s revenues, which represented approximately 63% of the aggregate retailing revenues, increased 4.0% as compared to 2017. The increase derived primarily from increased pre-owned vehicle sales and service contract revenues. Revenues from new vehicle sales were relatively unchanged. Louis revenues increased 7.8% in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to the translation effects of a weaker average U.S. Dollar. Home furnishings revenues increased 4.7% in 2018 over 2017, reflecting increased sales in certain geographic markets and the effect of a new store. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group were $860 million in 2018, an increase of 9.6% over 2017. The earnings increase included higher earnings from BHA and Louis, partly offset by lower earnings from the home furnishings retailers. The earnings increase of BHA was primarily from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. The earnings increase at Louis reflected the revenue increase and an increase in its operating margin rate. Earnings of the home furnishings businesses declined 2.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, partly due to increased inventory liquidation, delivery and occupancy costs at Star Furniture. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised approximately 66% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2019 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $50.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 0.9% compared to 2018. McLane operates on 52/53-week fiscal year and 2019 included an extra week compared to 2018. Otherwise, revenues in 2019 decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business and increased 3% in the foodservice business as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which were employee costs. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect these operating conditions will continue. K-51 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues were approximately $50.0 billion in 2018, slightly higher than 2017, reflecting a slight increase in grocery sales (1%) and a slight decrease in foodservice sales (1%). The decline in foodservice revenues was primarily due to a net loss of customers. Pre-tax earnings were $246 million, a decline of 17.7%, compared to 2017. McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment, which negatively affected operating results. While gross margin rates increased slightly over 2018, increases in fuel, depreciation and certain other operating expenses more than offset the increase, producing a decline in pre-tax earnings compared to 2017. Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Investment gains (losses) $ 71,123 $ (22,155 ) $ 1,410 Derivative gains (losses) 1,484 (300 ) 718 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 72,607 (22,455 ) 2,128 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 15,162 (4,718 ) 751 Net gains (losses) $ 57,445 $ (17,737 ) $ 1,377 Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 20.8 % 34.9 % Investment gains (losses) Due to a new accounting pronouncement adopted as of January 1, 2018, pre-tax investment gains/losses reported in earnings include unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices on investments in equity securities. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses related to equity securities were generally recorded as the securities were sold, redeemed or exchanged based on the cost of the disposed securities and the unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. While the new accounting pronouncement does not affect our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains and losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to equity securities we held at December 31, 2019. By comparison, we recorded pre-tax investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion in 2018 attributable to unrealized losses with respect to the equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Pre-tax net unrealized gains on equity securities of approximately $29 billion in 2017 was recorded in other comprehensive income. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses on equity securities were recorded when securities were sold based on the cost of the disposed securities. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold during the year, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains (losses) Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2019, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $397 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $968 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of $12.3 billion expired in 2019. K-52 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) (Continued) Derivative gains (losses) (Continued) Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $1.5 billion in 2019 compared to pre-tax losses of $300 million in 2018 and gains of $718 million in 2017. The gains in 2019 and 2017 reflected increases in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations while the losses in 2018 were primarily due to lower equity index values. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Equity method earnings (losses) $ 1,023 $ (1,419 ) $ 1,111 Acquisition accounting expenses (884 ) (1,111 ) (936 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (280 ) (311 ) (266 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 58 289 (655 ) Income tax expense adjustment (377 ) — — Other, principally corporate investment income 884 986 261 Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 424 $ (1,566 ) $ (485 ) After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. After-tax equity method earnings related to our Kraft Heinz investment were earnings of $488 million in 2019, losses of $1,859 million in 2018 and earnings of $972 million in 2017. The after-tax equity method losses in 2018 included approximately $2.7 billion for our share of intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥430 billion par), issued in September 2019, and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion par), issued in June 2019. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustment relates to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds and in January 2020 the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. As a result, we now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized in prior years are not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2019 was $424.8 billion, an increase of $76.1 billion since December 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2019 were $81.4 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $56.3 billion, which were primarily from increases in market prices of the equity securities we owned at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $125.0 billion, which included $101 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $266.7 billion. In August 2019, we paid $10 billion to acquire preferred stock and warrants of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, as discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. K-53 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $19.9 billion, an increase of $3.0 billion since December 31, 2018. In 2019, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of $750 million and issued ¥430 billion of senior notes (approximately $4.0 billion), which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.49% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2049. In March 2020, Berkshire Euro debt of €1.0 billion will mature. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $17.7 billion at December 31, 2019, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $11.0 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In 2019, BHFC repaid $3.95 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049, £1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes due in 2039 and £750 million of 2.625% senior notes due in 2059. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In 2020, BHFC debt of $900 million matures, including $350 million that matured in January. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in 2019 were $11.0 billion and we forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $10.6 billion in 2020. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, relatively unchanged since December 31, 2018. In 2019, BNSF issued $825 million of 3.55% senior unsecured debentures due in 2050 and repaid $750 million of maturing debentures. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $42.6 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.3 billion since December 31, 2018. In 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued debt aggregating $4.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2059 and repaid approximately $1.8 billion of maturing term debt. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. In January 2020, a BHE subsidiary issued $725 million of term debt consisting of $425 million of 2.4% notes due in 2030 and $300 million of 3.125% notes due in 2050. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2019, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial statements, will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. K-54 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Contractual Obligations (Continued) A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table.

(2) Includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts. (3) Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2019 follows. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were approximately $115.5 billion (including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance), of which 84% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2019, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $22.0 billion. Claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable were $20.9 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2019, case development liabilities averaged approximately 30% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. K-55 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2018 increased $42 million during 2019, which produced a corresponding decrease to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2019 reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2019. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $295 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). Property Casualty Total Reported case liabilities $ 5,063 $ 9,665 $ 14,728 IBNR liabilities 4,631 12,825 17,456 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 9,694 22,490 32,184 Reinsurance recoverable 268 852 1,120 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 9,426 $ 21,638 $ 31,064 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the table above consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers. K-56 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2019, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.0 billion for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories: Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses. Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses. Additional Analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. K-57 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications. In 2019, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $150 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. We also reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ events for other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, by $23 million, reflecting lower than expected reported losses. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $850 million, although outcomes of less than $850 million are quite possible given the diversification in worldwide business. Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims were increased approximately $150 million in 2019, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. Our gross unpaid losses, deferred charge assets, and net liabilities at December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions). Gross unpaid losses Deferred charges Liabilities, net of deferred charges $ 42,441 $ (13,747 ) $ 28,694 Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our $42.4 billion estimated liability. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. K-58 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.9 billion at December 31, 2019. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $378 million in 2019, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax losses of $125 million. In 2019, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $909 million with respect to these contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2019, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2020 will approximate $1.2 billion. Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.9 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $19.0 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our review of goodwill includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. Our review of other indefinite-lived intangible assets includes determining an estimated fair value of the asset. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then, as required by GAAP, the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. K-59 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. Fair Value Hypothetical Price Change Estimated Fair Value after Hypothetical Change in Prices Hypothetical Percentage Increase (Decrease) in Shareholders’ Equity (1) December 31, 2019 Investments in equity securities $ 248,027 30% increase $ 319,445 13.3% 30% decrease 176,749 (13.3) Equity index put option contract liabilities 968 30% increase 267 0.1 30% decrease 2,776 (0.3) December 31, 2018 Investments in equity securities $ 172,757 30% increase $ 224,584 11.7% 30% decrease 120,930 (11.7) Equity index put option contract liabilities 2,452 30% increase 1,131 0.3 30% decrease 5,362 (0.7) (1) The hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. K-60 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk (Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2019 and 2018. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses in net earnings related to certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 follows (in millions). 2019 2018 Non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings $ 58 $ 289 Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings (92 ) 207 Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income 257 (1,424 ) K-61 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-63. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February 22, 2020 K-62 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Omaha, Nebraska Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for investments in equity securities (excluding equity method investments) in 2018 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 “Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. K-63 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( “ claim liabilities ” ) under short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are $73,019 million as of December 31, 2019. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities include expected loss and expense ( “ loss ” ) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2019, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others: • We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions. • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by: • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities. • With the assistance of our actuarial specialists: • We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance contracts are $42,441 million as of December 31, 2019. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”), include expected loss expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence. Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2019, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following, among others: • We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities and related assets, including those over the key assumptions. K-64 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities and related assets by: • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities and related assets. • With the assistance of our actuarial specialists: • We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts and related assets, we evaluated the process used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities and related assets. • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessed unexpected development and assessed internal rates of return. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1, 13, and 27 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rate. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. A reporting unit within the Manufacturing reportable segment, which had goodwill at acquisition date of $16,011 million, was an acquisition made by the Company in 2016. This subsidiary also has certain customer relationships that are intangible assets with indefinite lives. These customer relationships are a significant portion of the $18,965 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets the Company reported as of December 31, 2019. The fair values of the reporting unit and customer relationships exceeded their carrying values as of the annual evaluation date; therefore, no impairments were recognized. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit and the customer relationships and the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rates required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and selection of the discount rates for the reporting unit and customer relationships included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the forecasts of future revenue and EBIT. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’ disclosures. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates and discount rates, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and discount rates selected by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Omaha, Nebraska February 22, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1985.

2019 (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (a) Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 27. Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. In particular, estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments (including U.S. Treasury Bills) with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. (d) Investments in fixed maturity securities We classify investments in fixed maturity securities at the acquisition date and re-evaluate the classification at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019, substantially all of our investments in fixed maturity securities were classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. Investment gains and losses for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities are recorded when the securities are sold, as determined on a specific identification basis. If the fair value of a fixed maturity security is less than cost, we evaluate the security for other-than-temporary impairment. We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment if we (a) intend to sell or expect to be required to sell the security before its amortized cost is recovered or (b) do not expect to ultimately recover the amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security. Under scenario (a), we recognize the loss in earnings and under scenario (b), we recognize the credit loss component in earnings and the remainder in other comprehensive income. K-71 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (e) Investments in equity securities We carry substantially all of our investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses. Prior to January 1, 2018, substantially all of our equity security investments were classified as available-for-sale and were also carried at fair value. However, we recorded the periodic changes in fair value of these securities as components of other comprehensive income. In addition, we recorded gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when equity securities were sold (on a specific identification basis) or were other-than-temporarily impaired. (f) Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20 % of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. (g) Receivables Receivables primarily consist of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Allowances for uncollectible balances are provided when it is probable counterparties or customers will be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. (h) Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are predominantly manufactured housing installment loans. We carry these loans at amortized cost, net of allowances for uncollectible accounts, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Substantially all of our loans and finance receivables are secured by real or personal property or by other assets of the borrower. Allowances for credit losses on loans include estimates of losses on loans currently in foreclosure and losses on loans not currently in foreclosure. We estimate losses on loans in foreclosure based on historical experience and collateral recovery rates. Estimates of losses on loans not currently in foreclosure consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates and prevailing economic conditions. Allowances for credit losses also incorporate the historical average time elapsed from the last payment until foreclosure. Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans in the foreclosure process are considered non-performing. Once a loan is in foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. K-72 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (i) Derivatives We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j) Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. (k) Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods acquired for resale, homes constructed for sale, and materials consumed in business operations. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2019, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 37 % of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $ 950 million as of December 31, 2019 and $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. (l) Property, plant and equipment We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend the useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years , machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 41 years . Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years , interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 3 to 30 years . K-73 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment (Continued) We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m) Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from others (“lessee” contracts). We record additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 35 years . We use declining balance deprecation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is relatively greater during the earlier years of its life and maintenance and repair costs increase during the later years. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. (n) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value as of the current testing date. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the current estimated fair value of net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. K-74 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (o) Revenue recognition We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all of the underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Except as described in Note 1(x), our revenue recognition practices for contracts with customers under ASC 606 do not differ significantly from prior practices. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due from the customer within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (o) Revenue recognition (Continued) The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair, and contract incentives which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services, or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution services. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements. These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract termination or upon the customer’s request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts and not ASC 606. The re-characterization of these fractional ownership interests as operating leases did not have a significant effect on our consolidated revenues or earnings. (p) Losses and loss adjustment expenses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) reports of losses from policyholders, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. (q) Retroactive reinsurance contracts We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed under retroactive reinsurance of short duration contracts consistent with other short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts discussed in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (r) Insurance policy acquisition costs We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability, and we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were $ 2,937 million and $ 2,658 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (s) Life and annuity insurance benefits We compute our liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity, and lapse or withdrawal rates as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates generally range from 3 % to 7.5 %. (t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. (u) Foreign currency The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. Gains or losses from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. (v) Income taxes Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is not likely. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (v) Income taxes (Continued) Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. (w) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019 Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with regard to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $ 6.2 billion and lease liabilities of $ 5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $ 300 million. Consequently, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $ 5.9 billion. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases. (x) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2018 On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions). ASU 2016-01 ASU 2018-02 ASC 606 Total Increase (decrease): Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 61,459 ) $ 84 $ — $ ( 61,375 ) Retained earnings 61,459 ( 84 ) ( 70 ) 61,305 Shareholders’ equity — — ( 70 ) ( 70 ) With respect to ASU 2016-01, beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of our equity securities during the period are included within investment gains/losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of January 1, 2018, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified the stranded deferred income tax effects arising from the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2018 to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements. As discussed in Note 1(o), ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts. The principal effects of this re-characterization were to increase equipment held for lease and aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues by approximately $ 3.5 billion. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) (y) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2019 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-13, which together with subsequent FASB amendments, were codified in ASC 326 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses.” ASC 326 provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASC 326 also modifies impairment loss recognition measurement for available-for-sale debt securities. Under existing accounting principles, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. ASC 326 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are adopting ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020 and do not expect its adoption will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and we are adopting ASU 2017-14 as of January 1, 2020. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On October 1, 2018, we acquired Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company (“Medical Liability Mutual”), a writer of medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. At that time, Medical Liability Mutual’s name was changed to MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”). The acquisition price was approximately $ 2.5 billion. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of MLMIC’s assets was approximately $ 6.1 billion, including cash ($ 230 million) and investments ($ 5.2 billion), and the fair value of its liabilities was approximately $ 3.6 billion, consisting primarily of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ($ 3.2 billion). In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-ons” to several of our existing business operations. Aggregate consideration paid for bolt-on acquisitions, net of cash acquired was approximately $ 1.7 billion in 2019, $ 1.0 billion in 2018 and $ 2.7 billion in 2017. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 87 % of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2019 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Amounts are in millions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to early call or prepayment rights held by issuers. Due in one year or less Due after one year through five years Due after five years through ten years Due after ten years Mortgage-backed securities Total Amortized cost $ 6,732 $ 10,203 $ 311 $ 428 $ 399 $ 18,073 Fair value 6,761 10,321 355 789 459 18,685 K-80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (4) Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized based on the primary industry of the investee in the table below (in millions).

On April 30, 2019, Berkshire committed to invest a total of $ 10 billion in connection with Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (“Occidental”) proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”). The Anadarko shareholders approved the acquisition by Occidental on August 8, 2019 and the acquisition and our investment in Occidental closed on August 8, 2019. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding table. Berkshire’s investments in Occidental include newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion, together with warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. ( 5) Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. K-81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (5) Equity method investments (Continued) Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 10.5 billion and $ 14.0 billion, respectively. The carrying value of our investment at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 13.8 billion. We recorded equity method earnings of $ 493 million in 2019, losses of approximately $ 2.7 billion in 2018, and earnings of approximately $ 2.9 billion in 2017. In 2019 and 2018, our equity method earnings/losses included our share of the after-tax intangible asset impairment losses recorded by Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz recorded pre-tax impairment losses of approximately $ 1.9 billion in 2019 and $ 15.9 billion in 2018. In 2017, our equity method earnings included our share of certain one-time effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on Kraft Heinz’s net earnings. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 521 million in 2019, $ 814 million in 2018 and $ 797 million in 2017, which we recorded as reductions in our carrying value. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $ 3.3 billion ( 24 %). In light of that fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline, and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in a future period based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. Summarized financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Assets $ 101,450 $ 103,461 Liabilities 49,701 51,683 Year ending December 28, 2019 Year ending December 29, 2018 Year ending December 30, 2017 Sales $ 24,977 $ 26,268 $ 26,076 Net earnings (losses) attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders $ 1,935 $ ( 10,192 ) $ 10,941 Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $ 3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our equity method earnings in these entities were $ 683 million in 2019, $ 563 million in 2018 and $ 76 million in 2017. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On December 31, 2019, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North America, with more than 28,000 team members, 750 locations across the U.S. and Canada, and more than $ 30 billion in annual revenues. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. K-82 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (6) Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 are summarized below (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Equity securities: Unrealized investment gains/losses on securities held at the end of the period $ 69,581 $ ( 22,729 ) $ — Investment gains/losses during the year on securities sold 1,585 291 — Gross realized gains — — 2,237 Gross realized losses — — ( 919 ) 71,166 ( 22,438 ) 1,318 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 87 480 103 Gross realized losses ( 25 ) ( 227 ) ( 22 ) Other ( 105 ) 30 11 $ 71,123 $ ( 22,155 ) $ 1,410 Prior to 2018, we recognized investment gains and losses in earnings when we sold or otherwise disposed of equity securities based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the cost of the securities and also when we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses. Beginning in 2018, investment gains and losses included in earnings also include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. Prior to 2018, we recorded the changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities in other comprehensive income. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 14.3 billion in 2019 and $ 18.8 billion in 2018 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold during 2019 and 2018 reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold during the year, which are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and our original cost, were $ 3.2 billion in 2019 and $ 3.3 billion in 2018. (7) Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions). December 31, 2019 2018 Loans and finance receivables before allowances and discounts $ 18,199 $ 16,962 Allowances for uncollectible loans ( 167 ) ( 177 ) Unamortized acquisition discounts and points ( 505 ) ( 505 ) $ 17,527 $ 16,280 Loans and finance receivables are predominantly installment loans originated or acquired by our manufactured housing business. Provisions for loan losses for 2019 and 2018 were $ 125 million and $ 141 million, respectively. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $ 135 million in 2019 and $ 144 million in 2018. At December 31, 2019, approximately 98 % of the manufactured housing loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment, with the remainder evaluated individually. As part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At December 31, 2019, we considered approximately 99 % of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 96 % of the loan balances to be current as to payment status. Additionally, in 2018, we entered into an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $ 2.0 billion term loan facility, which matures on July 31, 2023 . As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding loans under the facility were approximately $ 1.6 billion.

Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2020 – $ 1,275 ; 2021 – $ 1,144 ; 2022 – $ 1,082 ; 2023 – $ 993 and 2024 – $ 913 . Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 19.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $ 18.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. (14) Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. Currently, the most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions). Liabilities Notional Value December 31, 2019 $ 968 $ 14,385 December 31, 2018 2,452 26,759 Notional value represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. We recorded derivative contract gains of $ 1,484 million in 2019, losses of $ 300 million in 2018 and gains of $ 718 million in 2017, with respect to our equity index put option contracts. The gains in 2019 were primarily due to increases in equity index values. The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. During 2019, contracts with notional values of approximately $ 12.3 billion expired and substantially all of the remaining contracts will expire by February 2023 . At December 31, 2019, the remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately 1.8 years. We received aggregate premiums of $ 2.5 billion on the remaining contracts at the contract inception dates and we have no counterparty credit risk. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $ 397 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 1,653 million at December 31, 2018. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. K-87 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (14) Derivative contracts (Continued) Our regulated utility subsidiaries may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of their commodity price risks. Most of these net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Derivative contract assets were $ 145 million and $ 172 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Derivative contract liabilities were $ 76 million and $ 111 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 16), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 is as follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Balances – beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 68,458 $ 61,122 $ 53,379 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 3,060 ) ( 3,201 ) ( 3,338 ) Net liabilities 65,398 57,921 50,041 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 43,335 39,876 37,702 Prior accident years’ events ( 752 ) ( 1,406 ) ( 544 ) Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 42,583 38,470 37,158 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 19,482 ) ( 18,391 ) ( 17,425 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 17,642 ) ( 15,452 ) ( 12,507 ) Total payments ( 37,124 ) ( 33,843 ) ( 29,932 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 23 ) ( 331 ) 654 Business acquisition (disposition) ( 670 ) 3,181 — Balances – end of year: Net liabilities 70,164 65,398 57,921 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,855 3,060 3,201 Gross liabilities $ 73,019 $ 68,458 $ 61,122 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the preceding table were recorded in earnings in each period and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Current accident year losses included approximately $ 1.0 billion in 2019, $ 1.6 billion in 2018 and $ 3.0 billion in 2017 from significant catastrophe events occurring in each year. The effects of businesses acquired (or disposed) are included (or excluded) on a retrospective basis for all years presented in the disaggregated accident year incurred and paid loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses data shown in this Note. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 752 million in 2019, $ 1,406 million in 2018 and $ 544 million in 2017, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 1.1 % in 2019, 2.4 % in 2018 and 1.1 % in 2017. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $ 457 million in 2019, $ 937 million in 2018 and $ 249 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated medical professional liability and workers’ compensation losses, partially offset by higher commercial auto and other liability losses. The decreases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to workers’ compensation and medical professional liability claims. Liabilities for prior years’ private passenger auto claims were reduced in 2018 and increased in 2017. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance were reduced $ 295 million in 2019, $ 469 million in 2018 and $ 295 million in 2017. K-88 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated claim liabilities include amounts for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance recoverable, of approximately $ 1.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). GEICO Physical Damage GEICO Auto Liability BH Primary Medical Professional Liability BH Primary Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty BHRG Property BHRG Casualty Total Unpaid losses and ALAE, net $ 321 $ 18,475 $ 7,479 $ 9,568 $ 9,382 $ 21,304 $ 66,529 Reinsurance recoverable — 1,014 54 597 268 852 2,785 Unpaid unallocated loss adjustment expenses 2,367 Other unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,338 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 73,019 GEICO GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing an individual case reserve when we have insufficient time or information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish liability case loss estimates, which include loss adjustment expenses, once the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain than for physical damage coverages primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K-89 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) GEICO’s incurred and paid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance, are summarized by accident year below for physical damage and auto liability claims. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2019. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all policy coverages and excludes projected IBNR claims. Dollars are in millions.

Incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2019. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. BH Primary Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the paid and incurred development method, Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, hindsight outstanding severity method, trended severity method and trended pure premium method. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. Periodically, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

We use certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates. K-92 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 5 ) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Case and IBNR liability estimates for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. Incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year, net of reinsurance. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2019. Dollars are in millions.

Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances – beginning of year $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) $ 42,937 $ ( 15,278 ) $ 24,972 $ ( 8,047 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Current year contracts 1,138 ( 453 ) 603 ( 86 ) 19,005 ( 7,730 ) Prior years’ contracts 378 810 ( 341 ) 1,260 ( 41 ) 499 Total 1,516 357 262 1,174 18,964 ( 7,231 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 909 ) — ( 1,365 ) — ( 999 ) — Balances – end of year $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) $ 42,937 $ ( 15,278 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 1,873 $ 1,436 $ 11,733 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value. In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”) to indemnify AIG for 80 % of up to $ 25 billion of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of $ 25 billion retained by AIG, with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring prior to 2016. At the inception of the contract, we recorded premiums earned of $ 10.2 billion, and we also recorded a liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $ 16.4 billion and a deferred charge reinsurance assumed asset of $ 6.2 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we increased our estimated ultimate claim liabilities under the aforementioned AIG contract by approximately $ 1.8 billion based on higher than expected loss payments reported by AIG under the contractual retention. We also increased the related deferred charge asset by $ 1.7 billion based on our re-estimation of the amounts and timing of future claim payments. The estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract were approximately $ 18.2 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the related deferred charge assets were approximately $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 6.9 billion at December 31, 2018. K-95 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 6 ) Retroactive reinsurance contracts (Continued) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $ 1,188 million in 2019, $ 919 million in 2018 and $ 458 million in 2017, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes. Our retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $ 12.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 13.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.

The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of December 31, 2019.

Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. During 2019, BHFC repaid $ 3.95 billion of maturing senior notes. In 2019, BHFC issued $ 2.0 billion of 4.25 % senior notes due in 2049 and £ 1.75 billion of senior notes consisting of £ 1.0 billion of 2.375 % senior notes due in 2039 and £ 750 million of 2.625 % senior notes due in 2059 . Such borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. The carrying values of our non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 430 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 192 million in 2019 and $ 366 million in 2018 and losses of $ 990 million in 2017. K-96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 7 ) Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In addition to BHFC borrowings, at December 31, 2019, Berkshire has guaranteed approximately $ 1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $ 4.6 billion of long-term debt, with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2059 and with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6 %. In January 2020, a BHE subsidiary issued $ 725 million of term debt consisting of $ 425 million of 2.4 % notes due in 2030 and $ 300 million of 3.125 % notes due in 2050 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In July 2019, BNSF issued $ 825 million of 3.55 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2050 . As of December 31, 2019, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 7.1 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 5.6 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the statutory U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA also provided for a one-time tax on certain accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Further, the TCJA includes provisions that, in certain instances, impose U.S. income tax liabilities on earnings of foreign subsidiaries and limit the deductibility of interest expenses. The TCJA also provides for accelerated deductions of certain capital expenditures made after September 27, 2017 through bonus depreciation. In 2017, upon the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded a reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $ 35.6 billion for the effect of the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $ 29.6 billion and we increased regulatory liabilities of our regulated utility subsidiaries by approximately $ 6.0 billion for the portion of the deferred income tax liability reduction that we will be required to, effectively, refund to customers in the rate setting process. We also recognized an income tax charge of approximately $ 1.4 billion with respect to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Thus, upon the enactment of the TCJA, we included a net income tax benefit in our 2017 earnings of approximately $ 28.2 billion. In 2018, we reduced our estimate of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries and recognized additional deferred income tax rate change effects. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are shown below (in millions).

Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes. Income tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 is as follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Federal $ 19,069 $ ( 1,613 ) $ ( 23,427 ) State 625 175 894 Foreign 1,210 1,117 1,018 $ 20,904 $ ( 321 ) $ ( 21,515 ) Current $ 5,818 $ 5,176 $ 3,299 Deferred 15,086 ( 5,497 ) ( 24,814 ) $ 20,904 $ ( 321 ) $ ( 21,515 ) K-98 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1 8 ) Income taxes (Continued) Income tax expense is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 in the table below (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Earnings before income taxes $ 102,696 $ 4,001 $ 23,838 Hypothetical income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ 21,566 $ 840 $ 8,343 Dividends received deduction and tax-exempt interest ( 433 ) ( 393 ) ( 905 ) State income taxes, less U.S. federal income tax benefit 494 138 465 Foreign tax rate differences ( 6 ) 271 ( 339 ) U.S. income tax credits ( 942 ) ( 711 ) ( 636 ) Net benefit from the enactment of the TCJA — ( 302 ) ( 28,200 ) Other differences, net 225 ( 164 ) ( 243 ) $ 20,904 $ ( 321 ) $ ( 21,515 ) We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011. The IRS is auditing Berkshire’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2020. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, net unrecognized tax benefits were $ 952 million and $ 549 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2019, were $ 795 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. In 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $ 377 million for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. As of December 31, 2019, we do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. ( 19 ) Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $ 21 billion as ordinary dividends during 2020. Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $ 216 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 162 billion at December 31, 2018. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and the carrying values of non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes. K-99 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 0 ) Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

K-100 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 0 ) Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 follow (in millions). Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities Net derivative contract liabilities Balance December 31, 2016 $ 17,321 $ ( 2,824 ) Gains (losses) included in: Earnings — 888 Other comprehensive income 1,157 ( 3 ) Regulatory assets and liabilities — ( 1 ) Dispositions and settlements ( 59 ) ( 129 ) Transfers into/out of Level 3 ( 18,413 ) — Balance December 31, 2017 6 ( 2,069 ) Gains (losses) included in: Earnings — ( 118 ) Other comprehensive income — 2 Regulatory assets and liabilities — 3 Acquisitions 2 3 Dispositions and settlements ( 1 ) ( 164 ) Balance December 31, 2018 7 ( 2,343 ) Gains (losses) included in: Earnings 404 1,972 Other comprehensive income — ( 1 ) Regulatory assets and liabilities — ( 26 ) Acquisitions 10,000 6 Dispositions and settlements ( 4 ) ( 465 ) Balance December 31, 2019 $ 10,407 $ ( 857 ) K-101 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 0 ) Fair value measurements (Continued) We acquired investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidental common stock warrants in August 2019 at an aggregate cost of $ 10 billion. We currently consider the fair value measurements to contain Level 3 inputs. See Note 4. We acquired preferred stock and common stock warrants of Bank of America Corporation (“BAC”) in 2011. We exercised the BAC warrants to acquire BAC common stock in August 2017. As payment of the cost to acquire the BAC common stock, we surrendered substantially all of the BAC preferred stock. Additionally, in December 2017, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (“RBI”) redeemed a $ 3 billion private placement security that we acquired in 2014. During 2017, we concluded the Level 3 inputs used in the previous fair value determinations of the BAC warrants, BAC preferred stock and RBI investments were not significant and we transferred these measurements from Level 3 to Level 2. Quantitative information as of December 31, 2019, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stock $ 10,314 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 10 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 375 basis points Common stock warrants 90 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 10 years Volatility 26 % Derivative contract liabilities 968 Option pricing model Volatility 16 % Investments in equity securities at December 31, 2019 included the Occidental Preferred and common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment. The Occidental Preferred is redeemable at Occidental’s option beginning in 2029. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the Occidental Preferred has a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments. In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. The Occidental common stock warrants expire on the one-year anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding. Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Given the current index values, remaining contract durations and applicable strike prices for these contracts, we believe the only significant model input after December 31, 2019 is the prevailing index price, which is observable. K-102 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (2 1 ) Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the three years ending December 31, 2019 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 1,640,929 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues which are not within the scope of ASC 606. 2019 Manufacturing McLane Company Service and Retail BNSF Berkshire Hathaway Energy Insurance, Corporate and other Total Manufactured products: Industrial and commercial products $ 25,311 $ — $ 184 $ — $ — $ — $ 25,495 Building products 15,620 — — — — — 15,620 Consumer products 14,120 — — — — — 14,120 Grocery and convenience store distribution — 33,057 — — — — 33,057 Food and beverage distribution — 16,767 — — — — 16,767 Auto sales — — 8,481 — — — 8,481 Other retail and wholesale distribution 2,299 — 12,213 — — — 14,512 Service 1,642 539 4,062 23,302 4,096 — 33,641 Electricity and natural gas — — — — 14,819 — 14,819 Total 58,992 50,363 24,940 23,302 18,915 — 176,512 Other revenue 3,632 95 4,459 55 1,181 68,682 78,104 $ 62,624 $ 50,458 $ 29,399 $ 23,357 $ 20,096 $ 68,682 $ 254,616 2018 Manufacturing McLane Company Service and Retail BNSF Berkshire Hathaway Energy Insurance, Corporate and other Total Manufactured products: Industrial and commercial products $ 25,707 $ — $ 204 $ — $ — $ — $ 25,911 Building products 14,323 — — — — — 14,323 Consumer products 14,790 — — — — — 14,790 Grocery and convenience store distribution — 33,518 — — — — 33,518 Food and beverage distribution — 16,309 — — — — 16,309 Auto sales — — 8,181 — — — 8,181 Other retail and wholesale distribution 2,091 — 12,067 — — — 14,158 Service 1,519 84 4,100 23,652 3,949 — 33,304 Electricity and natural gas — — — — 14,951 — 14,951 Total 58,430 49,911 24,552 23,652 18,900 — 175,445 Other revenue 3,340 76 4,297 51 1,070 63,558 72,392 $ 61,770 $ 49,987 $ 28,849 $ 23,703 $ 19,970 $ 63,558 $ 247,837 A summary of the transaction price allocated to the significant unsatisfied remaining performance obligations relating to contracts with expected durations in excess of one year as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).

Benefits under the plans are generally based on years of service and compensation, although benefits under certain plans are based on years of service and fixed benefit rates. Our subsidiaries may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements and may also make discretionary contributions. The components of our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions). 2019 2018 2017 Service cost $ 224 $ 271 $ 273 Interest cost 618 593 635 Expected return on plan assets ( 936 ) ( 988 ) ( 939 ) Amortization of actuarial losses and other 26 188 157 Net periodic pension expense $ ( 68 ) $ 64 $ 126 The accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based on service and compensation prior to the valuation date. The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBOs of such plans were approximately $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reconciliations of the changes in plan assets and PBOs related to BHE’s pension plans and all other pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2019 are in the following tables (in millions).

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change as a result of changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected invested asset returns over a period of several years. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates. A reconciliation of the pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to defined benefit pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2019 follows (in millions). 2019 2018 Balance beginning of year $ ( 1,184 ) $ ( 614 ) Amount included in net periodic pension expense 94 116 Actuarial gains (losses) and other ( 806 ) ( 686 ) Balance end of year $ ( 1,896 ) $ ( 1,184 ) Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans. Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by management. Employer contributions expensed with respect to our defined contribution plans were $ 1,233 million in 2019, $ 1,009 million in 2018 and $ 1,001 million in 2017. K-107 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (26) Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their businesses. As of December 31, 2019, estimated future payments under such arrangements were as follows: $ 15.7 billion in 2020, $ 5.6 billion in 2021, $ 3.7 billion in 2022, $ 2.8 billion in 2023, $ 2.6 billion in 2024 and $ 19.7 billion after 2024. The most significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our fractional aircraft ownership business. Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be obligated to acquire their equity interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2019, we estimate the cost would have been approximately $ 5.4 billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners. (27) Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses, amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.

In 2019, the Parent Company issued ¥ 430.0 billion of senior notes with various maturities and interest rates. See Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For each of the three years ending December 31, 2019, Parent Company borrowings also included € 6.85 billion senior notes. The gains and losses from the periodic remeasurement of these non-U.S. Dollar denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are included in earnings. Parent Company debt maturities over the next five years are as follows: 2020—$ 1,122 million; 2021—$ 2,117 million; 2022—$ 613 million; 2023—$ 3,958 million and 2024—$ 2,120 million. At December 31, 2019, Parent Company guarantees of debt obligations of certain of its subsidiaries were approximately $ 12.2 billion. Such guarantees are an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations. Parent Company has also provided guarantees in connection with equity index put option contracts and certain retroactive reinsurance contracts of subsidiaries. The amounts of subsidiary payments under these contracts, if any, is contingent upon the outcome of future events. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted, which reduced the Parent Company’s income tax expense in 2017 by $ 550 million, primarily due to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities attributable to the lower U.S. statutory rate, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense on certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

(Berkshire, Company or Registrant) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates a large number of other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshires operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshires corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshires corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshires corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate tone at the top messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employ approximately 389,000 people worldwide. Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshires insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance entities. Berkshires insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty and life, accident and health risks worldwide. In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or retention. Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. Insurers based in the United States (U.S.) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a companys authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as excess and surplus lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured partys direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. K-1 The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurers state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. Berkshires insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshires U.S. based insurers was approximately $162 billion at December 31, 2018. Berkshires major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poors and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (Program) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2020 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (the 2015 TRIA Reauthorization). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying acts of terrorism. Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $180 million in 2019 and $200 million in 2020, or any calendar year thereafter. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. During 2019, in the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 81% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance groups deductible. Under the 2015 TRIA Reauthorization, the federal governments reimbursement obligation will be reduced to 80% in 2020 and thereafter. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2019 for Berkshires insurance group is expected to approximate $1.3 billion. There is also an aggregate limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. Regulation of the insurance industry outside of the United States is subject to the laws and regulations of each country in which an insurer has operations or writes premiums. Some jurisdictions impose comprehensive regulatory requirements on insurance businesses, such as in the United Kingdom, where insurers are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in Germany where insurers are subject to regulation by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and in Australia where insurers are subject to regulation by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. Other jurisdictions may impose fewer requirements. In certain foreign countries, reinsurers are also required to be licensed by governmental authorities. These licenses may be subject to modification, suspension or revocation dependent on such factors as amount and types of insurance liabilities and minimum capital and solvency tests. The violation of regulatory requirements may result in fines, censures and/or criminal sanctions in various jurisdictions. Berkshires insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long periods of time (creating float, see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include investment income earned from investments. Berkshires insurance businesses employ approximately 49,000 people. Additional information related to each of Berkshires underwriting groups follows. K-2 GEICO GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICOs insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also insures motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, boat, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. GEICOs marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate (including Esurance), Progressive and USAA. Significant advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 35% over the past five years. According to most recently published A.M. Best data for 2017, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2017 of approximately 56%, with GEICOs market share being second largest at approximately 12.8%. Since the publication of that data, GEICOs management estimates its current market share is approximately 13.3%. Seasonal variations in GEICOs insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICOs cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO is a material asset and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Berkshires combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. Reinsurance business is written through National Indemnity Company (NICO), domiciled in Nebraska, its subsidiaries and various other insurance subsidiaries wholly owned by Berkshire (collectively, the NICO Group) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the General Re Group). BHRGs underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. BHRG also conducts business activities globally in 23 countries. The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. Property/casualty The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks for clients worldwide. The NICO Group periodically participates in underwriting placements with major brokers in the London Market through Berkshire Hathaway Insurance International, Ltd., based in Great Britain. Business is written through intermediary brokers or directly with the insured or reinsured. NICO also occasionally writes retroactive reinsurance contracts, which cover past loss events arising from property and casualty contracts written by ceding insurers and reinsurers. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Groups annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 10-year, 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (IAG) that became effective July 1, 2015. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia Pacific countries. The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (GRC), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. K-3 In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. General Re Groups international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG (GRAG), based in Cologne Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in 23 countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyds of London, and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable immediately after the inception of the contract. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification and are occasionally exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. For instance, in January 2017, NICO entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, AIG). Under the agreement, NICO agreed to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion in excess of $25 billion retained by AIG, of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring in years prior to 2016. The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms, since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. Life/health The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. In 2018, the General Re Group wrote approximately 29% of life/health net premiums in the United States, 20% in Western Europe and the remaining 51% throughout the rest of the world. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (BHLN), a subsidiary of NICO, writes reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures. BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit coverages on closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts. Periodic payment annuity BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies, generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers compensation cases of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Similar to retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in establishing such premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) is a collection of independently managed primary insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below. NICO and certain affiliates (NICO Primary) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC) is a group of insurers offering workers compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has developed a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska. K-4 Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BH Specialty) provides commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional lines, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowners insurance. BH Specialty writes business on both an excess and surplus lines basis and an admitted basis in the U.S., and on a locally admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several cities in the U.S. and international offices located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia and Europe. BH Specialty currently intends to further expand its operations. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents. MedPro Group (MedPro) is a leading provider of customized healthcare liability insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities in the United States. MedPro has provided insurance coverage to protect healthcare providers against losses since 1899. MedPro distributes policies primarily through a nationwide network of appointed agents and brokers. MedPro currently offers coverage options to healthcare providers in the other countries as well as student health insurance, through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. U.S. Investment Corporation (USIC) and its subsidiaries are specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines insurance on an admitted basis, as well as an excess and surplus basis. USIC markets policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USIC companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USIC is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (Applied) is a provider of payroll and insurance services to small and mid-sized employers. Applied, through its subsidiaries principally markets a product that bundles workers compensation and other employment related insurance coverages and business services into a seamless package that is designed to remove the burden of administrative and regulatory requirements faced by small to mid-sized employers. Applied is based in Omaha, Nebraska. The Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (Guard) provide workers compensation business owners policy and commercial umbrella coverage to over 250,000 small and mid-sized businesses. Guard also provides complementary commercial auto and professional liability in an expanding number of states. Policies are offered through independent agents and brokers. Guard is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Central States Indemnity Company of Omaha, based in Omaha, Nebraska, primarily writes Medicare Supplement insurance and credit insurance. On October 1, 2018, NICO acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (MLMIC). MLMIC has been the leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes its policies on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. Investments of insurance businesses Berkshires insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshires Chief Executive Officer and other in-house investment managers. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (float). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $73 billion at the end of 2012 to approximately $123 billion at the end of 2018, primarily through internal growth. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. Over the past five years, with the exception of 2017, Berkshires cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains. The cost of average float in 2017 was approximately 3%, primarily attributable to sizable catastrophe losses and foreign currency exchange rate losses relating to non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities. Railroad BusinessBurlington Northern Santa Fe Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF had approximately 45,000 employees at the end of 2018. In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues of BNSF are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or quotations offered by BNSF. BNSFs financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. K-5 BNSFs primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December 31, 2018, approximately 35% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 26% from industrial products, 21% from agricultural products and 18% from coal. Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all of its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSFs business. The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. Environmental Matters BNSFs rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSFs land holdings are or were used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF is subject to, and will from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liabilities for the cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, BNSF may be responsible under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by BNSF, its current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSFs primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF. Other BNSF Logistics, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNSF, provides non-asset based logistics services to third parties. BNSF Logistics services include transportation strategy and execution, managed transportation services, supply chain consulting, project management, engineering, reverse logistics, warehousing and cross-docking, and customs house brokerage services.

(NV Energy) is an energy holding company headquartered in Nevada, primarily consisting of two regulated utility subsidiaries, Nevada Power Company (Nevada Power) and Sierra Pacific Power Company (Sierra Pacific) (collectively, the Nevada Utilities). Nevada Power serves retail electric customers in southern Nevada and Sierra Pacific serves retail electric and natural gas customers in northern Nevada. The Nevada Utilities combined service territorys economy includes gaming, mining, recreation, warehousing, manufacturing and governmental services. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, the Nevada Utilities sell electricity and natural gas on a wholesale basis. As vertically integrated utilities, BHEs domestic utilities own approximately 29,000 net megawatts of generation capacity in operation and under construction. The domestic utilities business is subject to seasonal variations principally related to the use of electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating. Typically, regulated electric revenues are higher in the summer months, while regulated natural gas revenues are higher in the winter months. The Great Britain distribution companies consist of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, which own a substantial electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England in an area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. The distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated tariffs for the use of their distribution systems. BHE acquired AltaLink L.P. (AltaLink) on December 1, 2014. AltaLink is a regulated electric transmission-only utility company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. AltaLink connects generation plants to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory. The natural gas pipelines consist of Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern Natural) and Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River). Northern Natural, based in Nebraska, owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States, as measured by pipeline miles, reaching from west Texas to Michigans Upper Peninsula. Northern Naturals pipeline system consists of approximately 14,700 miles of natural gas pipelines. Northern Naturals extensive pipeline system, which is interconnected with many interstate and intrastate pipelines in the national grid system, has access to supplies from multiple major supply basins and provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. Northern Natural also operates three underground natural gas storage facilities and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units. Northern Naturals pipeline system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand typically occurring during the months of November through March. K-7 Kern River, based in Utah, owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that consists of approximately 1,700 miles and extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. BHE Renewables is based in Iowa and owns interests in independent power projects having approximately 4,700 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Hawaii and the Philippines. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, BHE Renewables has invested approximately $2 billion in eleven wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Regulatory Matters PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.2 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. With certain limited exceptions, BHEs domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utilitys reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission and distribution-only services. Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023. AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLinks activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is the independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Albertas integrated electrical system (AIES) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service and (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency within the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. K-8 Environmental Matters BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nations air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHEs generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force November 4, 2016. Supporting the United States commitment under the Paris Agreement was the Clean Power Plan, which was finalized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in August 2015. The Clean Power Plan established the Best System of Emission Reduction for fossil-fueled power plants to include: (a) heat rate improvements; (b) increased utilization of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities; and (c) increased deployment of new and incremental non-carbon generation placed in service after 2012. The final Clean Power Plan compliance obligations were scheduled to begin in 2022, and extend through 2030. When fully implemented, the rule was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would begin the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, withdrawal cannot occur until four years after entry into force, making the United States withdrawal effective in November 2020. The EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan on October 10, 2017, which has not yet been finalized. On August 21, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which would replace the Clean Power Plan. The Affordable Clean Energy rule would determine that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and proposes a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. The EPA received comments on the proposal through October 2018 and anticipates finishing the rule in spring 2019. The full impacts of the EPAs recent efforts to repeal and replace the Clean Power Plan are not expected to have a material impact on BHE and its energy subsidiaries. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy. BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, through December 31, 2018, BHEs cumulative investment in wind, solar, geothermal and biomass generation is approximately $25 billion. Non-Energy Businesses HomeServices of America, Inc.

Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. K-10 PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. A number of raw materials in its products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their work forces, and/or unstable governments in exporting nations and inflation.

Union Tank Car Company (UTLX) is the largest component of Rail Products and Services and is a leading designer, builder, and full-service lessor of railroad tank cars and other specialized railcars. Together with its Canadian affiliate Procor, UTLX owns a fleet of approximately 130,000 railcars for lease to customers in chemical, petrochemical, energy, and agricultural/food industries. UTLX manufactures tank cars at two U.S. plants and performs railcar maintenance services at more than 100 locations across North America. UTLX has a diversified customer base, both geographically and across industries. UTLX, while subject to cyclicality and significant competition in most of its markets, competes by offering a broad range of high-quality products and services targeted at its niche markets. Railcars are typically leased for multiple-year terms and most of the leases are renewed upon expiration. Due to selective ongoing capital investment, utilization rates (the number of railcars on lease to total available) of the railcar fleet are generally high. Following the downturn of oil and gas markets in recent years, renewal rental rates have declined for some railcar types and has resulted in a decline in utilization, which has had a meaningful impact on UTLXs results. While tank car specifications are highly regulated in North America, regulatory changes are not expected to materially affect UTLXs operating results, competitive position, or financial strength. Intermodal Containers leases intermodal tank containers through EXSIF Worldwide. EXSIF is a leading international lessor of intermodal tank containers with a fleet of approximately 60,000 units, primarily serving chemical producers and logistics operators.

CTB competes with a variety of manufacturers and suppliers, many of which offer only a limited number of the products offered by CTB and two of which offer products across many of CTBs product lines. Competition is based on the price, value, reputation, quality and design of the products offered and the customer service provided by distributors, dealers and manufacturers of the products. CTBs leading brand names, distribution network, diversified product line, product support and high-quality products enable it to compete effectively. CTB manufactures its products primarily from galvanized steel, steel wire, stainless steel and polymer materials and supplies of these materials have been sufficient in recent years.

Shaws seven carpet, seven hard surface and two sample full-service distribution facilities and 26 redistribution centers, along with centralized management information systems, enable it to provide prompt and efficient delivery of its products to both its retail customers and wholesale distributors. Substantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester. In the tufting process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic backing, forming loops, which may be cut or left uncut, depending on the desired texture or construction. During 2018, Shaw processed approximately 95% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials continues to be good but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers. The floor covering industry is highly competitive with more than 100 companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of carpet in the United States and numerous manufacturers engaged in hard surface floor covering production and sales. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 50% of the total United States consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality, style, price and service.

JM serves markets that include building, flooring, interiors, aerospace, automotive and transportation, air handling, appliance, HVAC, pipe insulation, filtration, waterproofing and wind energy. Fiberglass is the basic material in a majority of JMs products, although JM also manufactures a significant portion of its products with other materials to satisfy the broader needs of its customers. Raw materials are readily available in sufficient quantities from various sources for JM to maintain and expand its current production levels. JM regards its patents and licenses as valuable, however it does not consider any of its businesses to be materially dependent on any single patent or license. JM is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and operates 43 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and China and conducts research and development at its technical center in Littleton, Colorado and at other facilities in the U.S. and Europe. Fiberglass is made from earthen raw materials and recycled glass, together with proprietary organic and acrylic-based formaldehyde-free agents to bind many of its glass fibers. JMs products also contain materials other than fiberglass, including various chemical and petro-chemical-based materials used in roofing and other specialized products. JM uses recycled material when available and suitable to satisfy the broader needs of its customers. The raw materials used in these various products are readily available in sufficient quantities from various sources to maintain and expand its current production levels. JMs operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. The most relevant of the federal laws are the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which are administered by the EPA. In 2015, the EPA revised the hazardous air pollutant rules for the wool fiberglass and mineral wool manufacturing industries, which were further revised in 2017. While the new rules implement new emission standards, they are not expected to require material expenditures to meet the compliance dates in 2020. JM sells its products through a wide variety of channels including contractors, distributors, retailers, manufacturers and fabricators. JM operates in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised primarily of several large global and national manufacturers and smaller regional manufacturers. JM holds leadership positions in the key markets that it serves. JMs products compete primarily on value, differentiation and customization, and breadth of product line. Sales of JMs products are moderately seasonal due to increases in construction activity that typically occur in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. JM sees a marketplace trend in customer purchasing decisions being influenced by the sustainable and energy efficient attributes of its products, services and operations. MiTek Industries, Inc.

Within the sectors, the business will be further managed based on market channels or product categories. The reorganization is expected to provide customers with more targeted solutions and produce a more simplified, efficient and better-integrated organizational structure.

The demand for Acmes products is seasonal, with higher sales in the warmer weather months, and is subject to the level of construction activity, which is cyclical. Acme also owns and leases properties and mineral rights that supply raw materials used in many of its manufactured products. Acmes raw materials supply is believed to be adequate. The brick industry is subject to the EPAs Maximum Achievable Control Technology Rule (MACT Rule) finalized in October of 2015 with a deadline for compliance of December 31, 2018. Key elements of the MACT Rule include emission limits established for certain hazardous air pollutants and acidic gases.

Additionally in 2015, FOL entered into an eight year agreement with one key supplier to provide the majority of FOLs yarn. Management currently believes there are readily available alternative sources of raw materials and yarn. However, if relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources of supply, production could be adversely affected, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on results of operations. Additionally, raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. FOL has secured contracts to purchase cotton, either directly or through the yarn suppliers, to meet the majority of its production plans for 2019. FOLs markets are highly competitive, consisting of many domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors. Competition is generally based upon product features, quality, customer service and price.

Information regarding each of these operations follows. Berkshires retailing businesses employ approximately 29,000 people. Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Berkshire acquired a group of affiliated companies referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Group, Inc. (BHA) in 2015. BHA is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 108 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 29 collision service centers directly connected to the dealerships operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company. Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 70% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHAs annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. BHAs overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of BHAs dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHAs ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. K-20 Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturers brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturers trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with good cause under the applicable state franchise law. BHA owns facilities with approximately 6.5 million square feet of space and approximately 950 acres of land that are utilized in its operations. BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHAs dealerships and third party dealerships.

Risk Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as we, us, our or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 88, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 95. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshires Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire subsidiary managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Boards succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshires Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshires non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshires insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions. K-22 We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. Investments are unusually concentrated and fair values are subject to loss in value. We concentrate a high percentage of the investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities and diversify our investment portfolios far less than is conventional in the insurance industry. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders equity and our consolidated statement of earnings. Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in their statutory surplus. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits. Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures, and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses. A successful (as defined by the aggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. K-23 Cyber security risks We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users, and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Cyber attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber attacks, or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses. Derivative contracts may require significant cash settlement payments and result in significant losses in the future. Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts. The contracts remaining at year end 2018 will expire from 2019 through 2025. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in settlement payments that significantly exceed the year end 2018 intrinsic value of the contracts ($1.7 billion), recorded fair value ($2.45 billion) or the premiums we received at inception ($4.0 billion). Risks unique to our regulated businesses Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single event. We may also write coverages for losses arising from acts of terrorism. We attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently, we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, losses may aggregate in unanticipated ways. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period. The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses. The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($110 billion at December 31, 2018), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance companies may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. K-24 Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSFs business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. For example, enacted federal legislation mandated the implementation of positive train control (PTC) technology by December 31, 2018, on certain mainline track where inter-city and commuter passenger railroads operate and where toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) hazardous materials are transported. Due to the Federal Railroad Administrations (FRA) interpretation of the PTC mandate as requiring all railroads that run on our tracks to be compliant before we can be deemed compliant, the FRA has confirmed an extension of the deadline for the Company to December 31, 2020. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport TIH chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSFs ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit managements ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; transacting between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements are funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of these businesses. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Description of Properties The properties used by Berkshires business segments are summarized in this section. Berkshires railroad and utilities and energy businesses, in particular, utilize considerable physical assets in their businesses. Railroad BusinessBurlington Northern Santa Fe Through BNSF Railway, BNSF operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track (excluding multiple main tracks, yard tracks and sidings) in 28 states, and also operates in three Canadian provinces.

BNSF owns or holds under non-cancelable leases exceeding one year approximately 8,000 locomotives and 70,000 freight cars, in addition to maintenance of way and other equipment. In the ordinary course of business, BNSF makes significant capital investments to expand and improve its railroad network. BNSF incurs significant costs in repairing and maintaining its properties. In 2018, BNSF recorded approximately $2 billion in repairs and maintenance expense. Utilities and Energy BusinessesBerkshire Hathaway Energy BHEs energy properties consist of the physical assets necessary to support its electricity and natural gas businesses. Properties of BHEs electricity businesses include electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as coal mining assets that support certain of BHEs electric generating facilities. Properties of BHEs natural gas businesses include natural gas distribution facilities, interstate pipelines, storage facilities, compressor stations and meter stations. The transmission and distribution assets are primarily within each of BHEs utility service territories. In addition to these physical assets, BHE has rights-of-way, mineral rights and water rights that enable BHE to utilize its facilities. Pursuant to separate financing agreements, a majority of these properties are pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise provide the security for the related subsidiary debt. BHE or its affiliates own or have interests in the following types of electric generating facilities at December 31, 2018: Energy Source Entity Location by Significance Natural gas Coal Wind Solar Hydroelectric Nuclear Geothermal Total Facility Net Capacity (MW) represents the lesser of nominal ratings or any limitations under applicable interconnection, power purchase, or other agreements for intermittent resources and the total net dependable capability available during summer conditions for all other units. An intermittent resources nominal rating is the manufacturers contractually specified capability (in MW) under specified conditions. Net Owned Capacity indicates BHEs ownership of Facility Net Capacity. As of December 31, 2018, BHEs subsidiaries also have electric generating facilities that are under construction in Iowa and Wyoming having total Facility Net Capacity and Net Owned Capacity of 2,390 MW. PacifiCorp, MEC and NV Energy own electric transmission and distribution systems, including approximately 24,800 miles of transmission lines and approximately 1,690 substations, gas distribution facilities, including approximately 27,400 miles of gas mains and service lines, and an estimated 25 million tons of recoverable coal reserves in mines owned or leased in Wyoming and Colorado. The electricity distribution network of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) includes approximately 17,400 miles of overhead lines, approximately 42,300 miles of underground cables and approximately 780 major substations. AltaLinks electricity transmission system includes approximately 8,200 miles of transmission lines and approximately 310 substations. K-26 Northern Naturals pipeline system consists of approximately 14,700 miles of natural gas pipelines, including approximately 6,300 miles of mainline transmission pipelines and approximately 8,400 miles of branch and lateral pipelines. Northern Naturals end-use and distribution market area includes points in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan and Illinois and its natural gas supply and delivery service area includes points in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Storage services are provided through the operation of one underground natural gas storage field in Iowa, two underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units, one in Iowa and one in Minnesota. Kern Rivers system consists of approximately 1,700 miles of natural gas pipelines, including approximately 1,400 miles of mainline section, including 100 miles of lateral pipelines, and approximately 300 miles of common facilities. Kern River owns the entire mainline section, which extends from the systems point of origination in Wyoming through the Central Rocky Mountains into California. Other Segments The physical properties used by Berkshires other significant business segments are summarized below: Business Country Locations Property/Facility type Insurance: GEICO BHRG BH Primary Manufacturing Service McLane Company Retailing K-27 Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Mine Safety Disclosures Information regarding the Companys mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503 (a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K. Executive Officers of the Registrant Following is a list of the Registrants named executive officers: Name Position with Registrant Warren E. Buffett Charles T. Munger Gregory E. Abel Ajit Jain Marc D. Hamburg Each executive officer serves, in accordance with the by-laws of the Registrant, until the first meeting of the Board of Directors following the next annual meeting of shareholders and until a successor is chosen and qualified or until such executive officer sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. K-28 Part II Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Security Holder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Berkshires Class A and Class B common stock are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbol: BRK.A and BRK.B, respectively. Shareholders Berkshire had approximately 2,000 record holders of its Class A common stock and 19,500 record holders of its Class B common stock at February 15, 2019. Record owners included nominees holding at least 417,000 shares of Class A common stock and 1,374,000,000 shares of Class B common stock on behalf of beneficial-but-not-of-record owners. Dividends Berkshire has not declared a cash dividend since 1967. Common Stock Repurchase Program For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshires Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshires Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshires intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshires Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2018 follows. Period October 11 through October 18: Class A common stock Class B common stock December 13 through December 24: Class A common stock The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshires consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion. K-29 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Security Holder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (Continued) Stock Performance Graph The following chart compares the subsequent value of $100 invested in Berkshire common stock on December 31, 2013 with a similar investment in the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and in the Standard & Poors Property  Casualty Insurance Index.** Cumulative return for the Standard & Poors indices based on reinvestment of dividends. It would be difficult to develop a peer group of companies similar to Berkshire. The Corporation owns subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities of which the most important is the property and casualty insurance business and, accordingly, management has used the Standard & Poors PropertyCasualty Insurance Index for comparative purposes.

Insurance  underwriting Insurance  investment income Railroad Utilities and energy Manufacturing, service and retailing Investment and derivative gains/losses Other Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 26 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities. These gains and losses are likely to be very significant given the size of our current holdings and the inherent volatility in securities prices. Prior to 2018, the changes in unrealized gains and losses pertaining to such investments were recorded in other comprehensive income. The new accounting treatment has no effect on our consolidated shareholders equity. After-tax earnings of our business operations in 2018 were favorably affected by lower U.S. income tax expense, primarily attributable to a reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effect of the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate in 2018 on the comparative after-tax earnings of our various business operations varied, reflecting the differences in the mix of earnings subject to income tax, income tax credits and the effects of state and local income taxes. Net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) on December 22, 2017. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a one-time non-cash reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities from the reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a net benefit of approximately $900 million primarily attributable to our earnings from Kraft Heinz, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense of approximately $1.4 billion on the deemed repatriation of certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to their significance, we presented these one-time effects as a distinct item in the preceding table. Accordingly, the after-tax figures presented for 2017 in the discussion of our various operating businesses and other activities exclude the one-time effects of the TCJA. After-tax earnings from insurance underwriting were approximately $1.6 billion in 2018 compared to after-tax losses of approximately $2.2 billion in 2017. Results in 2018 included reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years property/casualty loss events, gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes on certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of U.S subsidiaries of $207 million and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $1.6 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax). After-tax losses from insurance underwriting in 2017 included estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $3.0 billion ($1.95 billion after-tax) from significant catastrophe events. Underwriting results in 2017 also included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate losses of $295 million. Our railroad business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume, higher average revenue per car/unit and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2017 were $4.0 billion, an increase of 10.9% compared to 2016, reflecting increased unit volume. Our utilities and energy businesses produced higher after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a lower overall effective income tax rate and the effects of losses incurred in 2017 in connection with the prepayment of certain long-term debt, partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings in certain of the regulated utilities. After-tax earnings of our utility and energy businesses in 2017 declined $197 million compared to 2016, reflecting the debt prepayment losses in 2017. K-32 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings in 2018 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 29% over 2017, due to lower effective income tax rates and a 13% increase in pre-tax earnings. After-tax earnings in 2017 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 7.0% compared to 2016, reflecting comparatively higher earnings from several of our larger operations and the impact of businesses acquired in 2016 and 2017. After-tax losses from investments and derivative contracts were $17.7 billion in 2018, which included after-tax losses of approximately $18 billion from changes in market values of our investments in equity securities held at December 31, 2018. Prior to 2018, after-tax investment gains or losses on equity securities arose from the sale of securities during the period based on the cost of the disposed security or through the recording of other-than-temporary impairment losses. In 2017, we recorded after-tax unrealized gains on our investments in equity securities of approximately $19 billion in other comprehensive income. After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $1.4 billion in 2017 and $6.5 billion in 2016. Investment gains in 2016 included approximately $2.7 billion from the redemptions of our Wrigley and Kraft Heinz preferred stock investments, and sales of Dow Chemical common stock we received in the conversion of the Dow Chemical preferred stock investment. Investment gains in 2016 also included a non-cash after-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion related to the exchange of Procter & Gamble (P&G) common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains of $289 million in 2018, losses of $655 million in 2017 and gains of $159 million in 2016 related to parent company Euro-denominated debt. In addition, other earnings in 2018 included losses from equity method investments due to Kraft Heinz, partly offset by earnings from other equity method investments. Other earnings in 2018 also reflected increased interest income from short-term investments. InsuranceUnderwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshires corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. Accordingly, we believe that such gains and losses are not necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million (pre-tax) from a current year event as significant. We incurred estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $1.6 billion in 2018 and $3.0 billion in 2017 from significant catastrophe events. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $110 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. K-33 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). Underwriting gain (loss): GEICO Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Net underwriting gain (loss) Effective income tax rate GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICOs underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Losses and loss adjustment expenses Underwriting expenses Total losses and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Premiums written were $34.1 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.7% compared to 2017. The increase reflected voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 3.3% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 6.4%. The increase in premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The rate increases were in response to accelerating claim costs in recent years. Although policies-in-force increased 540,000 during 2018, the rate of increase slowed, as voluntary auto new business sales decreased 4.7% compared to 2017. Pre-tax underwriting gains in 2018 were $2,449 million compared to losses of $310 million in 2017. Underwriting results in 2018 reflected the effects of lower losses from significant catastrophe events and from prior years loss events, as well as increased average premiums per policy. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were $26.3 billion in 2018, an increase of $781 million (3.1%) compared to 2017. GEICOs ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the loss ratio) for 2018 was 78.8%, a decline of 7.8 percentage points compared to 2017. Losses from significant catastrophe events were $105 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California) and approximately $450 million in 2017 (Hurricanes Harvey and Irma). Losses and loss adjustment expenses regularly include gains or losses for the decreases or increases in the ultimate claim loss estimates during the period for prior years loss events. These gains or losses produce corresponding increases or decreases to pre-tax underwriting gains. GEICOs losses and loss adjustment expenses included gains of $222 million in 2018 and losses of $517 million in 2017 with respect to prior years loss events. In addition, claims frequencies in 2018 for property damage, collision, and bodily and personal injury protection coverages declined (two to four percent range) compared to 2017. Average claims severities in 2018 increased for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range) versus 2017. K-34 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Underwriting expenses were approximately $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of $382 million (9.0%) over 2017. GEICOs expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2018 was 13.9%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2017. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Premiums written were $30.5 billion in 2017, an increase of 16.1% over 2016, and premiums earned were $29.4 billion, an increase of approximately $4.0 billion (15.5%). During 2017, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew approximately 8.6% and premiums per auto policy increased 6.9%. The increase in average premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2017 increased 10.5% compared to 2016. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,276,000 during 2017. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2017 were $310 million compared to pre-tax gains of $462 million in 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 increased approximately $4.5 billion (21.2%) compared to 2016. Our loss ratio in 2017 increased 4.0 percentage points compared to 2016. The increase in losses incurred was attributable to increased average claims severities, losses from significant catastrophe events in 2017 ($450 million) and losses with respect to prior years loss events ($517 million). Average claims severities were higher in 2017 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range). Claims frequencies in 2017 were relatively unchanged compared to 2016 for bodily injury coverage, decreased about one percent for property damage and collision coverages and decreased about two to three percent for personal injury protection coverage. Underwriting expenses increased $277 million (7.0%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Our expense ratio in 2017 declined 1.1 percentage points compared to 2016. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (NICO), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (BHLN) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, General Re). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. With the exception of our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses, we strive to generate pre-tax underwriting profits. Time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRGs premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Property/casualty Retroactive reinsurance Life/health Periodic payment annuity K-35 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Losses and loss adjustment expenses Underwriting expenses Total losses and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Property/casualty premiums earned in 2018 were $8.9 billion, an increase of 18.2% compared to 2017, while premiums earned in 2017 increased 4.6% compared to 2016. These increases were primarily attributable to higher direct and broker markets business, derived primarily from new business and increased participations for renewal business in both property and casualty lines. Premiums earned included approximately $1.8 billion in both 2018 and 2017 and $1.7 billion in 2016 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract entered into by NICO with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2018 decreased $288 million (4.0%) compared to 2017, and the loss ratio declined 18 percentage points to 77.6%. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events in 2018 were approximately $1.3 billion, which derived from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and the wildfires in California, including $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Losses from significant catastrophe events in 2017 were approximately $2.4 billion, which derived from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in 2016. In addition, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net gains of $469 million in 2018, $295 million in 2017 and $874 million in 2016 from reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years events. The net gain in 2018 was primarily due to lower than expected property losses. The net gain from prior years loss events in 2017 reflected losses from higher than expected property claims and increases in certain United Kingdom (U.K.) claim liabilities attributable to the U.K. Ministry of Justices decision to reduce the fixed discount rate required in lump sum settlement calculations of personal injury claims from 2.5% to negative 0.75%. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2018 were $517 million, which derived primarily from one contract. Premiums earned in 2017 included $10.2 billion from an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (the AIG Agreement). At the inception of our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we record the estimated ultimate claim liabilities, and we also record the excess of such claim liabilities over the premiums received as a deferred charge asset. Thus, as of the inception dates of these contracts, there is no net underwriting gain or loss. Deferred charge assets are subsequently amortized over the expected claim settlement period as losses and loss adjustment expenses. Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were $778 million in 2018, $1,330 million in 2017 and $60 million in 2016. Certain retroactive reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies. Pre-tax underwriting results included gains of $169 million in 2018, losses of $264 million in 2017 and gains of $392 million in 2016 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to currency exchange rate changes. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $947 million in 2018, $1,066 million in 2017 and $452 million in 2016, which derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments. Pre-tax underwriting losses related to the AIG Agreement were $611 million in 2018 and $527 million in 2017. In 2018, we decreased estimated ultimate liabilities $341 million for prior years retroactive reinsurance contracts, which after adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, produced pre-tax underwriting gains of approximately $185 million. Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years contracts had a relatively insignificant effect on pre-tax underwriting results in 2017 and 2016. K-36 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $42.9 billion at December 31, 2017. Deferred charge assets related to such contracts were approximately $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and $15.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Deferred charge assets will be charged to pre-tax earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Life and health insurance benefits Underwriting expenses Total benefits and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Life/health premiums earned were $5.3 billion, an increase of $535 million (11.1%) over 2017, which increased $221 million (4.8%) compared to 2016. The increases in each year were primarily attributable to growth in the North America, Asia and Australia life insurance markets. In each of the last three years, premiums earned of approximately $1.0 billion derived from a BHLN reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer covering predominantly life risks in North America. Our life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $216 million in 2018, losses of $52 million in 2017 and gains of $305 million in 2016. The underwriting gains in 2018 reflected lower losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by lower gains from the run-off of variable annuity guarantee contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded pre-tax losses of $450 million from discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions associated with long-term care liabilities. Pre-tax gains from variable annuity guarantee reinsurance were $34 million in 2018, $256 million in 2017 and $231 million in 2016. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which result from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2018 were $1,156 million, an increase of $258 million (28.7%) compared to 2017, which declined $184 million (17.0%) from 2016, reflecting a corresponding increase and decrease in new business volumes. Periodic payment business is price sensitive, and the volume we write can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts produced pre-tax losses of $340 million in 2018, $671 million in 2017 and $128 million in 2016. Certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies and pre-tax underwriting results included gains of $93 million in 2018, losses of $190 million in 2017 and gains of $313 million in 2016 from the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. Before foreign currency gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $433 million in 2018, $481 million in 2017 and $441 million in 2016. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities approximated $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and $11.2 billion at December 31, 2017, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.1%. K-37 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BH Specialty), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (GUARD), and National Indemnity Company (NICO Primary). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Losses and loss adjustment expenses Underwriting expenses Total losses and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain Premiums written and earned in 2018 increased 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to 2017. The increases in premiums written and earned were primarily attributable to written premium growth at BH Specialty (32.5%), GUARD (19.4%), NICO Primary (14.0%) and BHHC (7.6%). Premiums written and earned in 2017 increased 12.0% and 14.2%, respectively, compared to 2016 reflecting written premium increases from all of the significant BH Primary insurers, led by GUARD (26%), BH Specialty (23%) and BHHC (9%). BH Primarys loss ratios were 64.9% in 2018, 63.1% in 2017, and 61.8% in 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included losses from significant catastrophe events of $190 million in 2018 from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California and $225 million in 2017 from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net gains from the reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years loss events of $715 million in 2018, $766 million in 2017 and $503 million in 2016. The liability reductions in each year primarily related to healthcare malpractice and workers compensation business. BH Primary writes significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claim-tails, which could give rise to significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. InsuranceInvestment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Interest and other investment income Dividend income Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Net investment income Effective income tax rate K-38 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) InsuranceInvestment Income (Continued) Pre-tax interest and other investment income increased $588 million (46.6%) compared to 2017. The increase reflected the effect of higher short-term interest rates in 2018 and higher other investment income, partly offset by lower interest from lower average investments in fixed maturity securities. Our invested assets continue to include significant levels of short-term investments. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such investments. Dividend income increased $60 million (1.7%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting the impact of increased investments in marketable equity securities and higher dividend rates, partially offset by Restaurant Brands Internationals redemption of our $3 billion investment in 9% preferred stock in December 2017. Pre-tax investment income increased $373 million (8.3%) in 2017 compared to 2016, attributable to higher interest rates on short-term investments and increased other investment income. Dividend income in 2017 was relatively unchanged compared to 2016 reflecting increased dividend rates and increased overall investment levels, offset by the impact of the conversion of our $3 billion investment in Dow Chemical Company (Dow) 8.5% preferred stock into Dow common stock at the end of 2016. Prior to its conversion, we received dividends of $255 million per annum. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $123 billion at December 31, 2018, $114 billion at December 31, 2017, and $91 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in float in 2018 reflected the effects of the acquisition of MLMIC and overall growth of our insurance operations. The significant increase in float in 2017 reflected increases in loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities (net of deferred charges) assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2017 and estimated liabilities related to catastrophe events, and overall growth of our insurance operations. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for the period was negative. Pre-tax underwriting losses were approximately $3.2 billion in 2017 and our average cost of float was approximately 3.0%. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 follows (in millions). Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills Equity securities Fixed maturity securities Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions). U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds, investment grade Corporate bonds, non-investment grade Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government obligations are rated AA+ or Aaa by the major rating agencies. Approximately 87% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities rated below BBB- or Baa3. Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. K-39 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSFs earnings follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits Fuel Purchased services Depreciation and amortization Equipment rents, materials and other Total operating expenses Interest expense Pre-tax earnings Income taxes Net earnings Effective income tax rate 2018 versus 2017 BNSFs revenues were $23.9 billion in 2018, representing an increase of $2.5 billion (11.5%) versus 2017. BNSFs revenues in 2018 reflected a 6.2% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.1% increase in volume. Combined volume was 10.7 million cars/units compared to 10.3 million in 2017. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit, higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, and business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2017. Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.1% compared to 2017, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit and volume increases of 2.9%. The volume increases were due to higher domestic intermodal volumes, primarily attributable to general economic growth and tight truck capacity leading to conversion from highway to rail, as well as growth in imports and containerized agricultural product exports, partially offset by a sizable contract loss. Revenues from industrial products were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 16.2% from 2017. The increase was attributable to volume increases of 9.8% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2018 were higher primarily due to strength in the industrial and energy sectors, which drove higher demand for petroleum products, building products, construction products, and plastics. Revenues from agricultural products increased 8.8% in 2018 to $4.7 billion compared to 2017. The increase was due to higher volumes of 9.0%, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased due to strong export and domestic corn shipments, as well as higher fertilizer and other grain products volumes, partially offset by a reduction in soybean and wheat exports. Revenues from coal in 2018 increased 4.3% to $4.0 billion compared to 2017, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 0.8%. The volume decreases in 2018 were due mainly to utility plant retirements combined with competition from natural gas and renewables, mostly offset by market share gains and improved export volumes. Total operating expenses were $16.0 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.9 billion (13.6%) compared to 2017. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.2 percentage points to 66.9% in 2018 versus 2017. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $371 million (7.4%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to wage inflation and increased headcount and associated training costs. Fuel expenses increased $828 million (32.9%) compared to 2017 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. K-40 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) (Continued) Purchased services expense increased $356 million (14.2%) compared to 2017. The increase was due to higher purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, as well as increased intermodal ramping, drayage, and other volume-related costs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense increased $388 million (23.7%) compared to 2017. The increase resulted from higher locomotive material, personal injury expenses, derailment-related costs, and property taxes, as well as a benefit of the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee in 2017. BNSFs effective income tax rate was 24.0% for 2018 as compared to 37.4% for 2017 which excludes the effects of the TCJA. The reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018, drove most of the effective income tax rate decrease. 2017 versus 2016 BNSFs revenues were $21.4 billion in 2017, representing an increase of $1.6 billion (7.9%) versus 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased 11.2% in 2017 compared to 2016. During 2017, BNSFs revenues reflected a 2.4% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 5.3% increase in volume. Combined volume was 10.3 million cars/units in 2017 compared to 9.8 million in 2016. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue, increased rates per car/unit and business mix changes. Revenues from consumer products were $7.1 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 8.8% compared to 2016, reflecting volume increases of 6.3% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increases were primarily attributable to improving economic conditions, normalizing of retail inventories, new services and higher market share, which benefited domestic intermodal, international intermodal and automotive volumes. Revenues from industrial products were $5.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 7.7% from 2016, attributable to a volume increase of 5.0% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2017 were higher for sand and other commodities that support drilling. In addition, broad strengthening in the industrial sector drove greater demand for steel and taconite. These volume increases were partially offset by lower petroleum products volume due to pipeline displacement of U.S. crude rail traffic. Revenues from agricultural products increased 1.8% to $4.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes were relatively flat, primarily due to higher shipments of domestic grain, ethanol and other grain products, offset by lower grain exports. Revenues from coal increased 13.7% to $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit as well as 6.3% higher volumes. The volume increases in 2017 were due to the effects of higher natural gas prices, which led to increased utility coal usage. This was partially offset by the effects of unit retirements at coal generating facilities, increased renewable generation and coal inventory adjustments at customer facilities. Total operating expenses were $14.0 billion in 2017, an increase of $899 million (6.8%) compared to 2016. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 0.6 percentage points to 65.7% in 2017 versus 2016. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $214 million (4.4%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher health and welfare costs and volume-related increases, partially offset by lower headcount. Fuel expenses increased $584 million (30.2%) compared to 2016 primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $224 million (10.5%) compared to 2016 due to a larger base of depreciable assets in service. Equipment rents, materials and other expense declined $219 million (11.8%) compared to 2016. These declines resulted from the impact of the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee, as well as lower personal injury and casualty costs. Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE), which operates a global energy business. BHEs domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (AltaLink, L.P.) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. K-41 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these regulated operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of our domestic regulated utilities from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHEs regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base, which produced lower revenue and pre-tax earnings in 2018. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (dollars in millions). PacifiCorp MidAmerican Energy Company NV Energy Northern Powergrid Natural gas pipelines Other energy businesses Real estate brokerage Corporate interest Pre-tax earnings Income tax expense (benefit) Net earnings Noncontrolling interests Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Effective income tax rate PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Revenues in 2018 decreased 4% compared to 2017. Retail revenues in 2018 decreased $197 million compared to 2017. The decline reflected the effects of lower average rates ($180 million, including the impact of the TCJA of $152 million), and a reduction in volumes (0.2%), largely attributable to the impacts of weather. Pre-tax earnings decreased $386 million (34%) in 2018 as compared to 2017. Utility margin (operating revenues less cost of fuel and energy) in 2018 was $3,269 million, a decrease of $198 million (6%) versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the declines in revenues, which included the effects of the TCJA. In addition, pre-tax earnings were negatively impacted $174 million (offset in income tax expense) due to a state regulatory order that accelerated depreciation expense on certain thermal generation facilities. PacifiCorps after-tax earnings in 2018 were $739 million, a decrease of $24 million (3%) from 2017. Revenues increased 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. Wholesale and other revenues increased, reflecting higher volumes and average rates, and retail revenues decreased slightly, attributable to lower average rates, partly offset by higher volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $26 million (2%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in earnings reflected higher utility margin, lower operations and maintenance expenses, and increased depreciation and amortization attributable to additional plant in-service. PacifiCorps after-tax earnings in 2017 were $763 million, a decrease of $1 million from 2016. K-42 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues in 2018 increased $211 million (7%) compared to 2017. Electric operating revenues increased $175 million (8%) and natural gas revenues increased $35 million (5%) in 2018 versus 2017. The increase in electric revenues was primarily attributable to higher retail revenues of $102 million, reflecting higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of sales, operating expenses and income tax expense) and volumes, partially offset by lower average rates, predominantly from the impact of the TCJA, and higher wholesale and other revenues of $73 million from higher volumes and average prices. The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by a lower average per-unit price and the effects of the TCJA. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased $35 million (9%) compared to 2017. Electric utility margin in 2018 was $1,796 million, an increase of $122 million (7%) over 2017, which was primarily due to the net increase in retail revenues. However, the increase in electric utility margin was mostly offset by increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating expenses. The increase in depreciation expense included $65 million from additional wind generation and other plant placed in-service and $44 million from Iowa revenue sharing. MECs after-tax earnings in 2018 and 2017 were $669 million and $584 million, respectively, increases of $85 million (15%) and $52 million (10%), respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. MECs after-tax earnings were significantly greater than pre-tax earnings, primarily due to production income tax credits received relating to wind-powered generating facilities. Revenues increased $238 million (9%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher electric operating revenues ($123 million) and increased natural gas operating revenues ($82 million). Retail electric revenues increased $84 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher recoveries through bill riders and from non-weather usage and growth and rate factors, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of milder temperatures in 2017. Wholesale electric and other revenues increased $39 million in 2017 versus 2016, attributable to comparative increases in volumes, average rates and transmission fees. The natural gas operating revenues increase was primarily due to higher average per-unit costs of gas sold, which was offset by an increase in cost of sales. Pre-tax earnings declined $20 million (5%) in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating expenses and interest expense and debt extinguishment costs, partially offset by comparative increases in electric utility margins of $76 million. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues in 2018 increased 1% compared to 2017. Electric operating revenues increased $17 million in 2018, reflecting increased pass-through cost adjustments and higher volumes largely attributable to the impacts of weather and retail customer growth, partly offset by reductions from the impact of the TCJA and lower retail rates resulting from a 2017 regulatory rate review. Natural gas operating revenue increased $5 million in 2018, primarily due to a higher average per-unit price, partially offset by lower customer usage. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased $150 million (26%) compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower electric utility margin and increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating costs. Electric utility margin in 2018 was $1,696 million, representing a $52 million (3%) decrease versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the TCJA, partially offset by the higher sales volumes. NV Energys after-tax earnings in 2018 were $317 million, a decline of 13% from 2017. Revenues increased $123 million (4%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in retail electric operating revenues, which included a combination of increased rates from pass-through cost adjustments and higher volumes, partly offset by lower revenues from energy efficiency programs (offset by lower operating expenses). NV Energy also experienced retail electric revenue declines from the transition of certain commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase power from alternative sources and thus becoming distribution service only customers. Natural gas operating revenue declined $11 million in 2017, primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by higher customer usage. Pre-tax earnings increased $8 million (1%) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower interest expenses. NV Energys after-tax earnings in 2017 were $365 million, an increase of 2% from 2016. K-43 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) Northern Powergrid Revenues increased $71 million (7%) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the favorable foreign currency translation effects of a weaker average U.S. Dollar in 2018 and increased smart meter and distribution revenues. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased $7 million (2%) compared to 2017, primarily due to higher depreciation and other operating expenses, including higher pension settlement losses, partly offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects and the increases in revenues. Revenues declined $47 million (5%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Foreign currency translation effects of a comparatively stronger average U.S. Dollar in 2017 resulted in a $48 million comparative decline in revenues. In addition, we experienced comparative declines in distribution revenues, which were substantially offset by higher smart metering revenue. Pre-tax earnings declined $56 million (15%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The decline was primarily due to foreign currency translation effects, as well as from increased pension expenses and lower distribution revenues, partially offset by lower asset impairment charges and lower distribution costs. Natural gas pipelines Revenues increased $217 million (22%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher transportation revenues of $113 million from higher volumes and rates due to unique market opportunities and colder average temperatures and increased sales volumes ($99 million) related to system balancing activities (substantially offset in cost of sales). Pre-tax earnings increased $61 million (14%) in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increases in transportation revenues and lower depreciation expense, partly offset by comparative increases in operations and maintenance expenses. Revenues increased $23 million (2%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Northern Natural Gas produced higher transportation revenues and higher gas sales, primarily from system balancing activities, which were partly offset by lower transportation revenues at Kern River. Pre-tax earnings increased $33 million (8%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in transportation revenues and a reduction in expenses and regulatory liabilities related to the impact of an alternative rate structure approved by Kern Rivers regulators in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Other energy businesses Revenues in 2018 increased $43 million (2%) compared to 2017, reflecting a comparative increase from renewable energy. Pre-tax earnings in 2018 were unchanged from 2017 as the increased revenues from renewable energy were offset by increased depreciation expense and higher other operating expenses. Revenues increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016. AltaLink L.P.s operating revenues increased $197 million (39%) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to effects of a decision in 2016 by its regulator, which changed the timing of when construction-in-progress expenditures included in the rate base are billable to customers and earned in revenues. The decision resulted in a one-time net reduction in revenue in 2016, with offsetting reductions in expenses. In 2017, we also experienced a comparative revenue increase of 13% from renewable energy and a comparative decline of 12% from the unregulated retail services business. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 increased 5% compared to 2016, as increased earnings from renewable energy and AltaLink L.P. were partly offset by lower earnings from the unregulated retail services business and other energy ventures. Real estate brokerage Revenues in 2018 increased 22% as compared to 2017, primarily due to recent business acquisitions. Pre-tax earnings decreased $16 million in 2018 compared to 2017, as higher operating costs and interest expense more than offset the revenue increase. Revenues increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to business acquisitions and an increase in average home sales prices. Pre-tax earnings decreased 2% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Earnings in 2017 included increased earnings from franchise businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from brokerage businesses, primarily due to higher operating expenses. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by the BHE holding company and borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries in connection with certain of BHEs business acquisitions. The borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries were repaid in the third quarter of 2017. Corporate interest in 2017 also included pre-tax charges of $410 million from a tender offer completed in December 2017 to redeem certain long-term debt of BHE. Otherwise, corporate interest declined 6% and 7%, respectively, in 2018 and 2017 as compared to the corresponding prior years, primarily due to lower average borrowings. K-44 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) Corporate interest and income taxes (Continued) BHEs consolidated effective income tax rates were (18.3)% in 2018, 5.9% in 2017 and 12.9% in 2016. BHEs effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service by our domestic regulated utilities and other energy businesses. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to the reduction in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate, the impacts of rate making, adjustments to the amounts recorded for the repatriation tax on foreign earnings, higher production tax credits and lower U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate in 2017 decreased versus 2016 primarily due to an increase in production tax credits. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Manufacturing Service and retailing Pre-tax earnings Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Effective income tax rate Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $932 million in 2018, $937 million in 2017 and $814 million in 2016. These expenses are included in Other in the summary of earnings on page K-32 and in the Other earnings section on page K-53. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. Industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (IMC)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (CTB)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (LSPI)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (UTLX), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and the Duracell Company (Duracell), a manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Industrial products Building products Consumer products K-45 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products 2018 versus 2017 Revenues from industrial products businesses were approximately $30.7 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion (7.4%) compared to 2017. PCCs revenues in 2018 were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to 2017. The increase reflected increased demand in aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower demand for industrial gas turbine products. PCC is in the process of repurposing certain manufacturing assets previously used to support industrial gas turbine business to accommodate aerospace products. In addition, PCC experienced lower sales of certain pipe products in 2018, primarily attributable to the U.S tariffs. Lubrizols revenues in 2018 were $6.8 billion, an increase of 5.9% compared to 2017 due to higher average sales prices, favorable changes in product mix and foreign currency translation effects, and a 2% increase in aggregate unit volumes. Lubrizol experienced significant increases in average material unit costs during 2018 and 2017, necessitating increases in sales prices. Lubrizols consolidated volume included increases in the Advanced Materials (5%) and the Additives (1%) product lines. Marmons revenues in 2018 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 5.5% as compared to 2017. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to volume increases in the Transportation Products sector, higher average metals prices in the Plumbing & Refrigeration, Electrical Products, and Metal Services sectors, and business acquisitions in the Transportation Products, Crane Services, and Engineered Wire & Cable sectors. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases in the Beverage Technologies and Rail Products and Services sectors. Rail Products and Services sector revenues decreased due to lower railcar lease revenues, partly offset by increased railcar equipment sales and repair services. Throughout 2018, the railcar leasing business experienced the negative effects of lower lease renewal rates for railcars versus the rates on expiring leases. IMCs revenues increased 16.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a combination of factors, including higher unit sales, the effects of business acquisitions during 2017 and 2018, and foreign currency translation effects from a weaker average U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2018. CTBs revenues increased 4.0% in 2018 versus 2017, due to favorable foreign currency translation effects and modest sales growth in protein production and processing systems. Pre-tax earnings of the industrial products group were approximately $5.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $757 million (14.9%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% in 2018 and 17.7% in 2017. The comparative earnings increase was partially attributable to certain one-time charges at PCC and Lubrizol in 2017. PCCs pre-tax earnings increased 16.0% in 2018 compared to 2017. PCCs earnings in 2017 included certain one-time inventory and impairment charges of $272 million. Results in 2018 were negatively affected by costs associated with the temporary unplanned shut-down of certain metals facilities, metal press outages and lower earnings from the industrial gas turbine business. The facilities that were shut-down gradually resumed production and were approximately 80% operational at the end of 2018. These facilities are expected to resume normal production in early 2019. In addition, the aforementioned new aircraft programs involve relatively complex manufacturing processes and manufacturing costs to-date have been relatively high, negatively affecting earnings. However, we expect costs will decline as processes improve and efficiencies develop. Lubrizols pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased 43.5% compared to earnings in 2017, which included pre-tax losses of approximately $190 million related to Lubrizols disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business and related intangible asset impairments and restructuring charges. Before such charges, Lubrizols earnings increased 17%, reflecting the previously mentioned increases in sales volumes and selling prices, as well as lower other restructuring charges, lower net interest expense, and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Marmons pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased 5.6% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings from the Rail Products and Services sector ($126 million) and the Foodservice Technologies and Retail Solutions sectors ($33 million), partially offset by increased earnings from the Transportation Products sector and a non-recurring gain of $42 million in 2018 from the sale of certain assets of the Beverage Technologies sector. The Rail Products and Services earnings decline was attributable to lower railcar leasing revenues and higher lease fleet repair costs. K-46 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) IMCs pre-tax earnings increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a combination of higher sales, increased manufacturing efficiencies, the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs. CTBs pre-tax earnings in 2018 were lower, primarily due to lower gross sales margins attributable to raw material cost increases and higher other operating expenses. 2017 versus 2016 Industrial products revenues were approximately $28.6 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.6 billion (6.1%) versus 2016, reflecting increased revenues at several of our businesses. PCCs revenues increased $754 million (8.6%) in 2017 compared to the eleven-month post-acquisition period in 2016. On a comparable full year-to-date basis, PCCs revenues increased approximately 2.3% compared to 2016. In 2017, PCC generated revenue increases from structural castings, airfoils and forged products and from business acquisitions, partly offset by lower revenues from airframe products and industrial gas turbine products used in power markets. Revenue increases associated with PCCs transition into products for new aerospace programs were partly offset by revenue decreases from the winding down of prior programs. Lubrizols revenues increased $165 million (2.6%) compared to 2016, primarily due to higher unit volumes, partly offset by effects of the disposition of an underperforming business. Marmons revenues increased $305 million (4.1%) in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to business acquisitions and higher average metal prices, partly offset by lower overall volumes, changes in mix and lower leasing revenues from the Rail Products and Services sector. Railcar leasing revenues declined due to fewer railcars on lease at lower rates. During 2017, railcars available for lease exceeded demand, which contributed to the lower lease rates. IMCs revenues increased 13.3%, primarily due to increased customer demand and from business acquisitions. The global demand for cutting tools was generally higher in 2017. CTBs revenues increased 5.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase reflected the impact of a bolt-on business acquisition, partly offset by weak demand in the U.S. egg and poultry production markets and selling price pressures for grain storage systems. Industrial products pre-tax earnings were approximately $5.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $76 million (1.5%) compared to 2016. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 17.7% in 2017 and 18.5% in 2016. PCCs pre-tax earnings declined 12.5% in 2017 compared to the post-acquisition period in 2016, primarily due to certain one-time inventory and impairment charges. Lubrizols pre-tax earnings increased 17.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to the disposition in 2016 of an underperforming bolt-on business and ongoing cost containment efforts, partly offset by lower gross sales margins, which were primarily attributable to higher average raw material prices. In 2017, average raw material prices at Lubrizol, including base oil feedstock and petrochemicals, increased about 9% versus 2016. Marmons earnings in 2017 declined 3.5% compared to 2016, primarily due to lower earnings of the Rail Products and Services sector, partially offset by the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing cost control efforts. Building products 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the building products group in 2018 were approximately $18.7 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the building products group were approximately $2.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.8% versus 2017. Overall, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2018 and 12.7% in 2017. The pre-tax earnings increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Clayton Homes and Shaw, partly offset by lower earnings from Johns Manville. Clayton Homes revenues were $6,046 million in 2018, an increase of $1,036 million (20.7%) over 2017. The increase was driven by an increase in revenues from home sales of $971 million (28.2%), primarily due to a 105% increase in unit sales of site built homes attributable to businesses acquired over the last two years. Unit sales of manufactured homes in 2018 also increased 4.9% compared to 2017. Average unit prices of site built homes are considerably higher than traditional manufactured homes. In addition, interest income from lending activities increased 4% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased average outstanding loan balances. K-47 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings were $911 million in 2018, an increase of $145 million (19.0%) compared to 2017. The increase in earnings in 2018 was primarily attributable to a significant increase in earnings from home building (manufactured housing and site built homes) activities, which reflected the impact of increased home sales and margins, as well as increased earnings from lending activities. A significant part of Clayton Homes earnings derives from manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending activities in 2018 declined 2% compared to 2017, reflecting increased interest expense, attributable to higher average debt balances and interest rates and higher operating costs, which more than offset the increase in interest income. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $14.7 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. Revenues of our other building products businesses increased 5.8% in 2018 to approximately $12.6 billion compared to 2017. In 2018, Shaws sales increased 7.9% and Johns Manvilles sales increased 7.2% as compared to 2017. The increases reflected higher average selling prices, product mix changes and overall unit volume increases. Raw material and production costs of our building products businesses were generally higher in 2018. In particular, costs for steel, titanium dioxide and petrochemicals were substantially higher in 2018 than in 2017, as were product delivery costs, due in part to the shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. These cost increases precipitated sales price increases, although such increases have lagged the increases in raw materials costs. As a result, the increase in pre-tax earnings in 2018 of our other building products businesses ($43 million or 3.1%) lagged the 5.8% increase in revenues. 2017 versus 2016 Building products revenues were approximately $16.9 billion in 2017, an increase of approximately $1.9 billion (13.0%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to bolt-on business acquisitions by Clayton, Shaw and MiTek. The remainder of the increase reflected sales volume increases at MiTek, Benjamin Moore and Johns Manville, partly offset by changes in prices and product mix. Clayton Homes revenues were approximately $5.0 billion in 2017, an increase of $780 million (18%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to sales from newly-acquired site built home businesses, an increase in overall unit sales (9%) and higher average prices. Interest income from lending activities and other and financial services revenues increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Building products pre-tax earnings were $2.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $225 million (11.7%) compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.7% in 2017 and 12.8% in 2016. Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings increased $21 million (2.8%) in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 from manufacturing, retailing and site built activities increased, while earnings from finance activities declined slightly. Clayton Homes earnings in 2017 also included a gain from a legal settlement, offset by increased employee healthcare, technology, marketing and other expenses. The comparative earnings increase reflected the effects of asset impairment, pension settlement and environmental claim charges of $107 million recorded in 2016 by Shaw and Benjamin Moore. The comparative earnings increase also was a result of bolt-on acquisitions, partly offset by comparative declines in average gross sales margin rates due to higher raw material and other production costs. Consumer products 2018 versus 2017 Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $394 million (3.2%) compared to 2017, which was primarily due to revenue increases of Forest River and of our apparel and footwear businesses. Forest Rivers revenues increased 2.6% in 2018, reflecting relatively unchanged unit sales versus 2017. However, over the second half of the year, comparative sales declined 5%, reflecting a 7% decline in units sold. Management attributes the slowing of sales, in part, to the effects of U.S. tariffs on steel products. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 4.6% to approximately $4.3 billion, primarily due to increased sales volume at Brooks Sports and Garan. Pre-tax earnings were $1,208 million in 2018, an increase of $96 million (8.6%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 9.6% in 2018 and 9.2% in 2017. The increase in earnings reflected increases from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Larson Juhl. K-48 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) Forest Rivers pre-tax earnings in 2018 declined 9.0% compared to 2017. Operating results were adversely affected over the second half of 2018, and in the fourth quarter in particular, by higher material costs, which, together with the effects of lower sales volumes, contributed to a 28% reduction in fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. Pre-tax earnings of the apparel and footwear businesses increased 6.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenues and sales mix changes. Duracells pre-tax earnings increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the favorable effects of ongoing operational improvement efforts and a comparative decline in restructuring charges. Since its acquisition in 2016, Duracell has undertaken significant transition and restructuring initiatives intended to restore and maintain adequate profit levels over the long-term. 2017 versus 2016 Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.1 billion (10%) compared to 2016, driven by increases from Duracell and Forest River. Duracells revenues increased 25.3% in 2017 compared to the ten-month post-acquisition period in 2016. Forest Rivers revenues increased 13.7% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a 13.5% comparative increase in units sold. Apparel and footwear revenues were approximately $4.2 billion in 2017, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2016. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $288 million (35%) in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in earnings was primarily due to increased earnings from Duracell and Forest River. The improvement in Duracells operating results in 2017 reflects an overall reduction in transition costs and the positive effects of ongoing restructuring and business development efforts. Forest Rivers earnings increased 23% in 2017, primarily attributable to the increase in sales and lower manufacturing overhead rates. Earnings from apparel and footwear businesses increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from the footwear businesses. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Service Retailing McLane Company Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). K-49 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the service group were approximately $13.3 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion (9.7%) compared to 2017. TTIs revenues in 2018 increased approximately 33.7% compared to 2017, reflecting industry-wide increases in demand for electronic components in many geographic markets around the world, and the effects of recent business acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. While TTIs revenue increase in 2018 was significant, revenue growth began to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part attributable to the impact of U.S. trade tariffs. WPLG generated a revenue increase of 20.8% in 2018 over 2017, primarily due to increased political advertising revenue. Revenues of Charter Brokerage increased 53.3%, reflecting increased fees and product mix changes. Revenues of our leasing businesses increased 8.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased over-the road trailer units on lease (XTRA) and increased furniture rental income (CORT). Pre-tax earnings of the service group in 2018 were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of $317 million (20.9%) compared to 2017. The comparative earnings increase was primarily due to TTI, which accounted for almost 84% of the increase. The earnings increase of TTI was primarily due to the effects of the sales volume increases. In addition, XTRA, Charter Brokerage and NetJets each generated increased earnings in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in earnings of these businesses were partly offset by lower earnings at FlightSafety, primarily due to reduced margins from sales of flight simulators and impairment charges of $41 million related to certain fixed assets. 2017 versus 2016 Service business revenues were approximately $12.2 billion in 2017, an increase of $855 million (7.6%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to TTI and NetJets. TTIs revenues increased 16.4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher customer demand. NetJets revenues increased due to an increase in revenue flight hours and increased aircraft management services. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $1.5 billion in 2017, an increase of $120 million (8.6%) compared to 2016. The comparative increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased earnings of NetJets and TTI, partly offset by comparatively lower earnings from FlightSafety, and from our leasing, media and logistics businesses. Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles, and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), Sees Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (Louis), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 2018 versus 2017 Revenues of the retailing group were approximately $15.6 billion in 2018, an increase of $542 million (3.6%) compared to 2017. BHAs revenues, which represented approximately 63% of the aggregate retailing revenues in each of the past three years, increased 4.0% in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase derived primarily from increased pre-owned vehicle sales and service contract revenues. Revenues from new vehicle sales were relatively unchanged. Louis revenues increased 7.8% in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to the translation effects of a weaker average U.S. Dollar. Home furnishings revenues increased 4.7% in 2018 over 2017, reflecting increased sales in certain geographic markets and the effect of a new store. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group were $860 million in 2018, an increase of $75 million (9.6%) over 2017. The earnings increase included higher earnings from BHA and Louis, partly offset by lower earnings from the home furnishings retailers. The earnings increase of BHA was primarily from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. The earnings increase at Louis reflected the revenues increase and an increase in operating margin rate. Earnings of the home furnishings businesses declined 2.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, partly due to increased inventory liquidation, delivery and occupancy costs at Star Furniture. K-50 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) 2017 versus 2016 Retailing revenues were $15.1 billion in 2017, slightly lower than in 2016. BHAs aggregate revenues declined 1.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily due to a 3.7% decline in new and used cars sold, partly offset by higher service and finance revenues. Revenues of our other retailers increased 1.7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pre-tax earnings increased $126 million (19.1%) in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase reflected comparatively higher earnings from BHA, primarily due to increased earnings from service contract and finance activities and lower selling and administrative expenses, partly offset by lower auto sales volumes and margins. Pre-tax earnings of our home furnishings retailers increased 6.5% in 2017 compared to 2016. Pampered Chef also produced comparatively higher earnings in 2017, primarily attributable to revenue increases and expense management efforts. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (grocery) and to restaurants (foodservice). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (beverage). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised approximately 67% of McLanes consolidated sales in 2018 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. McLanes revenues were approximately $50.0 billion in 2018, slightly higher than 2017, reflecting a slight increase in grocery sales (1%) and a slight decrease in foodservice sales (1%). The decline in foodservice revenues was primarily due to a net loss of customers. Pre-tax earnings were $246 million in 2018, a decline of $53 million (17.7%), compared to 2017. McLanes grocery and foodservice businesses continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. While gross margin rates increased slightly over 2018, increases in fuel, depreciation and certain other operating expenses more than offset the increase, producing a decline in pre-tax earnings compared to 2017. We expect the current unfavorable operating conditions will continue in 2019. McLanes revenues were approximately $49.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 3.5% compared to 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 4.7% increase in grocery business sales. Pre-tax earnings in 2017 were $299 million, a decrease of $132 million (30.6%) compared to 2016. The earnings decline reflected a 57% decline in earnings from our grocery operations, partly offset by a $39 million increase in gains from asset sales. Throughout 2017, significant pricing pressures and an increasingly competitive business environment negatively affected McLanes operating results, particularly with respect to the grocery business. Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions). Investment gains (losses) Derivative gains (losses) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Net gains (losses) Effective income tax rate K-51 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses) (Continued) Investment gains (losses) As discussed in Note 1(w) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement (ASU 2016-01), which requires the recognition of unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market values of investments in equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses related to equity securities were generally recorded as the securities were sold, redeemed or exchanged based on the cost of the disposed securities. While ASU 2016-01 does not affect our consolidated shareholders equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains and losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. Pre-tax investment gains/losses reflected in earnings in 2018 included net unrealized losses of approximately $22.7 billion from investments in equity securities still held at December 31, 2018, reflecting the declines in securities prices in the fourth quarter. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, such unrealized gains and losses were included in other comprehensive income. Pre-tax net unrealized gains on equity securities recorded in other comprehensive income were approximately $29 billion in 2017 and $7 billion in 2016. Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.4 billion in 2017 and $7.6 billion in 2016. Investment gains in 2016 included $4.2 billion from the redemptions of our Wrigley and Kraft Heinz preferred stock investments and from the sales of Dow Chemical common stock that was received upon the conversion of our Dow Chemical preferred stock investment. We also realized pre-tax gains of $1.1 billion in connection with the tax-free exchange of our shares of P&G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Income tax expense allocated to investment gains in 2016 included a benefit from the reduction of certain deferred income tax liabilities in connection with the exchange of P&G common stock for Duracell. Our after-tax gain from this transaction was approximately $1.9 billion. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains (losses) Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities. These liabilities relate to contracts entered into before March 2008. Substantially all of these contracts will expire between April 2019 and February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $1,653 million and our recorded liabilities at fair value were approximately $2,452 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $12.2 billion will expire in 2019. Derivative contracts produced pre-tax losses in 2018 of $300 million, which were primarily due to lower index values. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $718 million in 2017 and $662 million in 2016, which reflected the effects of shorter remaining contract durations and overall higher index values. In July 2016, our last credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty and we paid the counterparty $195 million. This contract produced pre-tax earnings of $89 million in 2016. K-52 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) follows (in millions). Equity method earnings (losses) Acquisition accounting expenses Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects Euro note foreign exchange gains (losses) Corporate interest and dividend income Other Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders After-tax equity method earnings includes Berkshires share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot Flying J, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax equity method losses in 2018 included approximately $2.7 billion from intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our after-tax equity method earnings in 2017 excluded approximately $1.1 billion from the net effects of the TCJA on Kraft Heinzs net earnings. Corporate interest and dividend income in 2016 included pre-tax dividend income of $180 million from our Kraft Heinz preferred stock investment, which Kraft Heinz redeemed in June 2016. After-tax other earnings (losses) also include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshires past business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Berkshire issued Euro denominated debt in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and the aggregate par amount outstanding was 6.85 billion at December 31, 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced sizable non-cash unrealized gains and losses in each of the past three years from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2018 was approximately $349 billion, a decrease of $26.9 billion since September 30, 2018 and an increase of $407 million since December 31, 2017. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2018 were $4.0 billion, which included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $17.5 billion. After-tax losses on investments were approximately $27.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting the declines in market prices of the equity securities we owned at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately $109 billion, which included $85 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were approximately $193 billion. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 was approximately $16.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion since December 31, 2017, reflecting term debt maturities of $1.55 billion and a $366 million decrease attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes applicable to the 6.85 billion par amount of Euro denominated senior notes. Berkshire parent company debt of $750 million matures in 2019. Borrowings of Berkshires insurance and other subsidiaries declined $3.5 billion in 2018 to approximately $18.1 billion at December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to a net decrease in borrowings of Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC), a wholly-owned financing subsidiary. During 2018, BHFC repaid $4.6 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.35 billion of 4.2% senior notes due in 2048. BHFCs senior note borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In January 2019, BHFC repaid $950 million of maturing senior notes and issued $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049. An additional $3.0 billion of BHFC senior notes will mature in 2019. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFCs senior notes. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $10.5 billion for the year ending December 31, 2019. K-53 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Financial Condition (Continued) BNSFs outstanding debt approximated $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $727 million since December 31, 2017. In 2018, BNSF issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured debentures due in 2048 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. BNSF debentures of $750 million will mature in 2019. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $39.3 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $390 million since December 31, 2017. In 2018, BHE issued $3.2 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2049 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. BHE subsidiaries also issued debt in 2018, aggregating $2.3 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2049. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. Approximately $2.1 billion of BHE subsidiary term debt will mature in 2019. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshires common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshires intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshires Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshires consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Subsequent to the program amendment, in 2018, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.3 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations not currently reflected in the financial statements, will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations will be included in the consolidated balance sheet upon the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table. Notes payable and other borrowings, including interest Operating leases Purchase obligations (1) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) Other Total Primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. Includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts. Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. K-54 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2018 follows. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as gross unpaid losses or claim liabilities) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the claim-tail. Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2018 were approximately $110 billion, of which 84% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of these businesses follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2018, GEICOs gross unpaid losses were $19.5 billion. Claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable were $18.6 billion. GEICOs claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (BI), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2018, case development liabilities averaged approximately 30% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. For incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims, liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2017 decreased $222 million during 2018, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. We modified the assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2018 to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. With respect to liabilities for BI claims, our most significant claim category, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2018. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $275 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. K-55 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) BHRGs liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period. Outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks thereby creating multiple contractual parties between us and the primary insured, potentially compounding the claim reporting delays. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. When received, we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding companys books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. A summary of BHRGs property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Reported case liabilities IBNR liabilities Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Reinsurance recoverable Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the table above consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. K-56 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) (Continued) With respect to General Re, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. The critical processes involved in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include the establishment of case liability estimates, the determination of expected loss ratios and loss reporting patterns, which drive IBNR liability estimates, and the comparison of reported activity to the expected loss reporting patterns. General Res process for estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses starts with case loss estimates reported by ceding companies. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. As of December 31, 2018, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.0 billion, which were concentrated in legacy workers compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. In estimating IBNR liabilities, General Re considers expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. In this process, we classify all loss and premium data into groups or portfolios of policies based primarily on product type (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers compensation) and/or geographic jurisdiction, and in some cases contractual features or market segment. For each portfolio, we aggregate premiums and losses by accident year or coverage period and analyze the paid and incurred loss data over time. We estimate the expected development of reported claims, which, together with the expected loss ratios, are used to calculate IBNR liability estimates. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns. NICO generally establishes reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis determined from case loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimates. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgments on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. BHRGs estimated ultimate net losses for prior years loss events were reduced $469 million in 2018, which produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reported claims for prior years property loss events were less than anticipated and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $365 million. Property losses incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss events. In addition, we lowered estimated ultimate losses for prior years casualty events $104 million in 2018, reflecting reduced estimates for workers compensation and other casualty coverages, partially offset by an increase in estimates for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. General Res reported losses for prior years workers compensation claims were less than expected. After reevaluating expected remaining IBNR estimates, liabilities were reduced by $117 million. An increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1 billion in General Res workers compensation IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. We reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years events for other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, by $132 million in 2018, reflecting lower than expected reported losses. For General Res significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $800 million. While we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates, more likely outcomes are less than $800 million given the diversification in worldwide business. K-57 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Property and casualty losses (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) (Continued) Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims were increased approximately $145 million in 2018, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018. We may use industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment when internal loss data is of limited reliability in making estimates for such losses. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment, and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios, which is the average net claim payments in recent years in relation to net unpaid losses, as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. Our survival ratio was approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2018. Retroactive reinsurance Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. Our gross unpaid losses, deferred charge assets, and net liabilities at December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions). December 31, 2018 Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications. We currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $55 billion due to the applicable aggregate contract limits. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our $41.8 billion estimated liability at December 31, 2018. We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $13.1 billion at December 31, 2018. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years retroactive reinsurance contracts by $341 million in 2018, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $185 million. In 2018, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.4 billion with respect to these contracts. In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2018, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2019 will approximate $1.2 billion. K-58 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.0 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2018. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2018, approximately 68% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contracts. The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions. December 31, 2018 Investments in equity securities Equity index put option contract liabilities December 31, 2017 Investments in equity securities Equity index put option contract liabilities The hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. K-59 Managements Discussion and Analysis (Continued) Interest Rate Risk We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to hedge or manage foreign currency price changes in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. This translation related impact may be offset by gains or losses included in net earnings related to net liabilities of Berkshire and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 follows (in millions). Euro-denominated debt included in net earnings Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We may utilize derivative contracts to manage a portion of commodity price risks at BHE. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See Market Risk Disclosures contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-62. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February 23, 2019 K-61 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Omaha, Nebraska Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for investments in equity securities (excluding equity method investments) in 2018 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. K-62 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued) Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Omaha, Nebraska February 23, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since 1985.

(Berkshire) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service, retailing and finance. In these notes the terms us, we, or our refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 26. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. The Consolidated Financial Statements for periods before 2018 reflect reclassifications to conform to 2018 presentations. Most significantly, line items previously reported under the sub-caption Finance and Financial Products in our Consolidated Financial Statements were reclassified to corresponding line items in the Insurance and Other section. We continue to believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given relative significance of long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. In addition, certain amounts related to equity method investments were reclassified to conform to current year presentations. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (VIE) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. In particular, estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. We classify investments in fixed maturity securities at the acquisition date and re-evaluate the classification at each balance sheet date. We carry held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Trading investments are securities acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our investments in fixed maturity securities were classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. K-69 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) Investment gains and losses arise when fixed maturity securities are sold (as determined on a specific identification basis) or are other-than-temporarily impaired with respect to securities classified as available-for-sale. If the value of a fixed maturity investment declines to below amortized cost and the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the amortized cost of the investment is reduced to fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment if we (a) intend to sell or expect to be required to sell the security before its amortized cost is recovered or (b) do not expect to ultimately recover the amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security. Under scenario (a), we recognize the loss in earnings and under scenario (b), we recognize the credit loss component in earnings and the difference between fair value and the amortized cost basis net of the credit loss in other comprehensive income. We carry substantially all of our investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses. Prior to January 1, 2018, substantially all of our equity security investments were classified as available-for-sale and were also carried at fair value. However, we recorded the periodic changes in fair value of these securities as components of other comprehensive income and we recorded gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when equity securities were sold (on a specific identification basis) or were other-than-temporarily impaired. We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investees book value. Receivables primarily consists of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Allowances for uncollectible balances are provided when it is probable counterparties or customers will be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms. We write-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. Loans and finance receivables are predominantly manufactured housing installment loans. We carry these loans at amortized cost, net of allowances for uncollectible accounts, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Substantially all of our loans and finance receivables are secured by real or personal property or by other assets of the borrower. Allowances for credit losses on loans include estimates of losses on loans currently in foreclosure and losses on loans not currently in foreclosure. We estimate losses on loans in foreclosure based on historical experience and collateral recovery rates. Estimates of losses on loans not currently in foreclosure consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates and prevailing economic conditions. Allowances for credit losses also incorporate the historical average time elapsed from the last payment until foreclosure. K-70 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans in the foreclosure process are considered non-performing. Once a loan is in foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or by our regulated utilities businesses as regulatory assets or liabilities, as applicable, when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods acquired for resale, homes constructed for sale, and materials consumed in business operations. Manufactured inventory costs include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. We used the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method to value approximately 39% of consolidated inventories at December 31, 2018 with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO were approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an equity allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. See Note 1(t). Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend the useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Rail grinding costs related to our railroad properties are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. K-71 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements  5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment  3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other  3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway  9 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment  6 to 41 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems  5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets  3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets  3 to 30 years. We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. We record additions to equipment held for lease at cost. We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 to 35 years. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. There are several methods that may be used to estimate a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value as of the current testing date. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the current estimated fair value of net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all of the underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. K-72 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenues from Contracts with Customers. Except as described in Note 1(w), our revenue recognition practices for contracts with customers under ASC 606 do not differ significantly from prior practices. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due from the customer within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price amongst the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair, and contract incentives which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K-73 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services, or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution services. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements. These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract termination or upon the customers request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts and not ASC 606. The re-characterization of these fractional ownership interests as operating leases did not have a significant effect on our consolidated revenues or earnings. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed under short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) reports of losses from policyholders, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of recoverable amounts under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed under retroactive reinsurance of short duration contracts consistent with other short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts discussed in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability, and we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were $2,658 million and $2,529 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. K-74 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) We compute our liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity, and lapse or withdrawal rates as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contracts date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates range from less than 1% to 7%. Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. Gains or losses from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is not likely. Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial InstrumentsRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, ASU 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and ASC 606. Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 follows (in millions). Increase (decrease): Assets Liabilities Accumulated other comprehensive income Retained earnings Shareholders equity With respect to ASU 2016-01, beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of our equity securities during the period are included within investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized gains and losses in earnings when we sold equity securities and for other-than-temporary impairment losses and we recorded unrealized gains and losses from the changes in fair value of such securities in other comprehensive income. As of January 1, 2018, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified the stranded deferred income tax effects arising from the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2018 to retained earnings. The effect of the reduction in the U.S statutory income tax rate on other comprehensive income items was recorded in earnings in December 2017. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements. These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract termination or upon the customers request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts. The principal effects of this re-characterization were to increase equipment held for lease and aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues by approximately $3.5 billion. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02 Leases, which together with subsequent amendments is included in ASC 842 Leases. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASC 842 also addresses accounting and reporting by lessors, which is not significantly different from current accounting and reporting, and further provides for qualitative and quantitative disclosures. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective method with respect to lease contracts in effect as of the adoption date. We are party to contracts where we are the lessee and other contracts where we are the lessor. For contracts where we are the lessee, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $6 billion as of January 1, 2019, primarily due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities with respect to operating leases. We do not believe the adoption of ASC 842 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses, which provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and for available-for-sale debt securities. Currently, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used in the valuation of policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Under current accounting guidance, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 also requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. In 2016, National Indemnity Company (NICO), a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company (Medical Liability Mutual), a writer of medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. The acquisition price was approximately $2.5 billion. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2018, at which time, Medical Liability Mutuals name was changed to MLMIC Insurance Company (MLMIC). As of the acquisition date, the fair value of MLMICs assets was approximately $6.1 billion, including cash ($230 million) and investments ($5.2 billion), and liabilities were approximately $3.6 billion, consisting primarily of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ($3.2 billion). MLMIC premiums earned for the year ending December 31, 2018 were approximately $400 million. In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as bolt-ons to several of our existing business operations. Aggregate consideration paid for bolt-on acquisitions was approximately $1.0 billion in 2018, $2.7 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 29, 2016, Berkshire acquired all outstanding common stock of Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC) for cash of approximately $32.7 billion, which included the value of PCC shares we already owned. We funded the acquisition with a combination of existing cash balances and proceeds from a temporary credit facility. PCC is a worldwide, diversified manufacturer of complex metal components and products, serving the aerospace, power and general industrial markets. PCC also produces titanium and nickel superalloy melted and mill products for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas and pollution control industries, and manufactures extruded seamless pipe, fittings and forgings for power generation and oil and gas applications. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Significant business acquisitions (Continued) On February 29, 2016, we acquired a recapitalized Duracell Company (Duracell) from The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) in exchange for shares of P&G common stock held by Berkshire subsidiaries, which had a fair value of approximately $4.2 billion. Duracell manufactures high-performance alkaline batteries and wireless charging technologies. Goodwill from these acquisitions is not amortizable for income tax purposes. The fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill at their respective acquisition dates are summarized as follows (in millions). Cash and cash equivalents Inventories Property, plant and equipment Goodwill Other intangible assets Other assets Assets acquired Accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities Notes payable and other borrowings Income taxes, principally deferred Liabilities assumed Net assets Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized by type below (in millions). December 31, 2018 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds Mortgage-backed securities December 31, 2017 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds Mortgage-backed securities Investments in foreign governments include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 88% of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued) The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2018 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Amounts are in millions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to early call or prepayment rights held by issuers. Amortized cost Fair value Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized based on the primary industry of the investee in the table below (in millions). December 31, 2018 * Banks, insurance and finance Consumer products Commercial, industrial and other Approximately 68% of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in five companies (American Express Company  $14.5 billion; Apple Inc.  $40.3 billion; Bank of America Corporation  $22.6 billion; The Coca-Cola Company  $18.9 billion and Wells Fargo & Company  $20.7 billion). December 31, 2017 * Banks, insurance and finance Consumer products Commercial, industrial and other Approximately 65% of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in five companies (American Express Company  $15.1 billion; Apple Inc.  $28.2 billion; Bank of America Corporation  $20.7 billion; The Coca-Cola Company  $18.4 billion and Wells Fargo & Company  $29.3 billion). In 2011, we acquired 50,000 shares of 6% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Bank of America Corporation (BAC) with a liquidation value of $100,000 per share (BAC Preferred) and warrants to purchase up to 700,000,000 shares of common stock of BAC (BAC Warrants) at $7.142857 per share (up to $5 billion in the aggregate). On August 24, 2017, we exercised all of our BAC Warrants and acquired 700,000,000 shares of BAC common stock. We also surrendered substantially all of our BAC Preferred as payment of the $5 billion cost to exercise the BAC Warrants and acquire the BAC common stock. Our investment in BAC is included in the banks, insurance and finance category. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (Kraft Heinz). Kraft Heinz is one of the worlds largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.7% of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $14.0 billion and $25.3 billion, respectively. Our carrying value of this investment at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $13.8 billion and $17.6 billion, respectively. We recorded equity method losses in 2018 of approximately $2.7 billion compared to earnings of $2.9 billion in 2017 and $923 million in 2016. Our losses in 2018 included our share of intangible asset impairment losses recorded by Kraft Heinz. In 2017, our earnings reflected our share of certain one-time effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on Kraft Heinzs net earnings. We received dividends on the common stock of $814 million and $797 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which we recorded as reductions of our investment. Summarized unaudited financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). Assets Liabilities Sales Net earnings (losses) attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (Berkadia), Pilot Travel Centers LLC, d/b/a Pilot Flying J (Pilot Flying J), and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (ETT). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2017. Our equity method earnings in these entities were $563 million in 2018, $76 million in 2017 and $186 million in 2016. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (Jefferies), formerly known as Leucadia National Corporation, owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadias operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $1.5 billion. On December 31, 2018, Berkadias commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50% interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50% interest. On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6% interest in Pilot Flying J, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot Flying J is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North America, with more than 28,000 team members, 750 locations across the U.S. and Canada, and more than $20 billion in annual revenues. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot Flying J and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Flying J with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot Flying J in 2023. K-80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 are summarized below (in millions). Equity securities: Unrealized investment gains/losses on securities held at the end of the period Investment gains/losses during 2018 on securities sold in 2018 Gross realized gains Gross realized losses Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains Gross realized losses Other Prior to 2018, we recognized investment gains and losses in earnings when we sold or otherwise disposed of equity securities based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the cost of the securities and also when we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses. Beginning in 2018, equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. See Note 1(w). Prior to 2018, we recorded the changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities in other comprehensive income. During 2018, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $18.8 billion from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold during 2018 reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold during 2018, which are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and our original cost, were $3.3 billion. Net gains from equity securities in 2017 included approximately $1.0 billion related to the surrender of substantially all of our BAC Preferred as described in Note 4. Gross gains from equity securities in 2016 included approximately $4.2 billion from the redemptions of our investments in Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company and Kraft Heinz preferred stock and from the sale of Dow Chemical Company common stock received in the conversion of our Dow Chemical preferred stock investment. In 2016, we also recorded a non-cash holding gain of approximately $1.1 billion from the exchange of P&G common stock in connection with the acquisition of Duracell. See Note 2. Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions). Loans and finance receivables before allowances and discounts Allowances for uncollectible loans Unamortized acquisition discounts Loans and finance receivables are predominantly installment loans originated or acquired by our manufactured housing business. Provisions for loan losses for 2018 and 2017 were $141 million and $160 million, respectively. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $144 million in 2018 and $162 million in 2017. At December 31, 2018, approximately 98% of the manufactured housing loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment, with the remainder evaluated individually. As part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At December 31, 2018, we considered approximately 99% of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 95% of the loan balances to be current as to payment status. Additionally, during 2018, an insurance subsidiary entered into an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $2.0 billion term loan facility, which matures on July 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding loans under the facility were approximately $1.6 billion. K-81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Other receivables Other receivables of insurance and other businesses are comprised of the following (in millions). Insurance premiums receivable Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses Trade receivables Other Allowances for uncollectible accounts Receivables of our railroad and our utilities and energy businesses are comprised of the following (in millions). Trade receivables Other Allowances for uncollectible accounts Trade receivables include unbilled revenue of $554 million and $665 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, attributable to the regulated utility businesses.

Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Equipment held for lease Equipment held for lease is summarized below (in millions). Equipment held for lease includes railcars, aircraft, over-the-road trailers, intermodal tank containers, cranes, storage units and furniture. In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a net asset of approximately $3.5 billion related to aircraft sold under fractional aircraft ownership programs in aircraft. Such amount included cost of approximately $5.3 billion, net of accumulated depreciation of $1.8 billion. We also recorded other liabilities of approximately $3.5 billion for estimated aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues, substantially offsetting the amount recorded in aircraft. See Note 1(w). Railcars Aircraft Other equipment held for lease Accumulated depreciation Depreciation expense for equipment held for lease was $1,102 million in 2018, $751 million in 2017 and $755 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, the minimum future lease rentals to be received on equipment held for lease were as follows (in millions): 2019  $2,493; 2020  $1,771; 2021  $1,222; 2022  $779; 2023  $421; and thereafter  $377. K-83 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Goodwill and other intangible assets Reconciliations of the changes in the carrying value of goodwill during 2018 and 2017 follows (in millions). Balance at beginning of year Acquisitions of businesses Other, including foreign currency translation Balance at end of year Our other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization are summarized as follows (in millions). Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Trademarks and trade names Patents and technology Customer relationships Other Intangible asset amortization expense was $1,393 million in 2018, $1,469 million in 2017 and $1,490 million in 2016. Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2019  $1,318; 2020  $1,224; 2021  $1,136; 2022  $1,063 and 2023  $1,018. Intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $18.9 billion and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. Currently, the most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions). December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Notional value represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contracts expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. K-84 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Derivative contracts (Continued) We recorded derivative contract losses of $300 million in 2018 and gains of $718 million in 2017, with respect to our equity index put option contracts. The losses in 2018 were primarily due to decreases in equity index values during the fourth quarter. Derivative contract gains in 2016 were $751 million, which included $662 million related to equity index put option contracts and $89 million related to a credit default contract that was terminated. The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. The remaining contracts expire between April 2019 and October 2025. At December 31, 2018, the remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately 1.9 years. In 2018, one equity index put option contract expired and another contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty. These contracts had an aggregate notional value of approximately $1.2 billion. Contracts with notional values of $12.2 billion will expire in 2019. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $4.0 billion on the remaining contracts at the contract inception dates and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $1,653 million at December 31, 2018 and $789 million at December 31, 2017. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. A limited number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshires credit ratings. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshires credit ratings (currently AA from Standard & Poors and Aa2 from Moodys) are downgraded below either A- by Standard & Poors or A3 by Moodys, collateral of up to $1.1 billion could be required to be posted. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets and were $172 million as of December 31, 2018 and $142 million as of December 31, 2017. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $111 million as of December 31, 2018 and $82 million as of December 31, 2017. Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 is presented in the following table (in millions). Cash paid during the period for: Income taxes Interest: Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions Equity securities exchanged in connection with business acquisitions Conversions and other exchanges of investments Equity securities surrendered in connection with warrant exercise K-85 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as claim liabilities) under short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 16), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 is as follows (in millions). Balances  beginning of year: Gross liabilities Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses Net liabilities Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events Prior accident years events Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events Prior accident years events Total payments Foreign currency translation adjustment Business acquisition Balances  end of year: Net liabilities Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses Gross liabilities Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the preceding table were recorded in earnings in each period and related to insured events occurring in the current year (current accident year) and events occurring in all prior years (prior accident years). Current accident year losses in 2018 included $1.6 billion from four significant catastrophe events, while current accident year losses in 2017 included approximately $3 billion from six significant catastrophe events during that year. As discussed in Note 2, NICO acquired MLMIC, a writer of medical professional liability insurance, on October 1, 2018. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses from the net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years were $1,406 million in 2018, $544 million in 2017 and $1,443 million in 2016. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 2.4% in 2018, 1.1% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2016. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years loss events related to primary insurance were decreased $937 million in 2018, $249 million in 2017 and $569 million in 2016. These decreases were primarily attributable to lower than anticipated medical malpractice and workers compensation losses. Liabilities for prior years private passenger auto claims were also reduced in 2018 and 2016, but were increased in 2017. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance were reduced $469 million in 2018, $295 million in 2017 and $874 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was net of increased losses from a United Kingdom government-mandated change to the computation of certain personal injury lump sum settlements and higher than expected property losses. Estimated claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance recoverable, were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2017. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment as described in Note 16. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims. K-86 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as ALAE) of GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2018, follows (in millions). Unpaid losses and ALAE, net Reinsurance recoverable Unpaid unallocated loss adjustment expenses Other unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses GEICO GEICOs claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing an individual case reserve when we have insufficient time or information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish liability case loss estimates, which includes loss adjustment expenses, once the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The claim-tail is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K-87 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) GEICOs incurred and paid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance, are summarized by accident year below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2018. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The Cumulative Number of Reported Claims includes the combined number of reported claims for all policy coverages and excludes projected IBNR claims. Dollars are in millions. Accident Year 2014* 2015* 2016* 2017* 2018 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Accident Year Cumulative Paid Losses and ALAE through December 31, 2014* 2015* 2016* 2017* 2018 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 * Unaudited supplemental information BHRG We use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish BHRGs property and casualty claims liabilities. We use certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates. Estimated IBNR liabilities are driven by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which may be evaluated as groups or portfolios of contracts with similar exposures, or on an individual contract-by-contract basis. Case and IBNR liability estimates for major catastrophe events may be based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided, as such information is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. K-88 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRGs disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year, net of reinsurance. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2018. Dollars are in millions.

Incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability and workers compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2018. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants, and includes claims that ultimately result in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. K-90 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) BH Primary Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the paid and incurred development method, Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, hindsight outstanding severity method, trended severity method and trended pure premium method. Using a combination of these methodologies produces a range of loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. Periodically, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience. As previously noted, MLMIC was acquired on October 1, 2018. MLMICs incurred and paid losses and ALAE are included for all years presented retrospectively. Accident Year Incurred Losses and ALAE through December 31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Accident Year Cumulative Paid Losses and ALAE through December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Unaudited supplemental information K-91 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) BH Primary Workers Compensation and Other Casualty We periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers compensation and other casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

Average Annual Percentage Payout of Incurred Losses by Age, Net of Reinsurance GEICO BHRG Property BHRG Casualty BH Primary Medical Professional Liability BH Primary Workers Compensation and Other Casualty Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, if applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (claim liabilities) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Balances  beginning of year Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Current year contracts Prior years contracts Total Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses Balances  end of year Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value. In 2017, NICO entered into an agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, AIG), which became effective on February 2, 2017. Under this agreement, NICO agreed to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of $25 billion retained by AIG, with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring prior to 2016. As of the effective date, we recorded premiums earned of $10.2 billion, and we also recorded a liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $16.4 billion and a deferred charge reinsurance assumed asset of $6.2 billion. Berkshire agreed to guarantee the timely payment of all amounts due to AIG under the agreement. K-93 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance contracts (Continued) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we increased our estimated ultimate claim liabilities under the aforementioned AIG contract by approximately $1.8 billion based on higher than expected loss payments reported by AIG under the contractual retention. We also increased the related deferred charge asset by $1.7 billion based on our re-estimation of the amounts and timing of future claim payments. The estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract were approximately $18.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2017 and the related deferred charge assets were approximately $6.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and $7.5 billion at December 31, 2017. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $919 million in 2018, $458 million in 2017 and $451 million in 2016, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes. Our retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $13.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and $14.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of December 31, 2018. Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire): U.S. Dollar denominated borrowings due 2019-2047 Euro denominated borrowings due 2020-2035 Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) due 2019-2048 Subsidiary borrowings due 2019-2045 Short-term subsidiary borrowings The carrying value of Berkshires Euro denominated senior notes reflects the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The gains or losses arising from the changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate resulted in pre-tax gains of $366 million in 2018, losses of $990 million in 2017 and gains of $264 million in 2016. The carrying values of the Euro denominated senior notes reflected corresponding decreases with respect to the gains and increases with respect to the losses in those periods. K-94 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain finance subsidiaries. In August 2018, BHFC issued $2.35 billion of 4.2% senior notes due in 2048. During 2018, BHFC repaid $4.6 billion of maturing senior notes. During January 2019, BHFC issued $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049 and repaid $950 million of maturing notes. Such borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In addition to BHFCs borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $1.7 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at December 31, 2018. Generally, Berkshires guarantee of a subsidiarys debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2020-2049 Subsidiary and other debt due 2019-2064 Short-term debt Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2019-2097 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During 2018, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $5.5 billion of long-term debt. The debt issued in 2018 has maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2049 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. Proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repay debt, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. BNSFs borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In 2018, BNSF issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured debentures due in 2048. These debentures have a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. As of December 31, 2018, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $7.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $6.1 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. Debt principal repayments expected during each of the next five years are as follows (in millions). Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Income taxes The liabilities for income taxes reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows (in millions). Currently payable (receivable) Deferred Other K-95 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Income taxes (Continued) On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the statutory U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA also included a one-time tax on certain accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Further, the TCJA includes provisions that, in certain instances, impose U.S. income tax liabilities on future earnings of foreign subsidiaries and limit the deductibility of future interest expenses. The TCJA also provides for accelerated deductions of certain capital expenditures made after September 27, 2017 through bonus depreciation. The application of the TCJA may change due to regulations subsequently issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. Upon the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded a reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $35.6 billion for the effect of the aforementioned change in the U.S. statutory income tax rate. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $29.6 billion and we increased regulatory liabilities of our regulated utility subsidiaries by approximately $6.0 billion for the portion of the deferred income tax liability reduction that we will be required to, effectively, refund to customers in the rate setting process. We also recognized an income tax charge of approximately $1.4 billion with respect to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Thus, upon the enactment of the TCJA, we included a net income tax benefit in our 2017 earnings of approximately $28.2 billion. In 2018, we reduced our estimate of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries by $141 million and recognized additional deferred income tax rate change effects. We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under the current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are shown below (in millions). Deferred tax liabilities: Investments  unrealized appreciation and cost basis differences Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Property, plant and equipment Goodwill and other intangible assets Other Deferred tax assets: Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Unearned premiums Accrued liabilities Regulatory liabilities Other Net deferred tax liability K-96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Income taxes (Continued) Income tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 is as follows (in millions). Federal State Foreign Current Deferred Income tax expense is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 in the table below (in millions).

We are under examination by the taxing authorities in many of these jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (IRS) for tax years through 2011. The IRS continues to audit Berkshires consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2019. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, net unrecognized tax benefits were $549 million and $554 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2018, were $452 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, the differences in recognition periods would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. As of December 31, 2018, we do not expect any material changes to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. Dividend restrictions  Insurance subsidiaries Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $16 billion as ordinary dividends during 2019. Combined shareholders equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $162 billion at December 31, 2018 and $170 billion at December 31, 2017. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and the carrying values of non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes. K-97 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

K-98 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1  Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2  Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3  Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 follow (in millions). Balance December 31, 2015 Gains (losses) included in: Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions Dispositions and settlements Transfers into/out of Level 3 Balance December 31, 2016 Gains (losses) included in: Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Dispositions and settlements Transfers into/out of Level 3 Balance December 31, 2017 Gains (losses) included in: Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions Dispositions and settlements Balance December 31, 2018 K-99 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Fair value measurements (Continued) Gains and losses included in earnings are reported as components of investment gains/losses, derivative gains/losses and other revenues, as appropriate. In 2017 and 2016, gains and losses included in other comprehensive income were primarily the net change in unrealized appreciation of investments and the reclassification of investment appreciation in net earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. As disclosed in Note 4, we exercised our BAC Warrants to acquire BAC common stock on August 24, 2017. As payment of the cost to acquire the BAC common stock, we surrendered substantially all of our BAC Preferred. Additionally, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (RBI) in December 2017, redeemed a $3 billion private placement security that we acquired in 2014. Accordingly, during 2017, we concluded the Level 3 inputs used in the previous fair value determinations of the BAC Warrants, BAC Preferred Stock and RBI investment were not significant and we transferred these measurements from Level 3 to Level 2. Quantitative information as of December 31, 2018, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). Derivative contract liabilities  Equity index put options Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and certain of the contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3 measurements. The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include index price, contract duration and dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using any model is inherently subjective and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and assume that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities. Common stock Changes in Berkshires issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the three years ending December 31, 2018 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Balance December 31, 2015 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a business acquisition Balance December 31, 2016 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a business acquisition Balance December 31, 2017 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a business acquisition Treasury stock acquired Balance at December 31, 2018 K-100 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Common stock (Continued) Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,640,929 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 1,644,846 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshires Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshires Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshires intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshires consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following table summarizes customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions). Other revenues included in our consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues which are not within the scope of ASC 606. Manufactured products: Industrial and commercial products Building products Consumer products Grocery and convenience store distribution Food and beverage distribution Auto sales Other retail and wholesale distribution Service Electricity and natural gas Total Other revenue A summary of the transaction price allocated to the significant unsatisfied remaining performance obligations relating to contracts with expected durations in excess of one year as of December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Electricity and natural gas Other sales and service contracts Pension plans Several of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees. Benefits under the plans are generally based on years of service and compensation, although benefits under certain plans are based on years of service and fixed benefit rates. Our subsidiaries may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements and may also make discretionary contributions. The components of our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years ending December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions). Service cost Interest cost Expected return on plan assets Amortization of actuarial losses and other Net periodic pension expense K-102 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Pension plans (Continued) The accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based on service and compensation prior to the valuation date. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBOs of such plans were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Reconciliations of the changes in plan assets and PBOs related to BHEs pension plans and all other pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2018 are in the following tables (in millions). The costs of pension plans covering employees of certain regulated subsidiaries of BHE are generally recoverable through the regulated rate making process. Benefit obligations Accumulated benefit obligation end of year PBO beginning of year Service cost Interest cost Benefits paid Settlements Actuarial (gains) or losses and other PBO end of year Plan assets beginning of year Employer contributions Benefits paid Actual return on plan assets Settlements Other Plan assets end of year Funded status  net liability The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2018 reflected in assets was $510 million and in liabilities was $2,473 million. At December 31, 2017, the funded status included in assets was $1,176 million and in liabilities was $2,986 million. Weighted average assumptions used in determining PBO and net periodic pension expense were as follows. Discount rate applicable to pension benefit obligations Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets Rate of compensation increase Discount rate applicable to net periodic pension expense Benefits payments expected over the next ten years are as follows (in millions): 2019  $1,017; 2020  $986; 2021  $988; 2022  $991; 2023  $1,001; and 2024 to 2028  $5,027. Sponsoring subsidiaries expect to contribute $193 million to defined benefit pension plans in 2019.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change as a result of changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected invested asset returns over a period of several years. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates. A reconciliation of the pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to defined benefit pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Balance beginning of year Amount included in net periodic pension expense Actuarial gains (losses) and other Balance end of year Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit sharing plans. Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by management. Employer contributions expensed with respect to our defined contribution plans were $1,009 million in 2018, $1,001 million in 2017 and $912 million in 2016. Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. K-104 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Contingencies and Commitments (Continued) We lease certain manufacturing, warehouse, retail and office facilities as well as certain equipment. Rent expense under operating leases was $1,649 million in 2018, $1,579 million in 2017 and $1,573 million in 2016. Future minimum rental payments for operating leases having non-cancellable terms in excess of one year are as follows (in millions). 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 After 2023 Total Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their businesses. The most significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our fractional aircraft ownership business. As of December 31, 2018, estimated future payments under such arrangements were as follows: $15.7 billion in 2019, $4.5 billion in 2020, $3.7 billion in 2021, $3.2 billion in 2022, $2.9 billion in 2023 and $17.3 billion after 2023. Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be obligated to acquire their equity interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2018, we estimate the cost would have been approximately $5.6 billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners. Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, finance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The accompanying business segment information for 2017 and 2016 reflects certain reclassifications to conform to presentations in 2018. Specifically, business units that previously were reported as the finance and financial products segment were reclassified to manufacturing (Clayton Homes and UTLX), services and retailing (CORT and XTRA leasing) and corporate and other (principally investment income). The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses, amortization of certain purchase accounting adjustments related to Berkshires business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.

After a series of transactions in 2015, that interest represented 26.8% of the outstanding common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (Kraft Heinz). Berkshire currently owns 26.7% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. Reference is made to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Berkshires investment in Kraft Heinz. Prior to 2018, the Parent Company issued Euro-denominated senior notes and the aggregate par amount outstanding of these borrowings was 6.85 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The gains and losses from the periodic remeasurement of the Euro notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are included in earnings. Parent Company debt maturities over the next five years are as follows: 2019$752 million; 2020$1,149 million; 2021$2,131 million; 2022$613 million and 2023$3,991 million. Berkshire guarantees debt obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, which as of December 31, 2018, totaled approximately $12.4 billion. Such guarantees are an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations. Berkshire also provides guarantees in connection with equity index put option contracts and certain retroactive reinsurance contracts of subsidiaries. The amounts of subsidiary payments under these contracts, if any, is contingent upon the outcome of future events. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was enacted, which reduced the Parent Companys income tax expense in 2017 by $550 million, primarily due to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities attributable to the lower U.S. statutory rate, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense on certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effects of the TCJA on income tax expense of consolidated subsidiaries is included in undistributed earnings in consolidated subsidiaries.

Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels. Major product categories include: Medicare Advantage. Provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health benefits coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums.

States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our businesses are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. U.S. federal and state and international governments continue to consider and enact various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political environment, could adversely affect our businesses. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. U.S. Federal Laws and Regulation When we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts, which are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. 5 Table of Contents Our businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses are also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations, which may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those who maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations, which require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by the state’s regulation. Our health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain affiliated transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material affiliated transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. Health care-related laws and regulations set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies which oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations which may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws governing the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or which are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving 6 Table of Contents personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws prohibiting specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices, which involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations Optum Rx’s businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies which must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some non-resident states also require us to comply with their laws where pharmaceuticals are delivered. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies which participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Federal and state legislation regulating PBM activities affects both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) use of particular care providers or distribution channels, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. In addition, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations while credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards impacting PBM pharmacy activities. Although these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which performs annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure the bank is 7 Table of Contents in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. Non-U.S. Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services. Our competitors include organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants to our markets and business combinations among our competitors and suppliers also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; and sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS We have obtained trademark registration for the UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare names and logos. We own registrations for certain of our other trademarks in the United States and abroad. We hold a portfolio of patents and have patent applications pending from time to time. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are trademarks owned by us. We disclaim any proprietary interest in the marks and names of others. HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Our nearly 400,000 employees, as of December 31, 2022, including more than 140,000 clinical professionals, are guided by our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our mission and cultural values of integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance align with our long-term business strategy to increase access to care, make care more affordable, enhance the care experience, improve health outcomes and advance health equity. Our mission and values attract individuals who are determined to make a difference – individuals whose talent, innovation, engagement and empowerment are critical in our ability to achieve our mission. Similar to other businesses, in 2022 we experienced moderately higher levels of employment attrition, but due to increased recruiting capacity, upgraded digital capabilities and continued investment in our workforce, we continue to be able to meet the needs of those we serve. We are committed to developing our people and culture by creating an inclusive environment where people of diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives make us better. Our approach is data-driven and leader led and uses enterprise and business scorecards to ensure our leaders are accountable for a consistent focus on hiring, developing, advancing and retaining diverse talent. We have embedded inclusion and diversity throughout our culture, including in our talent acquisition and talent management practices; leadership development; careers; learning and skills; and systems and processes. We strive to maintain a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline by building strong strategic partnerships and outreach through early career programs, internships and apprenticeships. We support career coaching, mentorship and accelerated leadership development programs to ensure mobility and advancement for our diverse talent. To foster an engaged workforce and an inclusive culture, we invest in a broad array of learning and culture development programs. We rely on a shared leadership framework, which clearly and objectively defines our expectations, enables an environment where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow, and helps us identify, develop and deploy talent to help achieve our mission. We prioritize pay equity by regularly evaluating and reviewing our compensation practices by gender, ethnicity and race. Receiving on-going feedback from our team members is another way to strengthen and reinforce a culture of inclusion. Our Employee Experience Index measures an employee’s sense of commitment and belonging to our company and is a metric in the Stewardship section of our annual incentive plan. Our Sustainability Report, which can be accessed on our website at www.unitedhealthgroup.com, provides further information about our people and culture. 8 Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of February 24, 2023, including the business experience of each executive officer during the past five years: Name Age Position Andrew Witty 58 Chief Executive Officer Dirk McMahon 63 President and Chief Operating Officer John Rex 61 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Rupert Bondy 61 Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary Erin McSweeney 58 Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer Thomas Roos 50 Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer Brian Thompson 48 Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Our Board of Directors elects executive officers annually.

You can access our website at www.unitedhealthgroup.com to learn more about our company. We make periodic and current reports and amendments available, free of charge, on our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish these reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Information on or linked to our website is neither part of nor incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other SEC filings. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify. Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual or family served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June of the year before the contract year. Our premium revenue on fully accountable value-based care products at Optum Health is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served. Although we base the commercial, Medicaid and value-based premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. For Optum Health’s fully accountable value-based care, our inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or our 10 Table of Contents inability to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions, penalties, investigations or audits; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences. The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, automate and deploy new technologies to simplify administrative processes and clinical decision making, price our products and services adequately, provide effective service to our customers and consumers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, provide timely payments to care providers, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we or third parties we rely on sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in 11 Table of Contents sophistication, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, detect breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns, negatively affecting our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information security. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; financial fraud schemes; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events which could negatively affect our systems, our customers’ data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. Moreover, there has been an increase in new financial fraud schemes and ransomware attacks on large companies, whereby cybercriminals install malicious software preventing users or the enterprise from accessing computer files, systems or networks and demand payment of a ransom for return of access. In addition, there may be a heightened vulnerability due to the lack of physical supervision and on-site infrastructure for remote workforce operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. We have business continuation and resiliency plans which are maintained, updated and tested regularly in an effort to ensure successful containment and remediation of potential disruptions or cyber events. In the event that our remediation efforts may not be successful, it could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular geographies or product segments, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors which give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, our success in the health care marketplace depends on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services, which are useful and relevant to health care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive and risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage. We may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models, including accelerating the transition of care to value-based models achieving higher quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs and expanding access to virtual and in-home care, could result in competitive disadvantages and loss of market share. Additionally, our competitive position could be adversely affected by a failure to develop satisfactory data and analytics capabilities or provide services focused on these capabilities to our clients. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows also could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. The expected resumption of Medicaid redeterminations may also impact our ability to maintain market share if we are unable to retain or add new consumers to other benefit offerings. 12 Table of Contents If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, it could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could diminish our bargaining power. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); physician group management services organizations (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Our health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In some instances, those providers may dispute the payment for these services and may institute litigation or arbitration. The success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s international operations, depends on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. Further, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 13 Table of Contents We are routinely subject to various legal actions, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. Legal actions to which we are a party have included or in the future could include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment of claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. These actions involve significant defense costs and could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved. We incur expenses to resolve these matters and current and future legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Moreover, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. If we fail to successfully manage our strategic alliances, to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States it could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, governmental actions, such as actions by the FTC or DOJ, may affect our ability to complete our merger and acquisition transactions, which could adversely affect our future growth. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions to meet our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Successful acquisitions are also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition of SCA. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm. If we 14 Table of Contents cannot successfully integrate our acquired businesses and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from those businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. We are subject to risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events, which have and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. Large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other extreme events could result in public health crises or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, financial conditions and results of operations. For example, disruptions in public and private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating costs and ability to provide services to our clients and customers. Additionally, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, our clinical and non-clinical workforce could be impacted resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care or otherwise impact our business operations. For example, COVID-19 has materially impacted our results of operations in previous periods. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs. Government enaction of emergency powers in response to public health crises could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants and we compete for their services and allegiance. Our sales could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 15 Table of Contents A prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum’s financial results. Our failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance. We are dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills, to operate and expand our business. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture, which seeks to foster integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance, could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2022. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. Our investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial or market conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it should become necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $108 billion, representing 44% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 16 Table of Contents Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. We may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business Our business activities in the United States and other countries are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including regulations and licensure requirements related to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPAs. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies. For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of our contracts with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of engagements, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to achieve targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will continue to be considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part and future litigation challenges are possible. Further, the integration of entities we acquire into our businesses may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on proposed rate increases to HHS on many of our products for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 17 Table of Contents We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-U.S. regulatory regimes, which vary by jurisdiction, encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers). For example, our UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual international business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar, while our Banmédica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 18 Table of Contents Many of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, number of people we serve, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been involved, and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who, among other allegations, may claim we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted in, and in the future could result in, adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and may result in PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, claims related to the inherent risks in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the 19 Table of Contents statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribes greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, took effect in September 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Discussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” In Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. 23 Table of Contents Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs; care activity; and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. Medicaid Redeterminations. In December 2022, Congress passed the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill that allows states to resume Medicaid redeterminations beginning in April 2023. Redeterminations will result in a decline in people served through our Medicaid business and an expected increase in people served through our commercial and exchange-based offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people have continued access to benefits. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration. This trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the February 2023 Advance Notice for 2024 rates would result in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, proposed substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, would result in reduced funding and benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served. The MCR decreased due to COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development and business mix. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to productivity gains, partially offset by investments and business mix. 25 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 249,741 $ 222,899 $ 200,875 $ 26,842 12 % Optum Health 71,174 54,065 39,808 17,109 32 Optum Insight 14,581 12,199 10,802 2,382 20 Optum Rx 99,773 91,314 87,498 8,459 9 Optum eliminations (2,760) (2,013) (1,800) (747) 37 Optum 182,768 155,565 136,308 27,203 17 Eliminations (108,347) (90,867) (80,042) (17,480) 19 Consolidated revenues $ 324,162 $ 287,597 $ 257,141 $ 36,565 13 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 14,379 $ 11,975 $ 12,359 $ 2,404 20 % Optum Health 6,032 4,462 3,434 1,570 35 Optum Insight 3,588 3,398 2,725 190 6 Optum Rx 4,436 4,135 3,887 301 7 Optum 14,056 11,995 10,046 2,061 17 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 28,435 $ 23,970 $ 22,405 $ 4,465 19 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 5.8 % 5.4 % 6.2 % 0.4 % Optum Health 8.5 8.3 8.6 0.2 Optum Insight 24.6 27.9 25.2 (3.3) Optum Rx 4.4 4.5 4.4 (0.1) Optum 7.7 7.7 7.4 — Consolidated operating margin 8.8 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 0.5 % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic $ 63,599 $ 60,023 $ 55,872 $ 3,576 6 % UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global (a) 8,668 8,345 7,752 323 4 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total (a) 72,267 68,368 63,624 3,899 6 UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 113,671 100,552 90,764 13,119 13 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 63,803 53,979 46,487 9,824 18 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 249,741 $ 222,899 $ 200,875 $ 26,842 12 % (a) On January 1, 2022, we realigned our operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. 26 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: December 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Commercial - domestic: Risk-based 8,045 7,985 7,910 60 1 % Fee-based 18,640 18,595 18,310 45 — Total commercial - domestic 26,685 26,580 26,220 105 — Medicare Advantage 7,105 6,490 5,710 615 9 Medicaid 8,170 7,655 6,620 515 7 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,375 4,395 4,460 (20) — Total community and senior 19,650 18,540 16,790 1,110 6 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 46,335 45,120 43,010 1,215 3 Commercial - global 5,360 5,510 5,425 (150) (3) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 51,695 50,630 48,435 1,065 2 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,295 3,700 4,045 (405) (11) % Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Earnings from operations increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in the number of people served under value-based care arrangements, cost management initiatives, asset dispositions and COVID-19 effects. Optum Health served approximately 102 million people as of December 31, 2022 compared to 100 million people as of December 31, 2021. Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, with managed services revenue growth driven by business combinations and new health system partnerships. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services, including community health, specialty and home delivery pharmacies. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,438 million and 1,368 million adjusted scripts in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies. Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.8 billion and $8.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 26,206 $ 22,343 $ 22,174 $ 3,863 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments 12,536 2,481 2,586 10,055 Proceeds from common share issuances 1,253 1,355 1,440 (102) Customer funds administered 5,548 622 1,677 4,926 Cash received for dispositions 3,414 15 221 3,399 Total sources of cash 48,957 26,816 28,098 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (21,458) (4,821) (7,139) (16,637) Cash dividends paid (5,991) (5,280) (4,584) (711) Common share repurchases (7,000) (5,000) (4,250) (2,000) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,802) (2,454) (2,051) (348) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (6,837) (1,843) (2,836) (4,994) Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (176) (1,338) — 1,162 Other (2,737) (1,564) (1,186) (1,173) Total uses of cash (47,001) (22,300) (22,046) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 34 (62) (116) 96 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,990 $ 4,454 $ 5,936 $ (2,464) 2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts and increased net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of long-term debt, customer funds administered, primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing and increased HSA deposits, cash received for dispositions and decreased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions, net purchases of investments and common stock repurchases. 28 Table of Contents Financial Condition As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $69.4 billion included $23.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.3 billion was available for general corporate use), $42.3 billion of debt securities and $3.7 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.0 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity Cash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: • Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually. • Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. • Purchase and other obligations. These include $5.6 billion, $2.9 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. • Other liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments. • Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail. We do not have any material expected redemptions in the next twelve months. We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 29 Table of Contents Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Positive A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 31 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Dividends. In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Pending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. We completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2022, 2021 and 2020 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $410 million, $1.7 billion and $880 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. 30 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2022: Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 765 (0.50) 508 (0.25) 254 0.25 (252) 0.50 (503) 0.75 (753) Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2022: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 985 2 656 1 328 (1) (328) (2) (656) (3) (985) The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2022 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2022 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $215 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. 31 Table of Contents We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2022, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. As of December 31, 2022, we had $31 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2022, $16 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, $38 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $43 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. 32 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 629 $ 327 $ (3,390) $ (7,365) 1 314 164 (1,746) (4,002) (1) (314) (135) 1,838 4,808 (2) (629) (266) 3,746 10,641 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 499 $ 133 $ (3,080) $ (8,664) 1 250 67 (1,564) (4,723) (1) (85) (7) 1,398 5,655 (2) (85) (7) 1,857 10,892 Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero. We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s international business operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $560 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 3.7 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description Medical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s IBNR balance was $20 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles. We identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. 35 Table of Contents How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process. • We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. • With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: ◦ Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. ◦ Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate. ◦ Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2022 with dates of service in 2021 or prior. / S / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 24, 2023 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. 36 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Consolidated Balance

Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available. The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. 42 Table of Contents Products and Services For the Company’s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. Services revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, accounts receivables related to products and services were $ 7.1 billion and $ 5.4 billion, respectively. In 2022 and 2021, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $ 12.5 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years. See Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2022. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90 % of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and 43 Table of Contents demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. Pursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. 44 Table of Contents The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $ 8.2 billion and $ 7.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s Medicare Part D receivables amounted to $ 1.3 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively. Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets include pharmaceutical drug and supplies inventory of $ 3.5 billion and $ 2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Operating Leases The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet . Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 45 Table of Contents Intangible Assets The Company’s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($ 13.5 billion and $ 11.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively), accruals for premium rebates payable, the RSF associated with the AARP Program, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside of the Company’s control are classified as temporary equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares, which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated redemption value is not material. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: (in millions) 2022 2021 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period $ 1,434 $ 2,211 Net earnings 113 87 Acquisitions 3,108 28 Redemptions ( 176 ) ( 1,338 ) Distributions ( 82 ) ( 255 ) Fair value and other adjustments 500 701 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period $ 4,897 $ 1,434 Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years, and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. 46 Table of Contents 3.

The Company held $ 3.7 billion and $ 3.5 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material. 47 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2022, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 4,713 $ 4,682 $ 374 $ 369 Due after one year through five years 13,135 12,404 265 256 Due after five years through ten years 12,210 10,897 37 36 Due after ten years 5,412 4,968 20 18 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 7,379 6,586 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,077 2,784 — — Total debt securities $ 45,926 $ 42,321 $ 696 $ 679 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses December 31, 2022 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,007 $ ( 96 ) $ 1,290 $ ( 189 ) $ 3,297 $ ( 285 ) State and municipal obligations 4,630 ( 288 ) 1,178 ( 191 ) 5,808 ( 479 ) Corporate obligations 13,003 ( 893 ) 6,637 ( 905 ) 19,640 ( 1,798 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,561 ( 345 ) 2,239 ( 463 ) 5,800 ( 808 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,698 ( 128 ) 976 ( 166 ) 2,674 ( 294 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 24,899 $ ( 1,750 ) $ 12,320 $ ( 1,914 ) $ 37,219 $ ( 3,664 ) December 31, 2021 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,976 $ ( 18 ) $ 249 $ ( 13 ) $ 2,225 $ ( 31 ) State and municipal obligations 1,386 ( 19 ) 31 ( 1 ) 1,417 ( 20 ) Corporate obligations 9,357 ( 130 ) 376 ( 15 ) 9,733 ( 145 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,078 ( 52 ) 116 ( 3 ) 3,194 ( 55 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,321 ( 18 ) 114 ( 5 ) 1,435 ( 23 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 17,118 $ ( 237 ) $ 886 $ ( 37 ) $ 18,004 $ ( 274 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2022 were generated from approximately 35,000 positions out of a total of 41,000 positions. The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material. 4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. 48 Table of Contents The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: • Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); • Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and • Inputs corroborated by other observable market data. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 211 million and $ 840 million, respectively, of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in our venture portfolio, based upon transaction of the same or similar security. There were no other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt securities and equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding. Assets Under Management.

The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 490 million expire beginning in 2023 through 2037 and $ 611 million have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2023 through 2042, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. 57 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 2,310 $ 1,829 $ 1,423 Gross increases: Current year tax positions 586 538 416 Prior year tax positions 206 10 120 Gross decreases: Prior year tax positions ( 21 ) ( 47 ) ( 130 ) Statute of limitations lapses — ( 20 ) — Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 3,081 $ 2,310 $ 1,829 The Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $ 260 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $ 64 million, $ 66 million and $ 52 million of net interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $ 253 million and $ 194 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2022, there were $ 1.7 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2014 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.8 billion, including $ 7.4 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.0 billion, including $ 4.7 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $ 33.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $ 15.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2022, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.” 58 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2018, the Board of Directors renewed the Company’s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Common share repurchases, shares 14 13 Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 501.67 $ 389.92 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 7,000 $ 5,000 Board authorized shares remaining 31 45 Dividends In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2021. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 59 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2022, there were 18 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Stock Options Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is summarized in the table below: Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) (in years) (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period 25 $ 241 Granted 4 459 Exercised ( 5 ) 215 Forfeited ( 1 ) 356 Outstanding at end of period 23 281 5.8 $ 5,914 Exercisable at end of period 13 213 4.4 4,170 Vested and expected to vest, end of period 23 278 5.7 5,854 59 Table of Contents Restricted Shares Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is summarized in the table below: (shares in millions) Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period 4 $ 303 Granted 2 483 Vested ( 2 ) 287 Nonvested at end of period 4 401 Other Share-Based Compensation Data (in millions, except per share amounts) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Stock Options Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share $ 116 $ 71 $ 54 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised 1,419 1,519 1,736 Restricted Shares Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share 483 352 303 Total fair value of restricted shares vested $ 760 $ 560 $ 574 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Number of shares purchased 1 1 1 Share-Based Compensation Items Share-based compensation expense, before tax $ 925 $ 800 $ 679 Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects 836 719 619 Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises 207 173 208 (in millions, except years) December 31, 2022 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards $ 1,165 Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense 1.3 Share-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 1.9% - 4.3% 0.7% - 1.2% 0.2% - 1.4% Expected volatility 30.6% -30.8% 29.2% - 29.8% 22.2% - 29.5% Expected dividend yield 1.2% 1.3% - 1.5% 1.4% - 1.7% Forfeiture rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Expected life in years 4.7 4.8 5.1 Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represents the period of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. 60 Table of Contents Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020. In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 12. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs, including immaterial variable and short-term lease costs, were $ 1.3 billion, $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $ 996 million, $ 921 million and $ 865 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were classified within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.6 years and 3.4 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Minimum Lease Payments 2023 $ 997 2024 858 2025 702 2026 578 2027 475 Thereafter 2,028 Total future minimum lease payments 5,638 Less imputed interest ( 808 ) Total $ 4,830 Other Commitments The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. Pending Acquisitions As of December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 9 billion. The Company completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023. Legal Matters The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to 61 Table of Contents estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. 13. Business Combinations On October 3, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Change Healthcare Inc. (Change) and funded Change’s payoff of its outstanding debt and credit facility for a total of $ 13.9 billion in cash. The combination of the Company and Change will connect and simplify the core clinical, administrative and payment processes health care providers and payers depend on to serve patients. Change brings key technologies, connections and advanced clinical decision, administrative and financial support capabilities, enabling better workflow and transactional connectivity across the health care system. Subsequent to closing and as planned, the Company sold Change’s claims editing business to an affiliate of investment funds of TPG Inc. for $ 2.2 billion in cash. The net assets and net liabilities associated with this sale were classified as held-for-sale at the time of acquisition. There was no gain or loss associated with this transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed several other business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.8 billion. The Company also sold other businesses for $ 1.2 billion of cash, with a carrying value of $ 600 million, and the difference reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 62 Table of Contents Acquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Change Other Acquisitions Total Cash and cash equivalents $ 222 $ 523 $ 745 Accounts receivable and other current assets 925 696 1,621 Assets held-for-sale 2,310 — 2,310 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 254 1,882 2,136 Other intangible assets 4,050 1,764 5,814 Total identifiable assets acquired 7,761 4,865 12,626 Medical costs payable — ( 308 ) ( 308 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 1,017 ) ( 843 ) ( 1,860 ) Liabilities held-for-sale ( 101 ) — ( 101 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 1,193 ) ( 713 ) ( 1,906 ) Total identifiable liabilities acquired ( 2,311 ) ( 1,864 ) ( 4,175 ) Total net identifiable assets 5,450 3,001 8,451 Goodwill 8,496 9,214 17,710 Redeemable noncontrolling interests — ( 3,108 ) ( 3,108 ) Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests — ( 370 ) ( 370 ) Net assets acquired $ 13,946 $ 8,737 $ 22,683 The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to finite-lived intangible assets acquired consisted of the following: Change Other Acquisitions Total (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer-related $ 3,063 15 years $ 864 13 years $ 3,927 15 years Trademarks and technology 977 6 years 81 4 years 1,058 6 years Other 10 1 year 766 13 years 776 13 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets $ 4,050 13 years $ 1,711 13 years $ 5,761 13 years The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2022, acquired entities impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2021, were immaterial for both periods. 63 Table of Contents 14. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s four reportable segments derives its revenues: • UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. Domestically, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for employers and individuals. Globally, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employers and individuals in South America and other diversified global businesses. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs. UnitedHealthcare Community & State provides diversified health care benefits products and services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage. • Optum Health focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. Optum Health is building a comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their health through in-person, in-home, virtual and digital clinical platforms. • Optum Insight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. • Optum Rx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. Optum Rx integrates pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing. The Company’s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by Optum Rx; care delivery, care management services and certain product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health; and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 38 %, 36 % and 36 % for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 97 % of consolidated total revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 81 % and 78 % of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s international businesses. 64 Table of Contents The following table presents the reportable segment financial information: Optum (in millions) UnitedHealthcare Optum Health Optum Insight Optum Rx Optum Eliminations Optum Corporate and Eliminations Consolidated 2022 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 238,783 $ 18,374 $ — $ — $ — $ 18,374 $ — $ 257,157 Products — 72 180 37,172 — 37,424 — 37,424 Services 10,035 10,917 4,996 1,603 — 17,516 — 27,551 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 248,818 29,363 5,176 38,775 — 73,314 — 322,132 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 40,883 9,288 60,936 ( 2,760 ) 108,347 ( 108,347 ) — Investment and other income 923 928 117 62 — 1,107 — 2,030 Total revenues $ 249,741 $ 71,174 $ 14,581 $ 99,773 $ ( 2,760 ) $ 182,768 $ ( 108,347 ) $ 324,162 Earnings from operations $ 14,379 $ 6,032 $ 3,588 $ 4,436 $ — $ 14,056 $ — $ 28,435 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 2,092 ) ( 2,092 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 14,379 $ 6,032 $ 3,588 $ 4,436 $ — $ 14,056 $ ( 2,092 ) $ 26,343 Total assets $ 107,094 $ 68,950 $ 31,090 $ 47,476 $ — $ 147,516 $ ( 8,905 ) $ 245,705 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 799 997 698 308 — 2,003 — 2,802 Depreciation and amortization 973 943 841 643 — 2,427 — 3,400 2021 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 212,381 $ 13,852 $ — $ — $ — $ 13,852 $ — $ 226,233 Products — 32 159 34,246 — 34,437 — 34,437 Services 9,661 9,894 3,936 1,112 — 14,942 — 24,603 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 222,042 23,778 4,095 35,358 — 63,231 — 285,273 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 29,234 7,867 55,779 ( 2,013 ) 90,867 ( 90,867 ) — Investment and other income 857 1,053 237 177 — 1,467 — 2,324 Total revenues $ 222,899 $ 54,065 $ 12,199 $ 91,314 $ ( 2,013 ) $ 155,565 $ ( 90,867 ) $ 287,597 Earnings from operations $ 11,975 $ 4,462 $ 3,398 $ 4,135 $ — $ 11,995 $ — $ 23,970 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,660 ) ( 1,660 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 11,975 $ 4,462 $ 3,398 $ 4,135 $ — $ 11,995 $ ( 1,660 ) $ 22,310 Total assets $ 102,967 $ 60,474 $ 16,868 $ 40,181 $ — $ 117,523 $ ( 8,284 ) $ 212,206 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 795 791 567 301 — 1,659 — 2,454 Depreciation and amortization 1,004 818 684 597 — 2,099 — 3,103 2020 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 191,679 $ 9,799 $ — $ — $ — $ 9,799 $ — $ 201,478 Products — 33 135 33,977 — 34,145 — 34,145 Services 8,464 6,815 3,687 1,050 — 11,552 — 20,016 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 200,143 16,647 3,822 35,027 — 55,496 — 255,639 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 22,481 6,941 52,420 ( 1,800 ) 80,042 ( 80,042 ) — Investment and other income 732 680 39 51 — 770 — 1,502 Total revenues $ 200,875 $ 39,808 $ 10,802 $ 87,498 $ ( 1,800 ) $ 136,308 $ ( 80,042 ) $ 257,141 Earnings from operations $ 12,359 $ 3,434 $ 2,725 $ 3,887 $ — $ 10,046 $ — $ 22,405 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,663 ) ( 1,663 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 12,359 $ 3,434 $ 2,725 $ 3,887 $ — $ 10,046 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 20,742 Total assets $ 98,229 $ 52,073 $ 15,425 $ 39,280 $ — $ 106,778 $ ( 7,718 ) $ 197,289 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 687 715 461 188 — 1,364 — 2,051 Depreciation and amortization 920 703 670 598 — 1,971 — 2,891 65 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 66 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2022 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. 67 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2022. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 24, 2023 68 Table of Contents ITEM 9B.

As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides access to medical services for 26.6 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners, including employer customers, serving people across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. Products are offered through affiliates licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or TPAs. Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers who elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees’ dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision professionals. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals served by UnitedHealth Group makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has relationships with network care providers who integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payment arrangements and care management programs that enable us to jointly better manage health care and improve quality across populations. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s comprehensive and integrated pharmacy care services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs offering improved value and outcomes, helping consumers take actions to improve their health and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual typically distributes its products through a variety of channels, dependent upon the specific product, including: through consultants or direct sales, in collaboration with brokers and agents, through wholesale agents or agencies who contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits, through professional employer organizations and associations and through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s diverse product portfolio offers employers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement which provides the flexibility to meet a full spectrum of their coverage needs.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s clinical programs include: wellness programs, decision support, utilization management, case and disease management, complex condition management, on-site programs, incentives to reinforce positive behavior change, mental health/substance use disorder management and employee assistance programs.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has distinct benefit designs, pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a selection of products allowing people choice in obtaining the health coverage and services they need as their circumstances change. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is positioned to serve seniors who find affordable, network-based care provided through Medicare Advantage plans to meet their unique health care needs. For those who prefer traditional fee-for-service Medicare, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers both Medicare 4 Table of Contents Supplement and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) programs to expand their government-sponsored Medicare by providing additional benefits and coverage options. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offerings include care management and health system navigator services, clinical management programs, nurse health line services, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients, including AARP, the nation’s largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s major product categories include: Medicare Advantage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 6.5 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2021. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. We have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed more than 2.1 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2021 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software and digital therapeutics for remote monitoring enabling clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information bridging capabilities across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans to help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people’s needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.5 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.7 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. Medicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is currently serving 4.4 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program. Premium revenues from CMS represented 36% of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community & State UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare Community & State participated in programs in 32 states and the District of Columbia, and served 7.7 million people; including nearly 1.4 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 18 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). 5 Table of Contents States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation, including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community & State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community & State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants affecting people’s health status and health system usage. Although approximately 80% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, there remains significant growth opportunity as this population represents only approximately 55% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care, including DSNP and LTSS programs. Our offerings to state expansion cover more medically complex populations, including integrated care management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. UnitedHealthcare Community & State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model enables UnitedHealthcare Community & State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care. UnitedHealthcare Global UnitedHealthcare Global serves 7.8 million people with medical and dental benefits, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, but also in more than 150 other countries. UnitedHealthcare Global serves multinational and local businesses, governments, insurers and individuals and their families through health insurance plans for local populations, care delivery services, benefit plans and risk and assistance solutions.

Lusíadas Saúde provides clinical services to people in Portugal through an owned network of hospitals and outpatient clinics. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our businesses are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly among jurisdictions and the interpretation of them are subject to frequent change. Domestic U.S. and international governments continue to consider and enact various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our businesses. If we fail to comply with, are alleged to have failed to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. 6 Table of Contents U.S. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. In addition, our businesses are subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. Our businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses are also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations, which may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those who maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations, which require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by the state’s regulation. Our health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain affiliated transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance 7 Table of Contents holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material affiliated transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations which set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies which oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations which may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws governing the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or which are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws prohibiting specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices, which involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations Optum Rx’s businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies which must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some non-resident states also require us to comply with their laws where pharmaceuticals are delivered. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies which participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Federal and state legislation of PBM activities affects both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) requirements to use particular care providers or distribution channel, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. 8 Table of Contents Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. Additionally, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations while credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards impacting PBM pharmacy activities. Although these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. Non-U.S. Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services, including organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants and business combinations also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; and sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS We have obtained trademark registration for the UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare names and logos. We own registrations for certain of our other trademarks in the United States and abroad. We hold a portfolio of patents and have patent applications pending from time to time. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are trademarks owned by us. We disclaim any proprietary interest in the marks and names of others. 9 Table of Contents HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Our 350,000 employees, as of December 31, 2021, including nearly 135,000 clinical professionals, are guided by our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our mission and cultural values of integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance align with our long-term business strategy to increase access to care, make care more affordable, enhance the care experience and improve health outcomes. Our mission and values attract individuals who are determined to make a difference – individuals whose talent, innovation, engagement and empowerment are critical in our ability to achieve our mission. Similar to other businesses, in 2021 we have experienced moderately higher levels of employment attrition and COVID-19 continues to drive unplanned absences, but due to increased recruiting capacity and upgraded digital capabilities our workforce continues to be able to meet the needs of those we serve. We are committed to developing our people and culture by creating an inclusive environment where people of diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives make us better. Our approach is data-driven and leader led, including enterprise and business scorecards ensuring our leaders are accountable for a consistent focus on hiring, developing, advancing and retaining diverse talent. We have embedded inclusion and diversity throughout our culture, including in our talent acquisition and talent management practices; leadership development; careers; learning and skills; and systems and processes. We strive to maintain a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline by building strong strategic partnerships and outreach through early career programs, internships and apprenticeships. We support career coaching, mentorship and accelerated leadership development programs to ensure mobility and advancement for our diverse talent. To foster an engaged workforce and an inclusive culture, we invest in a broad array of learning and culture development programs. We rely on a shared leadership framework, which clearly and objectively defines our expectations, enables an environment where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow, and helps us identify, develop and deploy talent to help achieve our mission. We prioritize pay equity by regularly evaluating and reviewing our compensation practices by gender, ethnicity and race. Receiving on-going feedback from our team members is another way to strengthen and reinforce a culture of inclusion. Our Employee Experience Index measures an employee’s sense of commitment and belonging to the Company and is a metric in the Stewardship section of our annual incentive plan. Our Sustainability Report, which can be accessed on our website at www.unitedheatlhgroup.com, provides further details on our people and culture.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or 11 Table of Contents communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify. Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities. The future impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and treatments, factors which remain uncertain at this time. These factors continue to affect the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. We may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. The premiums and fees we charge, including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions, may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services. Similarly, state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement (such as requirements for insurers to cover at-home COVID-19 testing).We have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers, health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. In addition, our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ, resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care and related partial or full closures of our facilities. Our non-clinical workforce may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures impacting our business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some of our customers having to temporarily or permanently close or severely curtail their operations, and unfavorable economic conditions resulting from the pandemic may continue to impact our clients, customers, health care providers, third party vendors and federal and state entities and programs. Among other impacts, we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments. In addition, governments have modified, and may continue to modify, regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to COVID-19, which may adversely affect our ability to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations. Further disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs. Additionally, the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. Although we cannot predict the pacing, intensity and duration of COVID-19, the pandemic’s disruption to business activities, employment and economic effects, and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business negotiates value-based arrangements with commercial third-party payers which are also included in premium revenues. Under a typical arrangement, Optum Health receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 12 Table of Contents We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, such as COVID-19, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2021 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2021 would have been reduced by approximately $330 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, price adequately our products and services, provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential 13 Table of Contents information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place which are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, detect breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns, negatively affecting our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information security. In addition, we are subject to heightened vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks associated with increased numbers of employees working from home. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; financial fraud schemes; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events which could negatively affect our systems, our customers’ data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular geographies or segments, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors which give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services, which are useful and relevant to health care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive, and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage. We may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models, including accelerating the transition of care to value-based models and expanding access to virtual care, could result in competitive disadvantages and loss of market share. Additionally, our competitive position could be adversely affected by a failure to develop satisfactory data and analytics capabilities or provide services focused on these capabilities to our clients. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we fail to realize competitive advantages resulting from collaboration between our businesses, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or 14 Table of Contents demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Our health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in other cases the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us. The success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 15 Table of Contents We are routinely subject to various legal actions, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs and, if these actions are asserted against us, could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions, which further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities 16 Table of Contents and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group benefits and pharmacy services plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum’s financial results. Our failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance. We are dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, to operate and expand our business. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture, which seeks to foster integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance, could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives 17 Table of Contents will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2021. Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. Our investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $86 billion, representing 40% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. We may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct 18 Table of Contents business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies. For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will continue to be considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part and future litigation challenges are possible. Further, the integration into our businesses of entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) which vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Global business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar, while our Banmédica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely 19 Table of Contents affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 20 Table of Contents CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who, among other allegations, may claim we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted in, and in the future could result in, adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Additionally, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations 21 Table of Contents and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) overhauled data protection laws in the European Union. GDPR has imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, took effect in September 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES To support our business operations in the United States and other countries we own and lease real properties.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ” Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and pricing trends; we also believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. 25 Table of Contents Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care costs as well as the deferral of care have impacted medical cost trends in 2021 and may continue to do so in 2022 and subsequent years. Future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying performance-based care provider payment models rewarding high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. This trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 4.1%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. ACA Tax (Health Insurance Tax). The Health Insurance Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. The permanent repeal of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. In 2021, overall care activity continued to increase, including a mix of temporary deferral of care activity and COVID-19 related care costs. The temporary deferral of care was more than offset by COVID-19 related care and testing costs, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts and general economic impacts. In future periods, care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained and acuity temporarily rises due to missed regular care. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: Optum. COVID-19 related care costs continued to impact our Optum Health value-based care delivery businesses, which were partially offset by the continued temporary deferral of care. The temporary deferral of care reduced fee-for-service care delivery volume, as well as Optum Insight and Optum Rx volume-based business activity, although we expect the impact to continue decreasing as care returns to, and potentially exceeds, normal levels. We believe COVID-19 will continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how and where care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain. 26 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare. In 2021, we continued expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 related care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy; we also continued to assist our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. UnitedHealthcare’s 2021 results of operations were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related care and testing, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts, as well as broader economic impacts, partially offset by the continued deferral of care. The increase in people served through Medicaid was attributable in part to continuing action by states to ease eligibility redetermination requirements due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have affected and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing, intensity and duration of the pandemic, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccination and treatments and general economic uncertainty.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial offerings, as well as increased COVID-19 related care costs and medical cost trends, partially offset by higher temporary care deferrals. The MCR increased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by increased temporary care deferrals. Medical costs and the MCR were also impacted by increased prior year favorable reserve development. 28 Table of Contents Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, COVID-19 impacts on revenue and operating costs in the prior year and operating efficiency gains, partially offset by business mix. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplement ary Data ” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the mix of care delivered through accountable care models at Optum Health, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs. 2020 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 222,899 $ 200,875 $ 193,842 $ 22,024 11 % Optum Health 54,065 39,808 30,317 14,257 36 Optum Insight 12,199 10,802 10,006 1,397 13 Optum Rx 91,314 87,498 74,288 3,816 4 Optum eliminations (2,013) (1,800) (1,661) (213) 12 Optum 155,565 136,308 112,950 19,257 14 Eliminations (90,867) (80,042) (64,637) (10,825) 14 Consolidated revenues $ 287,597 $ 257,141 $ 242,155 $ 30,456 12 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 11,975 $ 12,359 $ 10,326 $ (384) (3) % Optum Health 4,462 3,434 2,963 1,028 30 Optum Insight 3,398 2,725 2,494 673 25 Optum Rx 4,135 3,887 3,902 248 6 Optum 11,995 10,046 9,359 1,949 19 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 23,970 $ 22,405 $ 19,685 $ 1,565 7 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 5.4 % 6.2 % 5.3 % (0.8) % Optum Health 8.3 8.6 9.8 (0.3) Optum Insight 27.9 25.2 24.9 2.7 Optum Rx 4.5 4.4 5.3 0.1 Optum 7.7 7.4 8.3 0.3 Consolidated operating margin 8.3 % 8.7 % 8.1 % (0.4) % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs. 2020 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 60,023 $ 55,872 $ 56,945 $ 4,151 7 % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 100,552 90,764 83,252 9,788 11 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 53,979 46,487 43,790 7,492 16 UnitedHealthcare Global 8,345 7,752 9,855 593 8 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 222,899 $ 200,875 $ 193,842 $ 22,024 11 % 29 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: December 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs. 2020 Commercial: Risk-based 7,985 7,910 8,575 75 1 % Fee-based 18,595 18,310 19,185 285 2 Total commercial 26,580 26,220 27,760 360 1 Medicare Advantage 6,490 5,710 5,270 780 14 Medicaid 7,655 6,620 5,900 1,035 16 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,395 4,460 4,500 (65) (1) Total community and senior 18,540 16,790 15,670 1,750 10 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 45,120 43,010 43,430 2,110 5 Global 5,510 5,425 5,720 85 2 Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 50,630 48,435 49,150 2,195 5 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,700 4,045 4,405 (345) (9) % Commercial business increased primarily due to acquisitions in risk-based and fee-based offerings and organic growth in innovative products. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2021 compared to 98 million people as of December 31, 2020. Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, including expanding relationships serving health systems. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies. Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs. 2020 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 22,343 $ 22,174 $ 18,463 $ 169 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments 2,481 2,586 3,994 (105) Proceeds from common share issuances 1,355 1,440 1,037 (85) Customer funds administered 622 1,677 13 (1,055) Other — — 219 — Total sources of cash 26,801 27,877 23,726 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (4,821) (7,139) (8,343) 2,318 Cash dividends paid (5,280) (4,584) (3,932) (696) Common share repurchases (5,000) (4,250) (5,500) (750) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,454) (2,051) (2,071) (403) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,843) (2,836) (2,504) 993 Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (1,338) — (618) (1,338) Other (1,549) (965) (619) (584) Total uses of cash (22,285) (21,825) (23,587) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (62) (116) (20) 54 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,454 $ 5,936 $ 119 $ (1,482) 2021 Cash Flows Compared to 2020 Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities were largely consistent, with higher net earnings being offset by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included decreased customer funds administered and increased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, share repurchases and cash dividends paid, partially offset by decreased cash paid for acquisitions and net purchases of investments. 31 Table of Contents Financial Condition As of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity Cash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: • Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually. • Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. • Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. • Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments. • Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months. We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ” Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ” 32 Table of Contents Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2021 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 45 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements. and Supplementary Data . ” Dividends. In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2020. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements. and Supplementary Data . ” Pending Acquisitions. In 2021, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2022, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $12 billion. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion, $880 million and $580 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service 33 Table of Contents to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. Our judgments also consider the impacts of COVID-19 on these factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2021: Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 686 (0.50) 456 (0.25) 228 0.25 (226) 0.50 (452) 0.75 (676) Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, which included consideration of COVID-19. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2021: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 895 2 597 1 298 (1) (298) (2) (597) (3) (895) The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2021; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2021 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2021 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $184 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .” Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost 34 Table of Contents factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates, cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market. The peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value. As of October 1, 2021, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2021, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. As of December 31, 2021, we had $25 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2021, $7 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, $37 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $45 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. 35 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 499 $ 133 $ (3,080) $ (8,664) 1 250 67 (1,564) (4,723) (1) (85) (7) 1,398 5,655 (2) (85) (7) 1,857 10,892 December 31, 2020 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 401 $ 163 $ (3,020) $ (8,700) 1 201 82 (1,499) (4,744) (1) (75) (12) 820 5,266 (2) (75) (12) 886 8,101 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $520 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2021, we had $ 3.5 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

Segment Financial Information 64 37 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description Medical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the Company’s IBNR balance was $17 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels, processing cycles, and consideration of COVID-19. We identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process. 38 Table of Contents • We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. • With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: ◦ Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. ◦ Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate. ◦ Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2021 with dates of service in 2020 or prior. Goodwill - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description At December 31, 2021, the Company’s goodwill balance was $76 billion. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The annual impairment test indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date; therefore, no impairment was recognized. We identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the valuation, business, and market assumptions including the discount rate, financial forecasts, and peer group used by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units where a quantitative analysis was performed, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management’s financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates, company specific risks, peer companies, and market multiples. • We evaluated management’s ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing: ◦ Actual results to historical forecasts. ◦ Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers. • We evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from the October 1, 2021 annual measurement date to December 31, 2021. • We evaluated management’s selection of peer companies and market multiples. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, (2) the weighting of such valuation methodologies, and (3) discount rate and company specific risks by: ◦ Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. ◦ Developing a range of independent discount rate estimates and comparing to those selected by management. / S / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 15, 2022 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. 39 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group

Description of Business UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for the individuals enrolled. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available. The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. 45 Table of Contents Products and Services For the Company’s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Company’s home delivery, specialty and community pharmacies. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its Optum Rx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member’s applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue are comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. Services revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accounts receivables related to products and services were $ 5.4 billion and $ 5.3 billion, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material. See Note 13 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2021. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90 % of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial 46 Table of Contents models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19. In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. Pursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. 47 Table of Contents The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $ 7.2 billion and $ 6.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s Medicare Part D receivables amounted to $ 3.4 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Operating Leases The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, discount rates and the selection of comparable peer companies. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Intangible Assets The Company’s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 48 Table of Contents Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($ 11.4 billion and $ 10.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively), accruals for premium rebates payable, the RSF associated with the AARP Program, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: (in millions) 2021 2020 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period $ 2,211 $ 1,726 Net earnings 87 112 Acquisitions 28 321 Redemptions ( 1,338 ) — Distributions ( 255 ) ( 149 ) Fair value and other adjustments 701 201 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period $ 1,434 $ 2,211 Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. ACA Tax The Health Insurance Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. The permanent repeal of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. 49 Table of Contents 3.

The Company held $ 3.5 billion and $ 2.3 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was not material. 50 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2021, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 2,603 $ 2,614 $ 235 $ 236 Due after one year through five years 12,885 13,065 355 354 Due after five years through ten years 11,342 11,524 28 29 Due after ten years 4,152 4,275 23 24 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 5,868 5,901 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,819 2,838 — — Total debt securities $ 39,669 $ 40,217 $ 641 $ 643 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses December 31, 2021 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,976 $ ( 18 ) $ 249 $ ( 13 ) $ 2,225 $ ( 31 ) State and municipal obligations 1,386 ( 19 ) 31 ( 1 ) $ 1,417 $ ( 20 ) Corporate obligations 9,357 ( 130 ) 376 ( 15 ) 9,733 ( 145 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,078 ( 52 ) 116 ( 3 ) 3,194 ( 55 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,321 ( 18 ) 114 ( 5 ) 1,435 ( 23 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 17,118 $ ( 237 ) $ 886 $ ( 37 ) $ 18,004 $ ( 274 ) December 31, 2020 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 346 $ ( 3 ) $ — $ — $ 346 $ ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,273 ( 9 ) 456 ( 3 ) 1,729 ( 12 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 601 ( 3 ) — — 601 ( 3 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 195 ( 1 ) 93 ( 3 ) 288 ( 4 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,415 $ ( 16 ) $ 549 $ ( 6 ) $ 2,964 $ ( 22 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2021 were generated from approximately 13,000 positions out of a total of 39,000 positions. The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was not material. 4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. 51 Table of Contents The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: • Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); • Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and • Inputs corroborated by other observable market data. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $ 840 million of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in our venture portfolio, based on transactions of the same or similar security. There were no other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding. Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt and equity securities. 52 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt securities.

Income Taxes The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows: (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Current Provision: Federal $ 3,451 $ 4,098 $ 2,629 State and local 481 392 319 Foreign 516 491 564 Total current provision 4,448 4,981 3,512 Deferred provision (benefit) 130 ( 8 ) 230 Total provision for income taxes $ 4,578 $ 4,973 $ 3,742 The reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2019 Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ 4,685 21.0 % $ 4,356 21.0 % $ 3,776 21.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 419 1.9 315 1.5 271 1.5 Share-based awards - excess tax benefit ( 100 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 130 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 132 ) ( 0.7 ) Non-deductible compensation 144 0.6 134 0.7 119 0.7 Health insurance tax — — 626 3.0 — — Foreign rate differential ( 246 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 164 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 214 ) ( 1.2 ) Other, net ( 324 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 164 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 78 ) ( 0.5 ) Provision for income taxes $ 4,578 20.5 % $ 4,973 24.0 % $ 3,742 20.8 % 58 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: (in millions) 2021 2020 Deferred income tax assets: Accrued expenses and allowances $ 723 $ 815 U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 287 276 Share-based compensation 117 98 Nondeductible liabilities 296 252 Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards 435 340 Lease liability 1,284 1,200 Other-domestic 228 126 Other-non-U.S. 376 454 Subtotal 3,746 3,561 Less: valuation allowances ( 198 ) ( 170 ) Total deferred income tax assets 3,548 3,391 Deferred income tax liabilities: U.S. federal and state intangible assets ( 2,658 ) ( 2,588 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets ( 512 ) ( 606 ) Capitalized software ( 833 ) ( 731 ) Depreciation and amortization ( 349 ) ( 346 ) Prepaid expenses ( 256 ) ( 216 ) Outside basis in partnerships ( 565 ) ( 342 ) Lease right-of-use asset ( 1,267 ) ( 1,179 ) Net unrealized gains on investments ( 125 ) ( 400 ) Other-non-U.S. ( 248 ) ( 350 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 6,813 ) ( 6,758 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities $ ( 3,265 ) $ ( 3,367 ) Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 42 million expire beginning in 2023 through 2037 and $ 295 million have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2022 through 2041, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 1,829 $ 1,423 $ 1,056 Gross increases: Current year tax positions 538 416 512 Prior year tax positions 10 120 2 Gross decreases: Prior year tax positions ( 47 ) ( 130 ) ( 96 ) Settlements — — ( 46 ) Statute of limitations lapses ( 20 ) — ( 5 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 2,310 $ 1,829 $ 1,423 59 Table of Contents The Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $ 42 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $ 66 million, $ 52 million and $ 19 million of net interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $ 194 million and $ 128 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2021, there were $ 1.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2014 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Company’s regulated insurance and health maintenance organization (HMO) subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.0 billion, including $ 4.7 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.3 billion, including $ 4.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $ 30.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $ 13.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2021, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.” Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2018, the Board renewed the Company’s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Common share repurchases, shares 13 14 Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 389.92 $ 300.58 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 5,000 $ 4,250 Board authorized shares remaining 45 58 60 Table of Contents Dividends In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2020.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represents the period of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 62 Table of Contents 12. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs were $ 1.2 billion, $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and included immaterial variable and short-term lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $ 921 million, $ 865 million and $ 746 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which were classified within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.7 years and 2.9 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Minimum Lease Payments 2022 $ 870 2023 763 2024 616 2025 510 2026 407 Thereafter 1,716 Total future minimum lease payments 4,882 Less imputed interest ( 609 ) Total $ 4,273 Other Commitments The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $ 181 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $ 1.3 billion, primarily to bond contractual performance. Pending Acquisitions In 2021, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2022, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 12 billion. Legal Matters The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of 63 Table of Contents Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. 13. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s four reportable segments derives its revenues: • UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, sole proprietorships and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community & State provides diversified health care benefits products and services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global provides health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in South America, and other diversified global health businesses. • Optum Health focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. Optum Health is building a comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their health through in-person, in-home, virtual and digital clinical platforms. Optum Health offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. • Optum Insight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations comprising the health care industry depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. • Optum Rx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. Optum Rx integrates 64 Table of Contents pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing. The Company’s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by Optum Rx, certain product offerings and care management and local and in-home care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 36 %, 36 % and 33 % for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 97 %, 97 % and 96 % of consolidated total revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 78 % and 75 % of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global. 65 Table of Contents The following table presents the reportable segment financial information: Optum (in millions) UnitedHealthcare Optum Health Optum Insight Optum Rx Optum Eliminations Optum Corporate and Eliminations Consolidated 2021 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 212,381 $ 13,852 $ — $ — $ — $ 13,852 $ — $ 226,233 Products — 32 159 34,246 — 34,437 — 34,437 Services 9,661 9,894 3,936 1,112 — 14,942 — 24,603 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 222,042 23,778 4,095 35,358 — 63,231 — 285,273 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 29,234 7,867 55,779 ( 2,013 ) 90,867 ( 90,867 ) — Investment and other income 857 1,053 237 177 — 1,467 — 2,324 Total revenues $ 222,899 $ 54,065 $ 12,199 $ 91,314 $ ( 2,013 ) $ 155,565 $ ( 90,867 ) $ 287,597 Earnings from operations $ 11,975 $ 4,462 $ 3,398 $ 4,135 $ — $ 11,995 $ — $ 23,970 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,660 ) ( 1,660 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 11,975 $ 4,462 $ 3,398 $ 4,135 $ — $ 11,995 $ ( 1,660 ) $ 22,310 Total assets $ 102,967 $ 60,474 $ 16,868 $ 40,181 $ — $ 117,523 $ ( 8,284 ) $ 212,206 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 795 791 567 301 — 1,659 — 2,454 Depreciation and amortization 1,004 818 684 597 — 2,099 — 3,103 2020 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 191,679 $ 9,799 $ — $ — $ — $ 9,799 $ — $ 201,478 Products — 33 135 33,977 — 34,145 — 34,145 Services 8,464 6,815 3,687 1,050 — 11,552 — 20,016 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 200,143 16,647 3,822 35,027 — 55,496 — 255,639 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 22,481 6,941 52,420 ( 1,800 ) 80,042 ( 80,042 ) — Investment and other income 732 680 39 51 — 770 — 1,502 Total revenues $ 200,875 $ 39,808 $ 10,802 $ 87,498 $ ( 1,800 ) $ 136,308 $ ( 80,042 ) $ 257,141 Earnings from operations $ 12,359 $ 3,434 $ 2,725 $ 3,887 $ — $ 10,046 $ — $ 22,405 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,663 ) ( 1,663 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 12,359 $ 3,434 $ 2,725 $ 3,887 $ — $ 10,046 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 20,742 Total assets $ 98,229 $ 52,073 $ 15,425 $ 39,280 $ — $ 106,778 $ ( 7,718 ) $ 197,289 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 687 715 461 188 — 1,364 — 2,051 Depreciation and amortization 920 703 670 598 — 1,971 — 2,891 2019 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 183,783 $ 5,916 $ — $ — $ — $ 5,916 $ — $ 189,699 Products — 31 116 31,450 — 31,597 — 31,597 Services 8,922 5,732 3,630 689 — 10,051 — 18,973 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 192,705 11,679 3,746 32,139 — 47,564 — 240,269 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 17,966 6,239 42,093 ( 1,661 ) 64,637 ( 64,637 ) — Investment and other income 1,137 672 21 56 — 749 — 1,886 Total revenues $ 193,842 $ 30,317 $ 10,006 $ 74,288 $ ( 1,661 ) $ 112,950 $ ( 64,637 ) $ 242,155 Earnings from operations $ 10,326 $ 2,963 $ 2,494 $ 3,902 $ — $ 9,359 $ — $ 19,685 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,704 ) ( 1,704 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 10,326 $ 2,963 $ 2,494 $ 3,902 $ — $ 9,359 $ ( 1,704 ) $ 17,981 Total assets $ 88,250 $ 40,444 $ 15,181 $ 36,346 $ — $ 91,971 $ ( 6,332 ) $ 173,889 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 841 573 495 162 — 1,230 — 2,071 Depreciation and amortization 926 565 672 557 — 1,794 — 2,720 66 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2021. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 67 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2021 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. 68 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 15, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2021. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 15, 2022 69 Table of Contents ITEM 9B.

UnitedHealthcare utilizes Optum’s capabilities to help coordinate and provide patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy care services, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler and more satisfying consumer and physician experience. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks which, as of December 31, 2020, include 1.4 million physicians and other health care professionals and more than 6,500 hospitals and other facilities. UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under “Government Regulation” and in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individual consumers. As of December 31, 2020, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides access to medical services for 26.2 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners, including employer customers, serving people across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. Products are offered through affiliates licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs). Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers who elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees’ dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has relationships with network care providers who integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payments and care management programs and enable us to jointly better manage health care and improve quality across populations. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies who contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. In addition, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual distributes its products through professional employer organizations, associations and through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces.

Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s major product categories include: Medicare Advantage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 5.7 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2020. Built on more than 20 years of experience, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. We have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed nearly 1.7 million preventive care visits in 2020 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software and digital therapeutics for remote monitoring enabling clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information bridging across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans to help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people’s needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2020, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.2 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 4.0 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. Medicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is currently serving 4.5 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at a diversity of price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program. Premium revenues from CMS represented 36% of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community & State UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2020, UnitedHealthcare Community & State participated in programs in 31 states and the District of Columbia, and served 6.6 million people; including more than 1.1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 16 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation, including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected 6 Table of Contents program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community & State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community & State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants affecting people’s health status and health system usage. Approximately 75% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only approximately 50% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care, including DSNP and LTSS programs. Our offerings to state expansion cover more medically complex populations, including integrated care management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. UnitedHealthcare Community & State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model enables UnitedHealthcare Community & State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care. UnitedHealthcare Global UnitedHealthcare Global serves 7.6 million people with medical and dental benefits, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, but also in 150 other countries.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies who generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit 7 Table of Contents our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. In addition, our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. Our businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; included contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations, which may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those who maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations which where adopted by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by the state’s regulation. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the ACA, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Our health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain affiliated transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material affiliated transfers of 8 Table of Contents assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations which set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies who oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations which may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws governing the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws prohibiting specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices which involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations OptumRx’s businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies which must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some non-resident states also require us to comply with their laws where pharmaceuticals are delivered. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Federal and state legislation of PBM activities affect both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) requirements to use particular care providers or distribution channel, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. 9 Table of Contents Additionally, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations and credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards impacting PBM pharmacy activities. While these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions which carries out annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services, including organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants and business combinations also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify. 12 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. The ongoing COVID-19 global health crisis continues to have major impacts on health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities. We have mobilized the full strength of our resources to deliver the best care for patients, support for our members and care provider partners, keep our employees safe and deliver innovative solutions and support for the communities we serve and the entire health system. The impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, and the timing for widespread availability and effectiveness of a vaccine, factors which remain uncertain at this time. These factors continue to affect the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. As the crisis abates, we may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. The premiums and fees we charge, including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions, may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers, health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in our customers having to close or severely curtail their operations. Among other impacts, we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments. In addition, governments have modified, and may continue to modify, regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to COVID-19, and these changing standards may create challenges for us to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations. Further disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could adversely disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs. Additionally, the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations, including restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. Although we cannot predict the pacing, intensity and duration of COVID-19, the pandemic’s disruption to business activities, employment and economic effects, and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our OptumHealth business negotiates risk-based arrangements with commercial third-party payers which are also included in premium revenues. Under a typical arrangement, OptumHealth receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, such as COVID-19, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or 13 Table of Contents utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2020 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2020 would have been reduced by approximately $290 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, price adequately our products and services, provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties; incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place which are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, detect breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or 14 Table of Contents confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns, negatively affecting our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information security. In addition, we are subject to heightened vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks associated with increased numbers of employees working from home. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; financial fraud schemes; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events which could negatively affect our systems, our customers’ data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, South America and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular geographies or segments, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors which give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services, which are useful and relevant to consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive, and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage. We may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models could result in competitive disadvantages and loss of market share. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result 15 Table of Contents in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Our health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of some of our businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. While we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record 16 Table of Contents liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions, which further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment has caused lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group benefits and pharmacy services 17 Table of Contents plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum’s financial results. Our failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance. We are dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, to operate and expand our business. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. In addition, we believe our corporate culture fosters integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance. Adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2020. Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. There can be no assurance our investments will produce total positive returns or we will not sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. 18 Table of Contents If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2020, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $82 billion, representing 42% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies who write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 19 Table of Contents Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA are being considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part. A federal appeals court struck down the ACA as in part unconstitutional in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case. Further, the integration into our businesses of entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) which vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Global business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar, while our Banmédica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 20 Table of Contents The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted in, and in the future could result in, adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 21 Table of Contents Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Additionally, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, OptumRx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards impacting the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency who enforces ERISA, could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) overhauled data protection laws in the European Union. The new regulation superseded prior European Union privacy and data protection legislation, imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, took effect in August 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or 22 Table of Contents other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES To support our business operations in the United States and other countries we own and lease real properties. Our various reportable segments use these facilities for their respective business purposes, and we believe these current facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are adequate for our anticipated future needs.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; • OptumRx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. During the second quarter, the global health system experienced unprecedented levels of care deferral, which impacted all of our businesses. As the pandemic advanced, access to and demand for care was most constrained from mid-March through April, began to recover in May and June and restored to near normal seasonal levels in the third quarter. Care patterns continued to normalize in the fourth quarter, returning to, and even exceeding, seasonal baselines, including COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, towards the end of the quarter. The temporary deferral of care experienced in 2020 may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in future periods as utilization of health system capacity continues to increase. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: Optum. The temporary deferral of care impacted the Optum businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020. For example, our fee-for-service care delivery business, such as traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers, was negatively impacted, while our risk-based care delivery business performance reflected lower demand for care. Our OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses were negatively impacted by the lower level of care encounters which took place, as well as by broader economic factors, contributing to lower managed services and prescription volume. As the health system returned to normal seasonally adjusted levels of care, we have seen business activity approach normal levels. COVID-19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of COVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services Optum provides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain. 25 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare. During 2020, we expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy benefits; provided customers assistance in the form of co-pay waivers and premium forgiveness; offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer-sponsored offerings; extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship; simplified administrative practices; and accelerated payments to care providers, all with the aim of assisting our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Temporary care deferrals significantly impacted UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact of temporary care deferrals was offset by COVID-19 related care and testing, the significant financial assistance we provided our customers, rebate requirements and broader economic impacts. Enrollment in our commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions in response to the pandemic. Increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, along with continued COVID-19 care and testing costs are expected to result in increased future medical costs. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, may temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting future revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, and general economic uncertainty. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. The ACA had an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. Pricing for contracts covering some portion of calendar year 2021 reflected the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states who are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 care and testing costs and certain of our customer assistance initiatives have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. The uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying performance-based care provider payment models rewarding high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2020, we served nearly 18 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. 26 Table of Contents This trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2021 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 1.7%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. ACA Tax. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax for 2020, which was primarily borne by customers, was $15.5 billion, with our portion being approximately $3.0 billion. The return of the tax impacted year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. The Health Insurance Industry Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS The following represents a summary of select 2020 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2019. • Consolidated revenues increased by 6%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 4% and Optum revenues grew 21%. • UnitedHealthcare served 420,000 fewer people domestically primarily due to increased unemployment and attrition in commercial group benefits, partially offset by growth in government programs. • Earnings from operations increased by 14%, including increases of 20% at UnitedHealthcare and 7% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share increased 12% to $16.03. • Cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion, an increase of 20%. • Return on equity was 24.9%. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 Revenues: Premiums $ 201,478 $ 189,699 $ 178,087 $ 11,779 6 % Products 34,145 31,597 29,601 2,548 8 Services 20,016 18,973 17,183 1,043 5 Investment and other income 1,502 1,886 1,376 (384) (20) Total revenues 257,141 242,155 226,247 14,986 6 Operating costs: Medical costs 159,396 156,440 145,403 2,956 2 Operating costs 41,704 35,193 34,074 6,511 19 Cost of products sold 30,745 28,117 26,998 2,628 9 Depreciation and amortization 2,891 2,720 2,428 171 6 Total operating costs 234,736 222,470 208,903 12,266 6 Earnings from operations 22,405 19,685 17,344 2,720 14 Interest expense (1,663) (1,704) (1,400) 41 (2) Earnings before income taxes 20,742 17,981 15,944 2,761 15 Provision for income taxes (4,973) (3,742) (3,562) (1,231) 33 Net earnings 15,769 14,239 12,382 1,530 11 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (366) (400) (396) 34 (9) Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 15,403 $ 13,839 $ 11,986 $ 1,564 11 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 16.03 $ 14.33 $ 12.19 $ 1.70 12 % Medical care ratio (a) 79.1 % 82.5 % 81.6 % (3.4) % Operating cost ratio 16.2 14.5 15.1 1.7 Operating margin 8.7 8.1 7.7 0.6 Tax rate 24.0 20.8 22.3 3.2 Net earnings margin (b) 6.0 5.7 5.3 0.3 Return on equity (c) 24.9 % 25.7 % 24.4 % (0.8) % ________ (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

The increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our commercial and Global benefits businesses, certain voluntary customer assistance programs and rebate requirements. Revenues were also negatively impacted by decreases in our fee-for-service care delivery and other volume-based businesses, primarily as a result of the care deferral and economic impacts of COVID-19. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, medical cost trends and COVID-19 care and testing costs, partially offset by decreased people served in commercial and Global, modestly lower care patterns and increased prior year favorable development. The MCR decreased primarily due to the temporary deferral of care and the revenue effects of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, partially offset by COVID-19 care and testing costs, rebate requirements and voluntary customer assistance measures. 28 Table of Contents Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, COVID-19 response efforts and business mix, partially offset by operating efficiency gains. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements ” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 200,875 $ 193,842 $ 183,476 $ 7,033 4 % OptumHealth 39,808 30,317 24,145 9,491 31 OptumInsight 10,802 10,006 9,008 796 8 OptumRx 87,498 74,288 69,536 13,210 18 Optum eliminations (1,800) (1,661) (1,409) (139) 8 Optum 136,308 112,950 101,280 23,358 21 Eliminations (80,042) (64,637) (58,509) (15,405) 24 Consolidated revenues $ 257,141 $ 242,155 $ 226,247 $ 14,986 6 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 12,359 $ 10,326 $ 9,113 $ 2,033 20 % OptumHealth 3,434 2,963 2,430 471 16 OptumInsight 2,725 2,494 2,243 231 9 OptumRx 3,887 3,902 3,558 (15) — Optum 10,046 9,359 8,231 687 7 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 22,405 $ 19,685 $ 17,344 $ 2,720 14 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 6.2 % 5.3 % 5.0 % 0.9 % OptumHealth 8.6 9.8 10.1 (1.2) OptumInsight 25.2 24.9 24.9 0.3 OptumRx 4.4 5.3 5.1 (0.9) Optum 7.4 8.3 8.1 (0.9) Consolidated operating margin 8.7 % 8.1 % 7.7 % 0.6 % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 55,872 $ 56,945 $ 54,761 $ (1,073) (2) % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 90,764 83,252 75,473 7,512 9 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 46,487 43,790 43,426 2,697 6 UnitedHealthcare Global 7,752 9,855 9,816 (2,103) (21) Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 200,875 $ 193,842 $ 183,476 $ 7,033 4 % 29 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: December 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 Commercial: Risk-based 7,910 8,575 8,495 (665) (8) % Fee-based 18,310 19,185 18,420 (875) (5) Total commercial 26,220 27,760 26,915 (1,540) (6) Medicare Advantage 5,710 5,270 4,945 440 8 Medicaid 6,620 5,900 6,450 720 12 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,460 4,500 4,545 (40) (1) Total public and senior 16,790 15,670 15,940 1,120 7 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 43,010 43,430 42,855 (420) (1) Global 5,425 5,720 6,220 (295) (5) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 48,435 49,150 49,075 (715) (1) % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 4,045 4,405 4,710 (360) (8) % Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans. The decrease in people served by UnitedHealthcare Global is a result of increased unemployment and underwriting discipline. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial and Global businesses and foreign currency impacts. In 2020, earnings from operations increased due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19 on the health system and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, COVID-19 care and testing costs, customer assistance programs and broader economic effects. Optum Total revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth. Earnings from operations increased due to growth at OptumHealth and OptumInsight. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery. Reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements as a result of COVID-19 partially offset the increases in revenues and earnings. OptumHealth served approximately 98 million people as of December 31, 2020 compared to 96 million people as of December 31, 2019. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in technology and managed services, partially offset by decreased activity levels in volume-based services due to the impact of COVID-19 on payer and care provider clients. OptumRx Revenue at OptumRx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy co-payments. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements "" for further detail. Revenue at OptumRx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in pharmacy care services, including specialty pharmacy, and new client wins, partially offset by an expected large client transition and lower script volumes driven by COVID-19 related care deferral and fewer people served due to economic-driven employment attrition. Earnings from operations remained relatively flat as COVID-19 impacts were partially offset by the factors impacting revenue and improved 30 Table of Contents supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in both 2020 and 2019 with growth offset by the large client transition. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimal levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdiction, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies. Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.3 billion and $5.6 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements ” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 22,174 $ 18,463 $ 15,713 $ 3,711 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments 2,586 3,994 4,134 (1,408) Proceeds from common share issuances 1,440 1,037 838 403 Customer funds administered 1,677 13 — 1,664 Other — 219 — (219) Total sources of cash 27,877 23,726 20,685 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (7,139) (8,343) (5,997) 1,204 Cash dividends paid (4,584) (3,932) (3,320) (652) Common share repurchases (4,250) (5,500) (4,500) 1,250 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,051) (2,071) (2,063) 20 Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,836) (2,504) (4,099) (332) Other (965) (1,237) (1,743) 272 Total uses of cash (21,825) (23,587) (21,722) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (116) (20) (78) (96) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 5,936 $ 119 $ (1,115) $ 5,817 2020 Cash Flows Compared to 2019 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings as well as changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in customer funds administered and net purchases of investments, and decreases in net issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, cash paid for acquisitions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents Financial Condition As of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $59.0 billion included $16.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.3 billion was available for general corporate use), $39.8 billion of debt securities and $2.3 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements ” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.7 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2020. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity Cash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, commercial paper and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: • Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II , I tem 8 , “ Financial Statements ” for further detail of our commercial paper and long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually. • Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements ” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. • Purchase and other obligations. These include $5.3 billion, $2.0 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020. • Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments. • Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements ” for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months. We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statement s . ” Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2020, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements .” 32 Table of Contents Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2020 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 58 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements .” Dividends. In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements .” Pending Acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, which are expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2021, we entered into agreements to purchase multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG). This acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to Change Healthcare shareholders’ approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $13 billion. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of t he Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements ” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements which affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2020, our days outstanding in medical payables was 48 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2020, 2019 and 2018 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $880 million, $580 million and $320 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying 33 Table of Contents observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. Our judgments also consider the impacts of COVID-19 on these factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2020: Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 600 (0.50) 399 (0.25) 199 0.25 (198) 0.50 (395) 0.75 (591) Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, which included consideration of COVID-19 in 2020. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2020: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 793 2 529 1 264 (1) (264) (2) (529) (3) (793) The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2020; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2020 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2020 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $157 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements .” 34 Table of Contents Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates, cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact. The market-based method requires determination of appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market. The peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value. As of October 1, 2020, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements . ” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. As of December 31, 2020, we had $20 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2020, $8 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, $37 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $45 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. 35 Table of Contents We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2020 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 401 $ 163 $ (3,020) $ (8,700) 1 201 82 (1,499) (4,744) (1) (75) (12) 820 5,266 (2) (75) (12) 886 8,101 December 31, 2019 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 282 $ 185 $ (2,668) $ (6,813) 1 141 93 (1,331) (3,704) (1) (141) (93) 1,246 4,433 (2) (282) (185) 2,071 9,613 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $535 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2020, we had $ 2.3 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

Segment Financial Information 65 37 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description Medical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels, and processing cycles. We identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors. • We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. 38 Table of Contents • With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: – Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. – Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate. – Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2020 with dates of service in 2019 or prior. Goodwill - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description At December 31, 2020, the Company’s goodwill balance was $71 billion. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date, therefore no impairment was recognized. We identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the valuation, business, and market assumptions including the discount rate, financial forecasts, and peer group used by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units where a quantitative analysis was performed, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management’s financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates, company specific risks, peer companies, and market multiples. • We evaluated management’s ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing: – Actual results to historical forecasts. – Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers. • We evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from the October 1, 2020 annual measurement date to December 31, 2020. • We evaluated management’s selection of peer companies and market multiples. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodologies, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, (2) the weighting of such valuation methodologies, and (3) discount rate and company specific risks by: – Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. – Developing a range of independent discount rate estimates and comparing to those selected by management. / S / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota March 1, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. 39 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Consolidated

Description of Business UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain risk-based arrangements at its OptumHealth care delivery businesses. The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Products and Services For the Company’s OptumRx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed 45 Table of Contents through the Company’s home delivery, specialty and community pharmacies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its OptumRx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member’s applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Revenues are also comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. OptumHealth’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumInsight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. OptumInsight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accounts receivables related to products and services were $ 5.3 billion and $ 4.3 billion, respectively. In 2020 and 2019, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material. See Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2020. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90 % of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19 in 2020. 46 Table of Contents In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. Pursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 47 Table of Contents Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $ 6.3 billion and $ 4.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s Medicare Part D receivables amounted to $ 2.9 billion and $ 2.3 billion, respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Operating Leases The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, discount rates and the selection of comparable peer companies. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2020. Intangible Assets The Company’s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. 48 Table of Contents Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($ 10.2 billion and $ 8.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively), the RSF associated with the AARP Program, accruals for premium rebates payable, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: (in millions) 2020 2019 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period $ 1,726 $ 1,908 Net earnings 112 115 Acquisitions 321 90 Redemptions — ( 618 ) Distributions ( 149 ) ( 69 ) Fair value and other adjustments 201 300 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period $ 2,211 $ 1,726 Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. ACA Tax The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax for 2020, which was primarily borne by the customer, was $15.5 billion, of which the Company’s portion was approximately $ 3.0 billion. The Health Insurance Industry Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. 49 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires the use of the current expected credit loss impairment model to develop an estimate of expected credit losses for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses and revises certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, equity and cash flows. The Company has determined there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards which had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The Company held $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.0 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the 50 Table of Contents health care sector, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2020 was not material. The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 2,951 $ 2,966 $ 348 $ 349 Due after one year through five years 11,638 12,088 241 245 Due after five years through ten years 10,212 10,931 27 29 Due after ten years 4,313 4,545 22 24 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,849 7,091 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,116 2,207 — — Total debt securities $ 38,079 $ 39,828 $ 638 $ 647 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses December 31, 2020 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 346 $ ( 3 ) $ — $ — $ 346 $ ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,273 ( 9 ) 456 ( 3 ) 1,729 ( 12 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 601 ( 3 ) — — 601 ( 3 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 195 ( 1 ) 93 ( 3 ) 288 ( 4 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,415 $ ( 16 ) $ 549 $ ( 6 ) $ 2,964 $ ( 22 ) December 31, 2019 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 616 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 616 $ ( 4 ) State and municipal obligations 440 ( 5 ) — — 440 ( 5 ) Corporate obligations 1,903 ( 7 ) 740 ( 4 ) 2,643 ( 11 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 657 ( 3 ) 333 ( 3 ) 990 ( 6 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 406 ( 3 ) — — 406 ( 3 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 4,022 $ ( 22 ) $ 1,073 $ ( 7 ) $ 5,095 $ ( 29 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2020 were generated from approximately 2,000 positions out of a total of 36,000 positions. The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, and the potential economic impacts of COVID-19 on the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2020 was not material. 4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to 51 Table of Contents the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: • Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); • Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and • Inputs corroborated by other observable market data. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding. Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt and equity securities. 52 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt securities. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,841 $ 80 $ — $ 16,921 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,241 224 — 3,465 State and municipal obligations — 7,328 — 7,328 Corporate obligations 25 19,424 288 19,737 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,091 — 7,091 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,207 — 2,207 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,266 36,274 288 39,828 Equity securities 1,795 33 — 1,828 Assets under management 1,774 2,250 52 4,076 Total assets at fair value $ 23,676 $ 38,637 $ 340 $ 62,653 Percentage of total assets at fair value 38 % 61 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,837 $ 148 $ — $ 10,985 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,369 184 — 3,553 State and municipal obligations — 5,926 — 5,926 Corporate obligations 70 17,923 249 18,242 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,528 — 6,528 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,845 — 1,845 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,439 32,406 249 36,094 Equity securities 1,734 22 — 1,756 Assets under management 1,123 1,918 35 3,076 Total assets at fair value $ 17,133 $ 34,494 $ 284 $ 51,911 Percentage of total assets at fair value 33 % 66 % 1 % 100 % The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value December 31, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 466 $ 108 $ 73 $ 647 $ 638 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 51,254 $ — $ 51,254 $ 42,171 December 31, 2019 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 541 $ 181 $ 253 $ 975 $ 972 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 45,078 $ — $ 45,078 $ 40,278 The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the table above. 53 Table of Contents 5.

The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 100 million expire beginning in 2023 through 2037 and $ 309 million have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2021 through 2040, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. 59 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 1,423 $ 1,056 $ 598 Gross increases: Current year tax positions 416 512 487 Prior year tax positions 120 2 87 Gross decreases: Prior year tax positions ( 130 ) ( 96 ) ( 84 ) Settlements — ( 46 ) ( 20 ) Statute of limitations lapses — ( 5 ) ( 12 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 1,829 $ 1,423 $ 1,056 The Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $ 39 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $ 52 million, $ 19 million and $ 6 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $ 128 million and $ 76 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2020, there were $ 1.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2013 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Company’s regulated insurance and health maintenance organization (HMO) subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.3 billion, including $ 4.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 5.6 billion, including $ 1.3 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $ 29.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $ 11.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2020, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.” 60 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2018, the Board renewed the Company’s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Common share repurchases, shares 14 22 Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 300.58 $ 245.97 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 4,250 $ 5,500 Board authorized shares remaining 58 72 Dividends In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2020 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 24 $ 1.08 $ 1,024 June 30 1.25 1,188 September 22 1.25 1,188 December 15 1.25 1,184 11. Share-Based Compensation The Company’s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved 48 million additional shares under the Plan. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 71 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represents the period of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2020, 2019 and 2018. 62 Table of Contents In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 12. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs were $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.0 billion and $ 751 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and included immaterial variable and short-term lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $ 865 million and $ 746 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which were classified within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.7 years and 3.0 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Minimum Lease Payments 2021 $ 865 2022 775 2023 646 2024 538 2025 441 Thereafter 1,781 Total future minimum lease payments 5,046 Less imputed interest ( 599 ) Total $ 4,447 Other Commitments The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $ 134 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $ 1.2 billion, primarily to bond contractual performance. Pending Acquisitions In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, which are expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2021, the Company entered into agreements to purchase multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG). This acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to Change Healthcare shareholders’ approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 13 billion. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to 63 Table of Contents estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. 13. Business Combinations During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed several business combinations for total cash consideration of $ 7.9 billion. The total consideration exceeded the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $ 8.1 billion, of which $ 1.7 billion has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $ 6.4 billion to goodwill. The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Acquired tangible assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 715 Accounts receivable and other current assets 735 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 816 Medical costs payable ( 316 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 861 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 817 ) Total net tangible assets $ 272 The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent and tax liabilities, are finalized. See Note 6 for a summary of the acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to acquired finite-lived intangible assets. The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, acquired entities impact on revenue and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2019 were immaterial for both periods. The pro forma effects of the acquisitions on net earnings were immaterial for both years. 64 Table of Contents 14. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s four reportable segments derives its revenues: • UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community & State provides diversified health care benefits products and services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged and the medically underserved. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global provides health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in South America, and other diversified global health businesses. • OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. OptumHealth is building a comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their health through in-person, virtual and digital clinical platforms. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. • OptumInsight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations comprising the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. • OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. OptumRx integrates pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing. The Company’s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 36 %, 33 % and 30 % for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 97 %, 96 % and 96 % of consolidated total revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 75 % and 72 % of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global. 65 Table of Contents The following table presents the reportable segment financial information: Optum (in millions) UnitedHealthcare OptumHealth OptumInsight OptumRx Optum Eliminations Optum Corporate and Eliminations Consolidated 2020 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 191,679 $ 9,799 $ — $ — $ — $ 9,799 $ — $ 201,478 Products — 33 135 33,977 — 34,145 — 34,145 Services 8,464 6,815 3,687 1,050 — 11,552 — 20,016 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 200,143 16,647 3,822 35,027 — 55,496 — 255,639 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 22,481 6,941 52,420 ( 1,800 ) 80,042 ( 80,042 ) — Investment and other income 732 680 39 51 — 770 — 1,502 Total revenues $ 200,875 $ 39,808 $ 10,802 $ 87,498 $ ( 1,800 ) $ 136,308 $ ( 80,042 ) $ 257,141 Earnings from operations $ 12,359 $ 3,434 $ 2,725 $ 3,887 $ — $ 10,046 $ — $ 22,405 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,663 ) ( 1,663 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 12,359 $ 3,434 $ 2,725 $ 3,887 $ — $ 10,046 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 20,742 Total assets $ 98,229 $ 52,073 $ 15,425 $ 39,280 $ — $ 106,778 $ ( 7,718 ) $ 197,289 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 687 715 461 188 — 1,364 — 2,051 Depreciation and amortization 920 703 670 598 — 1,971 — 2,891 2019 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 183,783 $ 5,916 $ — $ — $ — $ 5,916 $ — $ 189,699 Products — 31 116 31,450 — 31,597 — 31,597 Services 8,922 5,732 3,630 689 — 10,051 — 18,973 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 192,705 11,679 3,746 32,139 — 47,564 — 240,269 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 17,966 6,239 42,093 ( 1,661 ) 64,637 ( 64,637 ) — Investment and other income 1,137 672 21 56 — 749 — 1,886 Total revenues $ 193,842 $ 30,317 $ 10,006 $ 74,288 $ ( 1,661 ) $ 112,950 $ ( 64,637 ) $ 242,155 Earnings from operations $ 10,326 $ 2,963 $ 2,494 $ 3,902 $ — $ 9,359 $ — $ 19,685 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,704 ) ( 1,704 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 10,326 $ 2,963 $ 2,494 $ 3,902 $ — $ 9,359 $ ( 1,704 ) $ 17,981 Total assets $ 88,250 $ 40,444 $ 15,181 $ 36,346 $ — $ 91,971 $ ( 6,332 ) $ 173,889 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 841 573 495 162 — 1,230 — 2,071 Depreciation and amortization 926 565 672 557 — 1,794 — 2,720 2018 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 174,282 $ 3,805 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,805 $ — $ 178,087 Products — 52 111 29,438 — 29,601 — 29,601 Services 8,366 4,925 3,280 612 — 8,817 — 17,183 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 182,648 8,782 3,391 30,050 — 42,223 — 224,871 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 14,882 5,596 39,440 ( 1,409 ) 58,509 ( 58,509 ) — Investment and other income 828 481 21 46 — 548 — 1,376 Total revenues $ 183,476 $ 24,145 $ 9,008 $ 69,536 $ ( 1,409 ) $ 101,280 $ ( 58,509 ) $ 226,247 Earnings from operations $ 9,113 $ 2,430 $ 2,243 $ 3,558 $ — $ 8,231 $ — $ 17,344 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,400 ) ( 1,400 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 9,113 $ 2,430 $ 2,243 $ 3,558 $ — $ 8,231 $ ( 1,400 ) $ 15,944 Total assets $ 82,938 $ 29,837 $ 11,039 $ 33,912 $ — $ 74,788 $ ( 5,505 ) $ 152,221 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 761 593 517 192 — 1,302 — 2,063 Depreciation and amortization 845 439 654 490 — 1,583 — 2,428 66 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2020. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 67 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2020 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. 68 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2020. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota March 1, 2021 69 Table of Contents ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “its,” “UnitedHealth Group,” or the “Company” used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information, advanced technology, and clinical expertise, focused on improving health outcomes, lowering health care costs and creating a better experience for patients, their caregivers and physicians. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community & State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global provides health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in South America, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance, leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, health care delivery and health care operations. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2019, we processed nearly a trillion dollars in gross billed charges and we managed more than $250 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology, consulting and managed outsourced services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health care industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global; • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; and • OptumRx. UnitedHealthcare Through its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, helping to control rising health care costs and creating a better health care experience for its customers. UnitedHealthcare’s market position is built on: • strong local-market relationships; • the breadth of product offerings, based upon extensive expertise in distinct market segments in health care; • service and advanced technology, including digital consumer engagement; • competitive medical and operating cost positions; • effective clinical engagement; and • innovation for customers and consumers. UnitedHealthcare utilizes Optum’s capabilities to help coordinate and provide patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy benefits, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler and more satisfying consumer experienc e. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1.4 million physicians and other health care professionals and more than 6,500 hospitals and other facilities. 1 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under “Government Regulation” and in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides access to medical services for 27.8 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners, including employer customers, serving people across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. Products are offered through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs). Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees’ dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals served by UnitedHealth Group makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has relationships with network care providers that integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payments and care management programs and enable us to jointly better manage health care and improve quality across populations. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. In addition, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual distributes its products through professional employer organizations, associations and through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s diverse product portfolio offers employers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provides the flexibility to meet a full spectrum of their coverage needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s major product families include: Traditional Products. Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options, and offer a spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. Consumer Engagement Products. Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals’ responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs, consumer education and other digital offerings. We also offer and have been developing a variety of innovative consumer-centric products that align to the unique needs and financial means of our customers, while engaging individuals in better managing their health. Clinical and Pharmacy Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy care services products, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging consumers and providing cost-saving options. Consumers served by UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual can access clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, which contribute to improved health and lowered medical expenses. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s comprehensive and integrated pharmacy care services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer improved value and outcomes, helping consumers take actions to improve their health and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs. 2 Table of Contents Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on offering type (risk-based or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts or individual consumers) and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s clinical programs include: • wellness programs; • decision support; • utilization management; • case and disease management; • complex condition management; • on-site programs, including biometrics and flu shots; • incentives to reinforce positive behavior change; • mental health/substance use disorder management; and • employee assistance programs. Specialty Offerings . Through its broad network, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual delivers dental, vision, hearing, life, transportation, critical illness, specified disease/sickness, accident and short-term disability product offerings using an integrated approach in private and retail settings. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services, as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues common among older people. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has distinct pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a selection of products that allow people choice in obtaining the health coverage and services they need as their circumstances change. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is positioned to serve seniors who find that affordable, network-based care provided through Medicare Advantage plans meets their unique health care needs. For those who prefer traditional fee-for-service Medicare, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers both Medicare Supplement and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) programs that supplement their government-sponsored Medicare by providing additional benefits and coverage options. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement services include care management and health system navigator services, clinical management programs, nurse health line services, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients, including AARP, the nation’s largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s major product categories include: Medicare Advantage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 5.3 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2019. Built on more than 20 years of experience, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. Through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed 1.7 million in-home preventive care visits in 2019 to address unmet care 3 Table of Contents opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software and digital therapeutics for remote monitoring that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people’s needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2019, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.0 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 4.4 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. Medicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is currently serving 4.8 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at a diversity of price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program. Premium revenues from CMS represented 33% of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community & State UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), Dual SNPs (DSNPs), Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS), Aged, Blind and Disabled and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2019, UnitedHealthcare Community & State participated in programs in 31 states and the District of Columbia, and served 5.9 million people; including nearly 1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 15 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation, including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community & State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community & State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants that can affect people’s health status and health system usage. Approximately 75% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only 50% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care, including DSNP and LTSS programs. This expansion includes integrated care management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. 4 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare Community & State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model enables UnitedHealthcare Community & State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care; typically, the 5% who are most at risk drive over 50% of states’ medical costs. UnitedHealthcare Global UnitedHealthcare Global serves nearly 8 million people with medical and dental benefits, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, but also in more than 140 other countries. UnitedHealthcare Global serves multinational and local businesses, governments, insurers and individuals and their families through health insurance plans for local populations, care delivery services, benefit plans and risk and assistance solutions. UnitedHealthcare Global offers health care delivery in these markets through more than 300 hospitals, outpatient and ambulatory clinics and surgery centers to UnitedHealthcare Global members and consumers served by the external payer market.

Optum Optum is a technology-enabled health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including: • Those who need care: the consumers who need the right support, information, resources and products to achieve their health goals. • Those who provide care: pharmacies, hospitals, physicians, practices and other health care facilities seeking to modernize the health system and support the best possible patient care and experiences. • Those who pay for care: employers, health plans, and state, federal and municipal agencies devoted to ensuring the populations they sponsor receive high-quality care, administered and delivered efficiently and effectively. • Those who innovate for care: global life sciences organizations dedicated to developing more effective approaches to care, enabling technologies and medicines that improve care delivery and health outcomes. Optum operates three business segments leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, health care delivery and health care operations: • OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services; • OptumInsight offers data, analytics, research, consulting, technology and managed services solutions; and • OptumRx provides a diversified array of pharmacy care services. OptumHealth OptumHealth is a diversified health and wellness business serving the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of 96 million unique individuals. OptumHealth enables population health through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth products and services deliver value by improving quality and patient satisfaction while lowering cost. OptumHealth builds high-performing networks and centers of excellence across the care continuum, by working directly with physicians to advance population health and by coordinating care for the most medically complex patients. OptumHealth serves patients and care providers through its local ambulatory care services business and delivers care through a physician-led, patient-centric and data-driven organization comprised of nearly 50,000 employed, managed or contracted physicians, helping improve care quality, affordability and patient experience. OptumHealth also enables care providers’ transition from traditional, fee-for-service care delivery to performance-based delivery and payment models that improve the focus on patient health and outcomes, such as those emerging through accountable care organizations (ACOs) and local care provider partnerships. Through strategic partnerships, alliances and ownership arrangements, OptumHealth helps care providers adopt new approaches and technologies that improve the coordination of care across all providers involved in patient care to more comprehensively serve patients. Surgical Care Affiliates’ independent ambulatory surgical centers and surgical hospitals provide high-value surgical services at a substantially lower cost than a traditional in-patient hospital setting and MedExpress’ neighborhood care centers provide urgent and walk-in care services with a consumer-friendly approach. OptumServe provides a wide range of health services specifically tailored to active military and veterans and the agencies that support them. OptumHealth serves people through population health services that meet both the preventive care and health intervention needs of consumers across the care continuum, encompassing physical health and wellness, mental health, complex medical 5 Table of Contents conditions, disease management, hospitalization and post-acute care. This includes offering access to proprietary networks of provider specialists, including behavioral health, organ transplant, chiropractic and physical therapy. OptumHealth engages consumers in managing their health through guidance, digital tools and programs that help them achieve their health goals and maintain healthy lifestyles. Optum Financial Services, through Optum Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary, serves consumers through 5.6 million health savings and other accounts and has nearly $12 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2019. During 2019, Optum Bank processed $170 billion in digital medical payments to physicians and other health care providers. Organizations across the health system rely on Optum to manage and improve payment flows through its highly automated, scalable, digital payment systems. OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served, or on a fee-for-service basis, where it delivers medical services to patients in exchange for a contracted fee. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). OptumInsight OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. OptumInsight’s capabilities are focused on technology, research and consulting and managed services that help improve the quality of care and drive greater efficiency in the health care system. Technology includes population health and risk analytics, administrative and clinical technology for claims editing, risk adjustment and payment integrity, health information and electronic data exchange and technology strategy and management. Research and consulting helps organizations reduce administrative costs and implement best practices to improve clinical performance. Managed services provides solutions such as revenue cycle management, risk analytics, payment integrity outsourcing and state Medicaid data and technology management. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, advance quality, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. Many of OptumInsight’s software and information products and professional services are delivered over extended periods, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience with OptumInsight’s customers. OptumInsight’s aggregate backlog as of December 31, 2019 was $19.3 billion, of which $9.9 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. The aggregate backlog includes $7.1 billion related to affiliated agreements. OptumInsight’s aggregate backlog as of December 31, 2018, was $17.0 billion. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements. OptumInsight’s products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsight’s products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsight’s products with their applications. OptumInsight believes it is well positioned to address the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physicians and hospital systems), health plans, governments and life sciences companies. Care Providers. Serving nine out of ten U.S. hospitals and more than 100,000 physicians, OptumInsight assists care providers in meeting their challenge to improve patient outcomes and care amid changing payment models and pressures. OptumInsight brings a broad array of solutions to help care providers meet these challenges, with particular focus on clinical performance and quality improvement, population health, data management and analytics, revenue management, cost containment, compliance, cloud-enabled collaboration and consumer engagement. Health Plans. OptumInsight serves four out of five U.S. health plans through cost-effective, technology-enabled solutions that help them improve efficiency, understand and optimize growth while managing risk, improve payment integrity performance, deliver on clinical initiatives and compliance goals, and build and manage strong networks of care. 6 Table of Contents Governments. OptumInsight provides services tailored to government payers, including data and analytics technology, claims management and payment accuracy services, and strategic consulting. Life Sciences. OptumInsight provides services to global life sciences companies. These companies look to OptumInsight for data, analytics and expertise in core areas of health economics and outcomes research, market access consulting, integrated clinical and health care claims data and informatics services, epidemiology and drug safety, and patient reported outcomes. OptumRx OptumRx provides a full spectrum of pharmacy care services to 56 million people in the United States through its network of more than 67,000 retail pharmacies, multiple home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies and through the provision of infusion services. OptumRx manages limited and ultra-limited distribution drugs in oncology, HIV, pain management and ophthalmology and serves the growing pharmacy needs of people with behavioral health and substance use disorders, particularly Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.

OptumRx provides pharmacy care services to a number of health plans, including a substantial majority of UnitedHealthcare members, large national employer plans, unions and trusts, purchasing coalitions and government entities. OptumRx’s distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales. OptumRx offers multiple clinical programs, digital tools and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner, which are designed to promote better health outcomes, and to help target inappropriate utilization and non-adherence to medication, each of which may result in adverse medical events that affect member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. OptumRx provides various utilization management, medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design and clinical strategies. OptumRx offers a distinctive approach to integrating the management of medical and pharmaceutical care by using data and advanced analytics to help improve comprehensive decision-making, elevate quality, close gaps in care and reduce costs for customers and people served.

OptumRx also operates more than 500 community mental health facility pharmacies, which help align benefits, care management and pharmacy services for those living with complex, chronic medical and behavioral health issues. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. 7 Table of Contents CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. In addition, our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; included contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where adopted by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that state’s regulation. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the ACA, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital 8 Table of Contents structure, ownership, financial condition, certain affiliated transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material affiliated transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices that involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations OptumRx’s businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies that participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Federal and state legislation of PBM activities affect both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such 9 Table of Contents prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) requirements to use particular care providers or distribution channel, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. Additionally, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations and credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards that impact PBM pharmacy activities. While these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services, including organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants and business combinations also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve, which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition. 10 Table of Contents INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS We have obtained trademark registration for the UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare and Optum names and logos.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our OptumHealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers, which are also included in premium revenues. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs 12 Table of Contents provided to the capitated member. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2019 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2019 would have been reduced by approximately $320 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk that they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. For example, some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA are being considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified or repealed or replaced. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part; and a federal appeals court struck down the ACA as in part unconstitutional in 2019. That case has been remanded to federal district court. Further, the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our 13 Table of Contents businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Global business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar, while the Banmédica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations that could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid 14 Table of Contents managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, price adequately our products and services, provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience 15 Table of Contents problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties; incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns that could negatively affect our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events that could negatively affect our systems, our customers’ data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, 16 Table of Contents regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) overhauled data protection laws in the European Union. The new regulation superseded prior European Union privacy and data protection legislation, imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, goes into effect in 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Additionally, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, OptumRx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. 17 Table of Contents If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, South America and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other health care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful and relevant to consumers, we may not remain competitive, and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage, and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Our health care benefits businesses have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. 18 Table of Contents In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of some of our businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. While we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and 19 Table of Contents technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products. If we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions, such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum’s financial results. 20 Table of Contents Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2019 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2019 , our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $76 billion , representing 44% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to 21 Table of Contents policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES To support our business operations in the United States and other countries we own and lease real properties. Our various reportable segments use these facilities for their respective business purposes, and we believe these current facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are adequate for our anticipated future needs.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES MARKET AND HOLDERS Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol UNH. On January 31, 2020, there were 11,517 registered holders of record of our common stock. DIVIDEND POLICY In June 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash divided to shareholders to an annual rate of $4.32 compared to $3.60 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2018. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $256.55 per share. As of December 31, 2019, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 72 million shares of our common stock. 22 Table of Contents PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following performance graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 index, the S&P Health Care Index and the Dow Jones US Industrial Average Index for the five-year period ended December 31, 2019 .

Through our diversified businesses, we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global; • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; and • OptumRx. Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. The ACA, which includes three distinct taxes (ACA Tax), has an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 reflect the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The ACA Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. 25 Table of Contents We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2019, we served over 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2019, our contracts with value-based elements totaled $79 billion in annual spending, including $20 billion through risk-transfer agreements. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2020 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 2.5%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend. This combined with the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. ACA Tax. A provision in the 2019 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. In 2020, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which is primarily borne by customers, will be $15.5 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately $3.0 billion. The ACA Tax was repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS The following represents a summary of select 2019 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2018 . • Consolidated revenues increased by 7% , UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 6% and Optum revenues grew 12% . • UnitedHealthcare served 575,000 additional people domestically as a result of growth in commercial business and services to seniors, partially offset by the proactive withdrawal from the Iowa medicaid market. • Earnings from operations increased by 13% , including increases of 13% at UnitedHealthcare and 14% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share increased 18% to $14.33 . • Cash flows from operations were $18.5 billion , an increase of 18% . 26 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Revenues: Premiums $ 189,699 $ 178,087 $ 158,453 $ 11,612 7 % Products 31,597 29,601 26,366 1,996 7 Services 18,973 17,183 15,317 1,790 10 Investment and other income 1,886 1,376 1,023 510 37 Total revenues 242,155 226,247 201,159 15,908 7 Operating costs: Medical costs 156,440 145,403 130,036 11,037 8 Operating costs 35,193 34,074 29,557 1,119 3 Cost of products sold 28,117 26,998 24,112 1,119 4 Depreciation and amortization 2,720 2,428 2,245 292 12 Total operating costs 222,470 208,903 185,950 13,567 6 Earnings from operations 19,685 17,344 15,209 2,341 13 Interest expense (1,704 ) (1,400 ) (1,186 ) (304 ) 22 Earnings before income taxes 17,981 15,944 14,023 2,037 13 Provision for income taxes (3,742 ) (3,562 ) (3,200 ) (180 ) 5 Net earnings 14,239 12,382 10,823 1,857 15 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (400 ) (396 ) (265 ) (4 ) 1 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 13,839 $ 11,986 $ 10,558 $ 1,853 15 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 14.33 $ 12.19 $ 10.72 $ 2.14 18 % Medical care ratio (a) 82.5 % 81.6 % 82.1 % 0.9 % Operating cost ratio 14.5 15.1 14.7 (0.6 ) Operating margin 8.1 7.7 7.6 0.4 Tax rate 20.8 22.3 22.8 (1.5 ) Net earnings margin (b) 5.7 5.3 5.2 0.4 Return on equity (c) 25.7 % 24.4 % 24.4 % 1.3 % (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and medical cost trends, partially offset by increased prior year favorable medical development. The MCR increased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. 27 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information on our segments.

Medicare Advantage increased due to the growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by the proactive withdrawal from the Iowa market as well as by states adding new carriers to existing programs and managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans. The decrease in people served internationally is a result of our continued affordability efforts and underwriting discipline. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Commercial and Medicare Advantage, including a greater mix of people with a higher acuity needs. Revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. Earnings from operations were also favorably impacted by operating cost management. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity and overall cost management initiatives. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery, increased care services and organic growth in behavioral health services. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to care delivery. OptumHealth served approximately 96 million and 93 million people as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic and acquisition growth in managed services. OptumRx Revenue at OptumRx increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by an expected large client transition. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to the factors that increased revenue as well as improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 1,340 million and 1,343 million adjusted scripts in 2019 and 2018, respectively, with 2019 impacted by the large client transition. 29 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimal levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdiction, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies. Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $5.6 billion and $3.7 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 18,463 $ 15,713 $ 13,596 $ 2,750 Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 3,994 4,134 — (140 ) Proceeds from common share issuances 1,037 838 688 199 Customer funds administered 13 — 3,172 13 Other 219 — — 219 Total sources of cash 23,726 20,685 17,456 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (8,343 ) (5,997 ) (2,131 ) (2,346 ) Cash dividends paid (3,932 ) (3,320 ) (2,773 ) (612 ) Common share repurchases (5,500 ) (4,500 ) (1,500 ) (1,000 ) Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of issuances — — (2,615 ) — Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,071 ) (2,063 ) (2,023 ) (8 ) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,504 ) (4,099 ) (4,319 ) 1,595 Other (1,237 ) (1,743 ) (539 ) 506 Total uses of cash (23,587 ) (21,722 ) (15,900 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (20 ) (78 ) (5 ) 58 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 119 $ (1,115 ) $ 1,551 $ 1,234 30 Table of Contents 2019 Cash Flows Compared to 2018 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings as well as changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in cash paid for acquisitions, increased share repurchases and decreased net purchases of investments. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2019 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $49.1 billion included $11.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $584 million was available for general corporate use), $36.1 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2019 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2019, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 39%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2019 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2019 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 72 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Dividends. In June 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $4.32 compared to $3.60 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 31 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2019, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2020 2021 to 2022 2023 to 2024 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 5,532 $ 9,118 $ 6,122 $ 44,302 $ 65,074 Operating leases 804 1,327 901 1,671 4,703 Purchase and other obligations (b) 1,617 2,483 768 248 5,116 Other liabilities (c) 914 344 285 7,767 9,310 Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d) 852 542 — 332 1,726 Total contractual obligations $ 9,719 $ 13,814 $ 8,076 $ 54,320 $ 85,929 (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more detail. (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 . (c) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements, unrecognized tax benefits and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.” (d) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as “Thereafter.” We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2019, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2019 , our days outstanding in medical payables was 51 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current 32 Table of Contents period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2019, 2018 and 2017 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $580 million , $320 million and $690 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2019 : Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 584 (0.50) 388 (0.25) 194 0.25 (193 ) 0.50 (384 ) 0.75 (575 ) Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2019 : Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 754 2 502 1 251 (1) (251 ) (2) (502 ) (3) (754 ) The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2019 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2019 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs 33 Table of Contents payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2019 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $160 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: • Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. • Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview- Business Trends and the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. • Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. • Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. As of October 1, 2019, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. 34 Table of Contents Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2019 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. As of December 31, 2019 , we had $14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2019 , $9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2019 , $33 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $39 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2019 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets (a) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 282 $ 185 $ (2,668 ) $ (6,813 ) 1 141 93 (1,331 ) (3,704 ) (1) (141 ) (93 ) 1,246 4,433 (2) (282 ) (185 ) 2,071 9,613 December 31, 2018 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets (a) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 276 $ 189 $ (2,242 ) $ (5,017 ) 1 138 94 (1,140 ) (2,724 ) (1) (138 ) (94 ) 1,118 3,155 (2) (276 ) (189 ) 2,196 6,953 (a) As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $600 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) 67 36 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description Medical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. We identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. 37 Table of Contents How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments of time from date of service to claim receipt, and the impact of claim levels and processing cycles. • We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. • With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: ◦ Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. ◦ Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate. ◦ Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year assumptions of the estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2019 with dates of service in 2018 or prior. Goodwill - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description At December 31, 2019, the Company’s goodwill balance was $66 billion. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment for certain of the Company’s reporting units, at least annually, by comparing the carrying values of the reporting units to the estimated fair values as of the impairment testing date. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows, which include financial projections including significant assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. The fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date, therefore no impairment was recognized. We identified certain reporting units as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the valuation and business assumptions including the discount rate and financial forecasts used by management to estimate the fair value of certain reporting units included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management’s financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates and company specific risks. • We evaluated management’s ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing: • Actual results to historical forecasts. • Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers. • We evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from the October 1, 2019 annual measurement date to December 31, 2019. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the

Statements 1. Description of Business UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets and estimates of other current liabilities and other current receivables. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star ratings. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Products and Services For the Company’s OptumRx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product 44 Table of Contents revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Company’s home delivery, specialty and community pharmacies. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the member’s applicable co-payment. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue consists of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Revenues are also comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. OptumHealth’s service revenues include net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumInsight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. OptumInsight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , accounts receivables related to products and services were $ 4.3 billion and $ 3.9 billion , respectively. In 2019 and 2018 , the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 or 2018 . For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material. See Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2019. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90 % of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims that have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. 45 Table of Contents In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company’s intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. Pursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 46 Table of Contents Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $ 4.7 billion and $ 4.2 billion , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company’s Medicare Part D receivables amounted to $ 2.3 billion and $ 0.8 billion , respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Operating Leases The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period that closely matches the lease term. The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2019 . Intangible Assets The Company’s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2019 . 47 Table of Contents Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ( $ 8.3 billion and $ 7.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively), deposits under the Medicare Part D program ( $ 0.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 ), the RSF associated with the AARP Program, accruals for premium rebate payments under the ACA, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 : (in millions) 2019 2018 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period $ 1,908 $ 2,189 Net earnings 115 123 Acquisitions 90 102 Redemptions ( 618 ) ( 90 ) Distributions ( 69 ) ( 53 ) Fair value and other adjustments 300 ( 363 ) Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period $ 1,726 $ 1,908 Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over two to four years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Company’s common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Health Insurance Industry Tax The ACA includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax occurred in 2019. The Health Insurance Industry Tax will be levied in 2020, however, it was permanently repealed by Congress for subsequent years. 48 Table of Contents The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Company’s applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires the use of the current expected credit loss impairment model to develop an estimate of expected credit losses for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses and revises certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using a cumulative effect upon adoption approach on January 1, 2020. The adoption resulted in no material impact to the Company’s balance sheet, results of operations, equity or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20 and 2019-01 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative-effect upon adoption approach as of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $ 3.3 billion of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which, $ 668 million were classified as current liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, equity and cash flows. The Company has included the disclosures required by ASU 2016-02 above and in Note 12 . The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents 3.

The Company held $ 2.0 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds and dividend paying stocks with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 50 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2019 , by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,382 $ 3,388 $ 314 $ 314 Due after one year through five years 11,966 12,159 391 392 Due after five years through ten years 8,307 8,643 144 144 Due after ten years 3,437 3,531 123 125 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,425 6,528 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,811 1,845 — — Total debt securities $ 35,328 $ 36,094 $ 972 $ 975 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses December 31, 2019 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 616 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 616 $ ( 4 ) State and municipal obligations 440 ( 5 ) — — 440 ( 5 ) Corporate obligations 1,903 ( 7 ) 740 ( 4 ) 2,643 ( 11 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 657 ( 3 ) 333 ( 3 ) 990 ( 6 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 406 ( 3 ) — — 406 ( 3 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 4,022 $ ( 22 ) $ 1,073 $ ( 7 ) $ 5,095 $ ( 29 ) December 31, 2018 U.S. government and agency obligations $ 998 $ ( 7 ) $ 1,425 $ ( 35 ) $ 2,423 $ ( 42 ) State and municipal obligations 1,334 ( 11 ) 2,491 ( 46 ) 3,825 ( 57 ) Corporate obligations 8,105 ( 109 ) 4,239 ( 109 ) 12,344 ( 218 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,296 ( 22 ) 2,388 ( 84 ) 3,684 ( 106 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 622 ( 7 ) 459 ( 13 ) 1,081 ( 20 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 12,355 $ ( 156 ) $ 11,002 $ ( 287 ) $ 23,357 $ ( 443 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2019 were generated from approximately 3,000 positions out of a total of 31,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. 51 Table of Contents 4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: • Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); • Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and • Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques that rely heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. 52 Table of Contents Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt and equity securities. Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt securities. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,837 $ 148 $ — $ 10,985 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,369 184 — 3,553 State and municipal obligations — 5,926 — 5,926 Corporate obligations 70 17,923 249 18,242 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,528 — 6,528 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,845 — 1,845 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,439 32,406 249 36,094 Equity securities 1,734 22 — 1,756 Assets under management 1,123 1,918 35 3,076 Total assets at fair value $ 17,133 $ 34,494 $ 284 $ 51,911 Percentage of total assets at fair value 33 % 66 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,757 $ 109 $ — $ 10,866 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,060 345 — 3,405 State and municipal obligations — 7,121 — 7,121 Corporate obligations 39 14,950 173 15,162 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 4,852 — 4,852 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,358 — 1,358 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,099 28,626 173 31,898 Equity securities 1,832 13 — 1,845 Assets under management 1,086 1,938 8 3,032 Total assets at fair value $ 16,774 $ 30,686 $ 181 $ 47,641 Percentage of total assets at fair value 35 % 65 % — % 100 % 53 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value December 31, 2019 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 541 $ 181 $ 253 $ 975 $ 972 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 45,078 $ — $ 45,078 $ 40,278 December 31, 2018 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 260 $ 65 $ 295 $ 620 $ 621 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 37,944 $ — $ 37,944 $ 36,554 The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Maturities of commercial paper and long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows: (in millions) 2020 $ 3,870 2021 3,325 2022 3,190 2023 2,300 2024 1,675 Thereafter 26,660 Commercial Paper and Revolving Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. The Company has $ 4.4 billion five-year, $ 4.4 billion three-year and $ 3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature in December 2024 , December 2022 and December 2020 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 2.4 % to 2.6 % . Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2019 . 9. Income Taxes The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Current Provision: Federal $ 2,629 $ 2,897 $ 3,597 State and local 319 219 314 Foreign 564 404 254 Total current provision 3,512 3,520 4,165 Deferred provision (benefit) 230 42 ( 965 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 3,742 $ 3,562 $ 3,200 58 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: (in millions, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ 3,776 21.0 % $ 3,348 21.0 % $ 4,908 35.0 % Change in tax law — — — — ( 1,199 ) ( 8.6 ) State income taxes, net of federal benefit 271 1.5 168 1.0 197 1.4 Share-based awards - excess tax benefit ( 132 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 161 ) ( 1.0 ) ( 319 ) ( 2.3 ) Non-deductible compensation 119 0.7 117 0.7 175 1.3 Health insurance industry tax — — 552 3.5 — — Foreign rate differential ( 214 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 203 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 282 ) ( 2.0 ) Other, net ( 78 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 259 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 280 ) ( 2.0 ) Provision for income taxes $ 3,742 20.8 % $ 3,562 22.3 % $ 3,200 22.8 % Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 Deferred income tax assets: Accrued expenses and allowances $ 654 $ 551 U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 260 190 Share-based compensation 97 91 Nondeductible liabilities 184 184 Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards 420 426 Lease liability 892 — Other-domestic 179 306 Other-non-U.S. 329 337 Subtotal 3,015 2,085 Less: valuation allowances ( 147 ) ( 84 ) Total deferred income tax assets 2,868 2,001 Deferred income tax liabilities: U.S. federal and state intangible assets ( 2,370 ) ( 2,131 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets ( 735 ) ( 709 ) Capitalized software ( 683 ) ( 603 ) Depreciation and amortization ( 301 ) ( 266 ) Prepaid expenses ( 172 ) ( 152 ) Outside basis in partnerships ( 317 ) ( 300 ) Lease right-of-use asset ( 887 ) — Other-domestic ( 177 ) — Other-non-U.S. ( 219 ) ( 314 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 5,861 ) ( 4,475 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities $ ( 2,993 ) $ ( 2,474 ) Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 62 million expire beginning in 2022 through 2037 and $ 179 million have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2020 through 2039, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. 59 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 1,056 $ 598 $ 263 Gross increases: Current year tax positions 512 487 356 Prior year tax positions 2 87 40 Gross decreases: Prior year tax positions ( 96 ) ( 84 ) ( 33 ) Settlements ( 46 ) ( 20 ) ( 24 ) Statute of limitations lapses ( 5 ) ( 12 ) ( 4 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 1,423 $ 1,056 $ 598 The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $ 90 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company recognized $ 19 million , $ 6 million and $ 14 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $ 76 million and $ 95 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2019 , there were $ 852 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017, 2018 and 2019 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2013 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2014 and forward. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2019 , the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.” For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company’s regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 5.6 billion , including $ 1.3 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company’s regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 3.7 billion , including $ 1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $ 22.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $ 9.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 . Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in 60 Table of Contents open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2018, the Board renewed the Company’s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Common share repurchases, shares 22 19 Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 245.97 $ 236.72 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 5,500 $ 4,500 Board authorized shares remaining 72 94 Dividends In June 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $4.32 compared to $3.60 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2018. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 11. Share-Based Compensation The Company’s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had 32 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of December 31, 2019 , there were also 5 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Stock Options Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is summarized in the table below: Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) (in years) (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period 35 $ 131 Granted 7 260 Exercised ( 9 ) 94 Forfeited ( 1 ) 212 Outstanding at end of period 32 166 6.5 $ 4,106 Exercisable at end of period 15 114 5.0 2,716 Vested and expected to vest, end of period 31 165 6.4 4,068 Restricted Shares Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is summarized in the table below: (shares in millions) Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period 6 $ 163 Granted 2 259 Vested ( 3 ) 147 Nonvested at end of period 5 207 61 Table of Contents Other Share-Based Compensation Data (in millions, except per share amounts) For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Stock Options Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share $ 46 $ 43 $ 29 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised 1,398 1,431 1,473 Restricted Shares Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share 259 229 163 Total fair value of restricted shares vested $ 545 $ 521 $ 460 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Number of shares purchased 1 2 2 Share-Based Compensation Items Share-based compensation expense, before tax $ 697 $ 638 $ 597 Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects 641 587 531 Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises 201 239 431 (in millions, except years) December 31, 2019 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards $ 714 Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense 1.3 Share-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Risk-free interest rate 1.5% - 2.5% 2.6% - 3.1% 1.9% - 2.1% Expected volatility 19.4% - 21.6% 18.7% - 19.3% 18.5% - 20.7% Expected dividend yield 1.4% - 1.8% 1.3% - 1.5% 1.4% - 1.6% Forfeiture rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Expected life in years 5.3 5.6 5.7 Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $ 1.4 billion and $ 988 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 62 Table of Contents 12. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs were $ 1.0 billion , $ 751 million and $ 710 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively, and included immaterial variable and short-term lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $ 746 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , which were classified within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.6 years and 3.9 % , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Minimum Lease Payments 2020 $ 804 2021 723 2022 604 2023 499 2024 402 Thereafter 1,671 Total future minimum lease payments 4,703 Less imputed interest ( 744 ) Total $ 3,959 The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $ 98 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $ 1.2 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data 63 Table of Contents validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 13. Business Combinations During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company completed several business combinations for total cash consideration of $ 9.9 billion . The total consideration exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $ 8.9 billion , of which $ 2.0 billion has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $ 6.9 billion to goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Acquired tangible assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,542 Accounts receivable and other current assets 1,788 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 1,969 Medical costs payable ( 679 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 1,869 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 1,488 ) Total net tangible assets $ 1,263 The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent and tax liabilities, are finalized. See Note 6 for a summary of the acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to acquired finite-lived intangible assets. The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2019 , acquired entities’ impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2018 were immaterial for both periods. The pro forma effects of the acquisitions on net earnings were immaterial for both years. 14. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s four reportable segments derives its revenues: • UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being 64 Table of Contents services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits and health care delivery. • OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of individuals, enabling population health through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. • OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. • OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. The Company’s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 33 % , 30 % and 28 % for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 96 % of consolidated total revenues for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 72 % and 76 % of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global. 65 Table of Contents The following table presents the reportable segment financial information: Optum (in millions) UnitedHealthcare OptumHealth OptumInsight OptumRx Optum Eliminations Optum Corporate and Eliminations Consolidated 2019 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 183,783 $ 5,916 $ — $ — $ — $ 5,916 $ — $ 189,699 Products — 31 116 31,450 — 31,597 — 31,597 Services 8,922 5,732 3,630 689 — 10,051 — 18,973 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 192,705 11,679 3,746 32,139 — 47,564 — 240,269 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 17,966 6,239 42,093 ( 1,661 ) 64,637 ( 64,637 ) — Investment and other income 1,137 672 21 56 — 749 — 1,886 Total revenues $ 193,842 $ 30,317 $ 10,006 $ 74,288 $ ( 1,661 ) $ 112,950 $ ( 64,637 ) $ 242,155 Earnings from operations $ 10,326 $ 2,963 $ 2,494 $ 3,902 $ — $ 9,359 $ — $ 19,685 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,704 ) ( 1,704 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 10,326 $ 2,963 $ 2,494 $ 3,902 $ — $ 9,359 $ ( 1,704 ) $ 17,981 Total assets $ 88,250 $ 40,444 $ 15,181 $ 36,346 $ — $ 91,971 $ ( 6,332 ) $ 173,889 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 841 573 495 162 — 1,230 — 2,071 Depreciation and amortization 926 565 672 557 — 1,794 — 2,720 2018 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 174,282 $ 3,805 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,805 $ — $ 178,087 Products — 52 111 29,438 — 29,601 — 29,601 Services 8,366 4,925 3,280 612 — 8,817 — 17,183 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 182,648 8,782 3,391 30,050 — 42,223 — 224,871 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 14,882 5,596 39,440 ( 1,409 ) 58,509 ( 58,509 ) — Investment and other income 828 481 21 46 — 548 — 1,376 Total revenues $ 183,476 $ 24,145 $ 9,008 $ 69,536 $ ( 1,409 ) $ 101,280 $ ( 58,509 ) $ 226,247 Earnings from operations $ 9,113 $ 2,430 $ 2,243 $ 3,558 $ — $ 8,231 $ — $ 17,344 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,400 ) ( 1,400 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 9,113 $ 2,430 $ 2,243 $ 3,558 $ — $ 8,231 $ ( 1,400 ) $ 15,944 Total assets $ 82,938 $ 29,837 $ 11,039 $ 33,912 $ — $ 74,788 $ ( 5,505 ) $ 152,221 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 761 593 517 192 — 1,302 — 2,063 Depreciation and amortization 845 439 654 490 — 1,583 — 2,428 2017 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 154,709 $ 3,744 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,744 $ — $ 158,453 Products — 44 106 26,216 — 26,366 — 26,366 Services 7,890 4,013 2,849 565 — 7,427 — 15,317 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 162,599 7,801 2,955 26,781 — 37,537 — 200,136 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 12,429 5,127 36,954 ( 1,227 ) 53,283 ( 53,283 ) — Investment and other income 658 340 5 20 — 365 — 1,023 Total revenues $ 163,257 $ 20,570 $ 8,087 $ 63,755 $ ( 1,227 ) $ 91,185 $ ( 53,283 ) $ 201,159 Earnings from operations $ 8,498 $ 1,823 $ 1,770 $ 3,118 $ — $ 6,711 $ — $ 15,209 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,186 ) ( 1,186 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 8,498 $ 1,823 $ 1,770 $ 3,118 $ — $ 6,711 $ ( 1,186 ) $ 14,023 Total assets $ 76,676 $ 26,931 $ 11,273 $ 29,551 $ — $ 67,755 $ ( 5,373 ) $ 139,058 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software 737 510 588 188 — 1,286 — 2,023 Depreciation and amortization 758 380 614 493 — 1,487 — 2,245 66 Table of Contents 15.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2019 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 67 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2019 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2019 , the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. 68 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2019. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 14, 2020 69 Table of Contents ITEM 9B.

Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health care industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global; • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; and • OptumRx.

UnitedHealthcare’s market position is built on: • strong local-market relationships; • the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; • service and advanced technology, including digital consumer engagement; • competitive medical and operating cost positions; • effective clinical engagement; • extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and • innovation for customers and consumers.

In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1.3 million physicians and other health care professionals and more than 6,000 hospitals and other facilities. 1 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under “Government Regulation” and in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides access to medical services for 27 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners, including employer customers serving people across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. Products are offered through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs). Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees’ dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals served by UnitedHealth Group makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has relationships with network care providers that integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payments and care management programs, and enable us to jointly better manage health care and improve quality across populations. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. In addition, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual distributes its products through professional employer organizations, associations and through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s diverse product portfolio offers employers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provides the flexibility to meet a full spectrum of their coverage needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s major product families include: Traditional Products. Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options, and offer a spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. Consumer Engagement Products. Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals’ responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs, consumer education and other digital offerings. Clinical and Pharmacy Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy care services products, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging consumers and providing cost-saving options. Consumers served by UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual can access clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, which contribute to improved health and lowered medical expenses. Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on offering type (risk-based or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts or individual consumers) and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s clinical programs include: • wellness programs; • decision support; 2 Table of Contents • utilization management; • case and disease management; • complex condition management; • on-site programs, including biometrics and flu shots; • incentives to reinforce positive behavior change; • mental health/substance use disorder management; and • employee assistance programs.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement services include care management and clinical management programs, a nurse health line service, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.

Products are also offered through employer groups and agent channels. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s major product categories include: Medicare Advantage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 4.9 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2018. Built on more than 20 years of experience, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. Through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed 1.5 million in-home preventive care visits in 2018 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams 3 Table of Contents to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people’s needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2018, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.0 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 4.7 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. Medicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is currently serving 4.9 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at a diversity of price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program. Premium revenues from CMS represented 30% of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community & State UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), Dual SNPs (DSNPs), Aged, Blind and Disabled and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2018, UnitedHealthcare Community & State participated in programs in 30 states and the District of Columbia, and served 6.5 million people; including 1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 15 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation, including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community & State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community & State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants that can affect people’s health status and health system usage. Approximately 75% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only 50% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care, which represents a population of nearly 8 million people; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care. This expansion includes integrated care management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. UnitedHealthcare Community & State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model enables UnitedHealthcare Community & State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care; typically, the 5% who are most at risk drive over 50% of states’ medical costs. 4 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare Global UnitedHealthcare Global serves 6.2 million people with medical benefits, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru but also in more than 130 other countries.

During 2018, Optum Bank processed nearly $160 billion in digital medical payments to physicians and other health care providers. Organizations across the health system rely on Optum to manage and improve payment flows through its highly automated, scalable, digital payment systems. OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served, or on a fee-for-service basis, where it delivers medical services to patients in exchange for a contracted fee. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies).

Many of OptumInsight’s software and information products and professional services are delivered over extended periods, often several years.

We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies. In addition, our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . In December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or Tax Reform). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed existing United States tax law and included numerous provisions that affected our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For instance, Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changed business-related exclusions and deductions and credits. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) imposed requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; included contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extended parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; added federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthened enforcement and imposed higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposed criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. 8 Table of Contents ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where adopted by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that state’s regulation. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the ACA, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices that involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. 9 Table of Contents The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations OptumRx’s businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies that participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Federal and state legislation of PBM activities affect both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) requirements to use particular care providers or distribution channel, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. Additionally, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations and credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards that impact PBM pharmacy activities. While these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. 10 Table of Contents International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services, including organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants and business combinations also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve, which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” 12 Table of Contents “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. In addition, our OptumHealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer’s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2018 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2018 would have been reduced by approximately $305 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could 13 Table of Contents expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk that they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. For example, some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA are being considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified or repealed or replaced. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part; and a federal district court struck down the ACA in its entirety as unconstitutional in 2018. That opinion has been stayed and appealed. Further, the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Global business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar, while the Banmédica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations that could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. 14 Table of Contents As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. 15 Table of Contents We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. For example, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. Additionally, such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns that could negatively affect our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events that could negatively affect our systems, our customers’ data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use protected personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) overhauled data protection laws in the European Union. The new regulation superseded 16 Table of Contents prior European Union privacy and data protection legislation, imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, goes into effect in 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, OptumRx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the FDA and Boards of Pharmacy. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, South America and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger 17 Table of Contents and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other health care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful and relevant to consumers, we may not remain competitive, and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage, and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, divert management’s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Our health care benefits businesses have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of some of our businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or 18 Table of Contents otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. While we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders’ equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies’ products. If we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions, such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum’s financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2018 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. 20 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2018 , our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $68 billion , representing 45% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems’ capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary 21 Table of Contents information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES To support our business operations in the United States and other countries we own and lease real properties. Our various reportable segments use these facilities for their respective business purposes, and we believe these current facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are adequate for our anticipated future needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information required by this Item 3 is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth under the captions “Legal Matters” and “Governmental Investigations, Audits and Reviews” in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES MARKET AND HOLDERS Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol UNH. On January 31, 2019, there were 11,948 registered holders of record of our common stock. DIVIDEND POLICY In June 2018, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s annual cash dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share compared to $3.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2017. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 22 Table of Contents ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $256.15 per share. As of December 31, 2018, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 94 million shares of our common stock. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following performance graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 index, the S&P Health Care Index and the Dow Jones US Industrial Average Index for the five-year period ended December 31, 2018 . We have also included the customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies that we have compared ourselves to in prior years. We believe that these indices provide a more meaningful comparison than the previous subset of the Fortune 50 given our diverse businesses. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2013 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid. The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson & Johnson. We are not included in this Fortune 50 Group index. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. 23 Table of Contents 12/13 12/14 12/15 12/16 12/17 12/18 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00 $ 136.46 $ 161.37 $ 223.35 $ 312.29 $ 357.64 S&P Health Care Index 100.00 125.34 133.97 130.37 159.15 169.44 Dow Jones US Industrial Average 100.00 110.04 110.28 128.47 164.58 158.85 S&P 500 Index 100.00 113.69 115.26 129.05 157.22 150.33 Fortune 50 Group 100.00 105.33 108.75 123.33 126.45 103.96 The stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global; • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; and • OptumRx. Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2019 reflected the impact of the moratorium. The industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. 25 Table of Contents Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2018, we served nearly 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2018, our contracts with value-based elements totaled $74 billion in annual spending, including $18 billion through risk-transfer agreements. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2019 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of 3.4%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products, such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. Tax Reform. Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing United States tax law, including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. In 2018, the impact of Tax Reform was partially offset by the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Health Insurance Industry Tax. After a moratorium in 2017, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018 was $14.3 billion, with our portion being $2.6 billion. The return of the tax impacted year-over-year comparability of our financial results, including revenues, the medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio and effective tax rate. A one year moratorium is imposed on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS The following represents a summary of select 2018 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2017 . • Consolidated revenues increased by 12% , UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 12% and Optum revenues grew 11% . • UnitedHealthcare’s addition of 2.2 million people through acquisition and 250,000 through organic growth was offset by 2.9 million fewer people served as a result of completion of its commitment under the TRICARE military health care program. • Earnings from operations increased by 14% , including increases of 7% at UnitedHealthcare and 23% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share increased 14% to $12.19 . • Cash flows from operations were $15.7 billion , an increase of 16% . 26 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Revenues: Premiums $ 178,087 $ 158,453 $ 144,118 $ 19,634 12 % $ 14,335 10 % Products 29,601 26,366 26,658 3,235 12 (292 ) (1 ) Services 17,183 15,317 13,236 1,866 12 2,081 16 Investment and other income 1,376 1,023 828 353 35 195 24 Total revenues 226,247 201,159 184,840 25,088 12 16,319 9 Operating costs: Medical costs 145,403 130,036 117,038 15,367 12 12,998 11 Operating costs 34,074 29,557 28,401 4,517 15 1,156 4 Cost of products sold 26,998 24,112 24,416 2,886 12 (304 ) (1 ) Depreciation and amortization 2,428 2,245 2,055 183 8 190 9 Total operating costs 208,903 185,950 171,910 22,953 12 14,040 8 Earnings from operations 17,344 15,209 12,930 2,135 14 2,279 18 Interest expense (1,400 ) (1,186 ) (1,067 ) (214 ) 18 (119 ) 11 Earnings before income taxes 15,944 14,023 11,863 1,921 14 2,160 18 Provision for income taxes (3,562 ) (3,200 ) (4,790 ) (362 ) 11 1,590 (33 ) Net earnings 12,382 10,823 7,073 1,559 14 3,750 53 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (396 ) (265 ) (56 ) (131 ) 49 (209 ) 373 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 11,986 $ 10,558 $ 7,017 $ 1,428 14 % $ 3,541 50 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 12.19 $ 10.72 $ 7.25 $ 1.47 14 % $ 3.47 48 % Medical care ratio (a) 81.6 % 82.1 % 81.2 % (0.5 )% 0.9 % Operating cost ratio 15.1 14.7 15.4 0.4 (0.7 ) Operating margin 7.7 7.6 7.0 0.1 0.6 Tax rate 22.3 22.8 40.4 (0.5 ) (17.6 ) Net earnings margin (b) 5.3 5.2 3.8 0.1 1.4 Return on equity (c) 24.4 % 24.4 % 19.4 % — % 5.0 % (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through risk-based products and medical cost trends. The MCR decreased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which more than offset business mix changes and a lower level of favorable reserve development. 27 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information on our segments.

Fee-based commercial group business declined primarily due to customers converting their retirees to Medicare Advantage plans, as well as certain customers expanding the number of carriers and reconfiguring geographies served. Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states adding new carriers to existing programs, reduced enrollment from state efforts to manage eligibility status and the sale of our New Mexico Medicaid plan. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. International growth was primarily driven by an acquisition in the first quarter. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served across its risk-based businesses, a higher revenue membership mix, rate increases for underlying medical cost trends and the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. UnitedHealthcare’s operating margin decreased slightly due to the performance of our traditional community-based TANF Medicaid business. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below, as well as productivity and overall cost management initiatives. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery and behavioral health, digital consumer engagement and health financial services. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in data analytics product and service offerings and managed services as well as organic and acquisition-related growth in advisory services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, home delivery services, and overall prescription growth. OptumRx fulfilled 1,343 million and 1,298 million adjusted scripts in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 29 Table of Contents 2017 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2016 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenue The increase in revenue was primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across the Optum business. The increase was partially offset by revenue decreases due to the withdrawals of the ACA-compliant products in the individual market and the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends. The MCR increased due to the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, offset primarily by the reduction in individual ACA business, medical management initiatives and an increase in favorable medical cost reserve development. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of Tax Reform and the Health Insurance Tax moratorium. The provision for income taxes included a $1.2 billion benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which were partially offset by the reduction of people served in ACA-compliant individual products and the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. The increase in UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations was led by diversified growth and increased operating margin. The 2016 results included losses in ACA-compliant individual products and guaranty fund assessments. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management services and business process services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to client and consumer growth. In 2017, OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts compared to 1.2 billion in 2016. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of 30 Table of Contents statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In both 2018 and 2017, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 15,713 $ 13,596 $ 9,795 $ 2,117 $ 3,801 Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 4,134 — 990 4,134 (990 ) Proceeds from common share issuances 838 688 429 150 259 Customer funds administered — 3,172 1,692 (3,172 ) 1,480 Other — — 37 — (37 ) Total sources of cash 20,685 17,456 12,943 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (5,997 ) (2,131 ) (1,760 ) (3,866 ) (371 ) Cash dividends paid (3,320 ) (2,773 ) (2,261 ) (547 ) (512 ) Common share repurchases (4,500 ) (1,500 ) (1,280 ) (3,000 ) (220 ) Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of issuances — (2,615 ) — 2,615 (2,615 ) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,063 ) (2,023 ) (1,705 ) (40 ) (318 ) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (4,099 ) (4,319 ) (5,927 ) 220 1,608 Other (1,743 ) (539 ) (581 ) (1,204 ) 42 Total uses of cash (21,722 ) (15,900 ) (13,514 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (78 ) (5 ) 78 (73 ) (83 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,115 ) $ 1,551 $ (493 ) $ (2,666 ) $ 2,044 2018 Cash Flows Compared to 2017 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings in 2018 and the impact to 2017 cash flows from operating activities due to a change in net deferred tax liabilities from Tax Reform, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net issuances of debt in 2018 compared to net repayments in 2017, an increase in cash paid for acquisitions, increased share repurchases and a decrease in customer funds administered due to the timing of government payments. 2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by the change in net deferred tax liabilities driven by tax reform. 31 Table of Contents Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances, which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2018 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $44.7 billion included $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $925 million was available for general corporate use), $31.9 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2018 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of December 31, 2018, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2018 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2018 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 94 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Dividends. In June 2018, our Board increased our annual cash dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share from $3.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 32 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2018, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2019 2020 to 2021 2022 to 2023 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 3,463 $ 8,970 $ 7,396 $ 37,988 $ 57,817 Operating leases 669 1,103 761 1,343 3,876 Purchase and other obligations (b) 1,216 2,205 808 175 4,404 Other liabilities (c) 1,206 260 257 5,213 6,936 Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d) 1,276 380 25 227 1,908 Total contractual obligations $ 7,830 $ 12,918 $ 9,247 $ 44,946 $ 74,941 (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more detail. (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 . (c) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements, unrecognized tax benefits and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.” (d) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as “Thereafter.” Pending Acquisitions. In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a company in the health care sector for a total of approximately $4.3 billion, which is not reflected in the table above. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2018, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2018 , our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. 33 Table of Contents In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2018, 2017 and 2016 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $320 million , $690 million and $220 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2018 : Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 550 (0.50) 366 (0.25) 182 0.25 (181 ) 0.50 (362 ) 0.75 (541 ) Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2018 : Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 703 2 469 1 234 (1) (234 ) (2) (469 ) (3) (703 ) 34 Table of Contents The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2018 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2018 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2018 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $140 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: • Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. • Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview- Business Trends and the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. 35 Table of Contents • Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. • Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. As of October 1, 2018, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2018. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2018 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. As of December 31, 2018, we had $14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2018, $9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, $30 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $32 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. 36 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2018 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 276 $ 189 $ (2,242 ) $ (5,017 ) 1 138 94 (1,140 ) (2,724 ) (1) (138 ) (94 ) 1,118 3,155 (2) (276 ) (189 ) 2,196 6,953 December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum (a) Interest Expense Per Annum (a) Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 300 $ 170 $ (1,958 ) $ (4,546 ) 1 150 85 (933 ) (2,460 ) (1) (150 ) (85 ) 950 2,923 (2) (197 ) (133 ) 1,773 6,414 (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense in 2017, as the rate cannot fall below zero. (b) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $600 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 12, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinions These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. / S / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 12, 2019 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. 39 Table

of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Description of Business UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets and estimates of other current liabilities and other current receivables. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star ratings. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Products and Services For the Company’s OptumRx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacy facilities. Product 45 Table of Contents revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Company’s mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the member’s applicable co-payment. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Company’s mail-service pharmacy. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue consists of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Revenues are also comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. OptumHealth’s service revenues include net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumInsight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. OptumInsight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , accounts receivables related to products and services were $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion , respectively. In 2018 and 2017 , the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 or 2017 . For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material. See Note 13 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2018. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims that have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost 46 Table of Contents trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company’s intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. Pursuant to the Company’s agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. 47 Table of Contents The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion , respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Intangible Assets The Company’s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ( $7.5 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively), deposits under the Medicare Part D program, the RSF associated with the AARP Program, accruals for premium rebate payments under the ACA, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. 48 Table of Contents Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : (in millions) 2018 2017 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period $ 2,189 $ 2,012 Net earnings 123 71 Acquisitions 102 565 Redemptions (90 ) (309 ) Distributions (53 ) (38 ) Fair value and other adjustments (363 ) (112 ) Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period $ 1,908 $ 2,189 Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over two to five years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Company’s common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Health Insurance Industry Tax The ACA includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will occur in 2019. The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Company’s applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11 and 2018-20 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, the Company elected to not 49 Table of Contents recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense the leases over a straight-line basis for the term of those leases. ASU 2016-02 requires new disclosures that depict the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows pertaining to an entity’s leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, using the cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption resulted in no material impact to the Company’s balance sheet, results of operations, equity or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01). Most notably, the new guidance requires that equity investments, with certain exemptions, be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income as opposed to other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2018, as required, and reclassified $ 24 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The Company held $2.0 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, Brazilian real denominated 50 Table of Contents fixed-income funds and dividend paying stocks, with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.5 billion and $ 0.9 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2018 , by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,560 $ 3,551 $ 150 $ 150 Due after one year through five years 12,432 12,297 213 212 Due after five years through ten years 7,362 7,270 129 129 Due after ten years 2,563 2,570 129 129 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 4,947 4,852 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,376 1,358 — — Total debt securities $ 32,240 $ 31,898 $ 621 $ 620 The fair value of available-for-sale investments with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses December 31, 2018 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 998 $ (7 ) $ 1,425 $ (35 ) $ 2,423 $ (42 ) State and municipal obligations 1,334 (11 ) 2,491 (46 ) 3,825 (57 ) Corporate obligations 8,105 (109 ) 4,239 (109 ) 12,344 (218 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,296 (22 ) 2,388 (84 ) 3,684 (106 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 622 (7 ) 459 (13 ) 1,081 (20 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 12,355 $ (156 ) $ 11,002 $ (287 ) $ 23,357 $ (443 ) December 31, 2017 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,249 $ (8 ) $ 1,027 $ (22 ) $ 2,276 $ (30 ) State and municipal obligations 2,599 (21 ) 866 (14 ) 3,465 (35 ) Corporate obligations 5,901 (23 ) 1,242 (21 ) 7,143 (44 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,657 (12 ) 1,162 (26 ) 2,819 (38 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 411 (3 ) 144 (3 ) 555 (6 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 11,817 $ (67 ) $ 4,441 $ (86 ) $ 16,258 $ (153 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2018 were generated from approximately 19,000 positions out of a total of 31,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. 51 Table of Contents 4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: • Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); • Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and • Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. There was no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds are estimated using valuation techniques that rely heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. 52 Table of Contents Assets Under Management.

Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. 59 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 598 $ 263 $ 224 Gross increases: Current year tax positions 487 356 37 Prior year tax positions 87 40 24 Gross decreases: Prior year tax positions (84 ) (33 ) (4 ) Settlements (20 ) (24 ) (6 ) Statute of limitations lapses (12 ) (4 ) (12 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 1,056 $ 598 $ 263 The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $118 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recognized $6 million , $14 million and $11 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $95 million and $84 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2013 and forward. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries in the United States are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. For both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company’s regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $23.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 . The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered “Well Capitalized” under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2018 , the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.” Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in 60 Table of Contents open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2018, the Board renewed the Company’s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2018 2017 Common share repurchases, shares 19 9 Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 236.72 $ 173.54 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 4,500 $ 1,500 Board authorized shares remaining 94 42 Dividends In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s annual dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share compared to $3.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2017. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 11. Share-Based Compensation The Company’s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had 42 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of December 31, 2018 , there were also 7 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $988 million and $865 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 62 Table of Contents 12. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $751 million , $710 million and $608 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Minimum Lease Payments 2019 $ 669 2020 592 2021 511 2022 423 2023 338 Thereafter 1,343 The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $83 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $1.3 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Pending Acquisition In December 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a company in the health care sector for a total of approximately $4.3 billion . Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. 63 Table of Contents On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. Those motions were argued in September 2018. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 13. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s four reportable segments derives its revenues: • UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits and health care delivery. • OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of individuals, enabling population health through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. • OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. • OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. The Company’s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 30% , 28% and 25% for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 96% , 96% and 97% of consolidated total revenues for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 64 Table of Contents 76% and 77% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2018 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 66 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2018 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2018 , the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. 67 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2018. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 12, 2019 68 Table of Contents ITEM 9B.
