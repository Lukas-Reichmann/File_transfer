Bible Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 3-;-EX-99.1:Investor Update4th Quarter 2023 December 2023 Exhibit 99.1 Disclaimer This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements based on current expectations, estimates and projections about M&T’s business, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. Statements regarding the potential effects of events or factors specific to M&T and/or the financial industry as a whole, as well as national and global events generally, including economic conditions, on M&T's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond M&T's control. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors"") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Examples of Future Factors include: the impact of M&T’s acquisition of People's United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) (as described in the next paragraph); events and developments in the financial services industry, including legislation, regulations and other government actions as well as business conditions affecting the industry and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; economic conditions including inflation and market volatility; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; domestic or international political developments and other geopolitical events, including international conflicts; governmental and public policy changes, including tax policy; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation; increasing price, product, and service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products and services; containing costs and expenses; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition, divestment and investment activities compared with M&T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. In addition, Future Factors related to the acquisition of People's United include, among others: the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized when expected or at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business, customer or employee relationships; M&T’s success in executing its business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing; the results and costs of integration efforts; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which M&T and its subsidiaries operate; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against M&T or its subsidiaries; and other factors related to the acquisition that may affect future results of M&T. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, as noted, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors. M&T provides further detail regarding these risks and uncertainties in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, including in the Risk Factors section of such report, as well as in other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T does not assume any duty and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Annualized, pro forma, projected, and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. This presentation also contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Management believes investors may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Please see the Appendix for reconciliation of GAAP with corresponding non-GAAP measures, as indicated in the presentation. Purpose To make a difference in people’s lives.

Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements based on current expectations, estimates and projections about M&T’s business, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. Statements regarding the potential effects of events or factors specific to M&T and/or the financial industry as a whole, as well as national and global events generally, including economic conditions, on M&T's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond M&T's control. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors"") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Examples of Future Factors include: the impact of M&T’s acquisition of People's United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) (as described in the next paragraph); events and developments in the financial services industry, including legislation, regulations and other government actions as well as business conditions affecting the industry and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; economic conditions including inflation and market volatility; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; domestic or international political developments and other geopolitical events, including international conflicts; governmental and public policy changes, including tax policy; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation; increasing price, product, and service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products and services; containing costs and expenses; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition, divestment and investment activities compared with M&T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. In addition, Future Factors related to the acquisition of People's United include, among others: the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized when expected or at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business, customer or employee relationships; M&T’s success in executing its business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing; the results and costs of integration efforts; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which M&T and its subsidiaries operate; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against M&T or its subsidiaries; and other factors related to the acquisition that may affect future results of M&T. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, as noted, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors. M&T provides further detail regarding these risks and uncertainties in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, including in the Risk Factors section of such report, as well as in other SEC filings.

Management believes investors may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful.

Bible Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 3-;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Disclaimer This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements based on current expectations, estimates and projections about M&T’s business, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. Statements regarding the potential effects of events or factors specific to M&T and/or the financial industry as a whole, as well as national and global events generally, including economic conditions, on M&T's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond M&T's control. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors"") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Examples of Future Factors include: the impact of M&T’s acquisition of People's United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) (as described in the next paragraph); events and developments in the financial services industry, including legislation, regulations and other government actions as well as business conditions affecting the industry and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; economic conditions including inflation and market volatility; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; domestic or international political developments and other geopolitical events, including international conflicts; governmental and public policy changes, including tax policy; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation; increasing price, product, and service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products and services; containing costs and expenses; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition, divestment and investment activities compared with M&T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. In addition, Future Factors related to the acquisition of People's United include, among others: the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized when expected or at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business, customer or employee relationships; M&T’s success in executing its business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing; the results and costs of integration efforts; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which M&T and its subsidiaries operate; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against M&T or its subsidiaries; and other factors related to the acquisition that may affect future results of M&T. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, as noted, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors. M&T provides further detail regarding these risks and uncertainties in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, including in the Risk Factors section of such report, as well as in other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T does not assume any duty and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Annualized, pro forma, projected, and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. This presentation also contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Management believes investors may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Please see the Appendix for reconciliation of GAAP with corresponding non-GAAP measures, as indicated in the presentation. Purpose To make a difference in people’s lives.

Bible Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 3","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Disclaimer This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement, including statements based on current expectations, estimates and projections about M&T’s business, and management’s beliefs and assumptions. Statements regarding the potential effects of events or factors specific to M&T and/or the financial industry as a whole, as well as national and global events generally, including economic conditions, on M&T's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond M&T's control. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“Future Factors"") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Examples of Future Factors include: the impact of M&T’s acquisition of People's United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) (as described in the next paragraph); events and developments in the financial services industry, including legislation, regulations and other government actions as well as business conditions affecting the industry and/or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; economic conditions including inflation and market volatility; changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans, and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; the impact of changes in market values on trust-related revenues; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; domestic or international political developments and other geopolitical events, including international conflicts; governmental and public policy changes, including tax policy; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, regulatory agencies or legislation; increasing price, product, and service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products and services; containing costs and expenses; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries’ future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition, divestment and investment activities compared with M&T's initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. In addition, Future Factors related to the acquisition of People's United include, among others: the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized when expected or at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business, customer or employee relationships; M&T’s success in executing its business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing; the results and costs of integration efforts; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which M&T and its subsidiaries operate; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against M&T or its subsidiaries; and other factors related to the acquisition that may affect future results of M&T. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, as noted, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors. M&T provides further detail regarding these risks and uncertainties in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, including in the Risk Factors section of such report, as well as in other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T does not assume any duty and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Annualized, pro forma, projected, and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. This presentation also contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Management believes investors may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Please see the Appendix for reconciliation of GAAP with corresponding non-GAAP measures, as indicated in the presentation. Purpose To make a difference in people’s lives.

FIRST AMERICAN FINANCIAL CORPORATION Date: October 24, 2019 By: /s/ Kenneth D. DeGiorgio Name: Kenneth D. DeGiorgio Title: Executive Vice President 3 -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 NEWS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FIRST AMERICAN FINANCIAL REPORTS third QUARTER 2019 RESULTS — Reports Earnings of $1.65 per Diluted Share — SANTA ANA, Calif., Oct. 24, 2019 – First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), a leading global provider of title insurance, settlement services and risk solutions for real estate transactions, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2019. Current Quarter Highlights • Total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 8 percent compared with last year - Closed orders up 21 percent, driven by an 89 percent increase in refinance orders - Average revenue per order down 6 percent, driven by a shift in the mix to lower-premium refinance transactions • Title Insurance and Services segment pretax margin of 16.5 percent - 16.4 percent excluding net realized investment gains • Commercial revenues of $199.6 million, up 9 percent compared with last year • Title Insurance and Services segment investment income of $72.0 million, up 18 percent compared with last year • Specialty Insurance segment pretax margin of 8.5 percent - 7.8 percent excluding net realized investment gains • Debt-to-capital ratio of 18.5 percent • Cash flow from operations of $310.6 million, compared with $230.8 million last year Selected Financial Information ($ in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Total revenue $ 1,671.2 $ 1,542.2 Income before taxes 245.3 195.6 Net income $ 187.2 $ 151.5 Net income per diluted share 1.65 1.34 Total revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $1.7 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared with the third quarter of 2018. Net income in the current quarter was $187.2 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, compared with net income of $151.5 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018. Net realized investment gains in the current quarter were $1.5 million, or 1 cent per diluted share, compared with net realized investment gains of $11.1 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, last year. “The company delivered another good quarter, as increased transactions across our businesses drove strong growth in revenue and earnings,” said Dennis J. Gilmore, chief executive officer at First American Financial Corporation. “In the purchase market, open order growth turned positive for the first time since early 2018, and our commercial business continued its strong performance. Lower interest rates drove substantial growth in our refinance business. Effective expense management and higher -more- First American Financial Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results Page 2 investment income , coupled with the broad-based revenue growth across key markets, propelled the company’s strong financial performance this quarter. “We are optimistic heading into the fourth quarter given current purchase and refinance order trends as well as a robust commercial pipeline. Although recent Fed funds rate reductions will impact our investment income, we expect that current business conditions and the efficiency of our operations will enable us to deliver strong financial results in the final quarter of 2019.” Title Insurance and Services ($ in millions, except average revenue per order) Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 1,540.7 $ 1,413.8 Income before taxes $ 253.6 $ 206.5 Pretax margin 16.5 % 14.6 % Title open orders (1) 317,300 249,100 Title closed orders (1) 224,100 184,500 U.S. Commercial Total revenues $ 199.6 $ 183.5 Open orders 33,500 32,100 Closed orders 18,500 18,600 Average revenue per order $ 10,800 $ 9,900 (1) U.S. direct title insurance orders only Total revenues for the Title Insurance and Services segment during the third quarter were $1.5 billion, up 9 percent compared with the same quarter of 2018. Direct premiums and escrow fees were higher by 14 percent compared with the third quarter of 2018, driven by a 21 percent increase in closed orders and partly offset by a 6 percent decrease in the average revenue per direct title order. The decline in the average revenue per direct title order to $2,513 was due to a shift in the mix of direct orders closed to lower-premium refinance transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per direct title order from commercial transactions and higher residential real estate values. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one-quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were up 7 percent in the current quarter as compared with last year. Information and other revenues were $205.3 million this quarter, up $9.3 million, or 5 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to growth in real estate transactions that led to higher demand for our title information products. Investment income was $72.0 million in the third quarter, up $11.2 million, or 18 percent, benefiting from both an increase in average balances and higher short-term interest rates that led to an increase in interest income from the company’s investment portfolio and cash balances. Net realized investment gains totaled $0.5 million in the current quarter, compared with gains of $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. -more- First American Financial Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results Page 3 Personnel costs were $ 447.8 million in the third quarter, up $ 22.2 million, or 5 percent, compared with the same quarter of 201 8 . This increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation expense driven by improved financial results. Other operating expenses were $218.7 million in the third quarter, an increase of $17.8 million, or 9 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2018. The increase was largely attributable to higher production-related costs driven by growth in transaction activity, and to $7.0 million in lease impairments that were primarily due to consolidation of office locations related to a previous acquisition. The provision for policy losses and other claims was $50.5 million in the third quarter, or 4.0 percent of title premiums and escrow fees, compared with a 4.0 percent loss provision rate in the third quarter of 2018. The current quarter rate reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.0 percent for the current policy year and no change in the loss reserve estimates for prior policy years. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.8 million in the third quarter, down $0.2 million compared with the same period last year. Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $253.6 million in the third quarter, compared with $206.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. Pretax margin was 16.5 percent in the current quarter, compared with 14.6 percent last year. Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, the pretax margin was 16.4 percent this year, compared with 14.1 percent last year. Specialty Insurance ($ in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 129.2 $ 124.2 Income before taxes $ 11.0 $ 6.2 Pretax margin 8.5 % 5.0 % Total revenues for the Specialty Insurance segment were $129.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 4 percent compared with the third quarter of 2018. The home warranty business continued to grow revenues, while holding claims expense flat. The loss ratio in both our home warranty and property and casualty businesses declined, resulting in an improved loss ratio for the segment to 60.9 percent this quarter, compared with 65.4 percent in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment was 8.5 percent in the current quarter, compared with 5.0 percent in the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, the segment’s current quarter pretax margin was 7.8 percent, compared with 3.4 percent last year.

Current Quarter Highlights • Total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 8 percent compared with last year - Closed orders up 21 percent, driven by an 89 percent increase in refinance orders - Average revenue per order down 6 percent, driven by a shift in the mix to lower-premium refinance transactions • Title Insurance and Services segment pretax margin of 16.5 percent - 16.4 percent excluding net realized investment gains • Commercial revenues of $199.6 million, up 9 percent compared with last year • Title Insurance and Services segment investment income of $72.0 million, up 18 percent compared with last year • Specialty Insurance segment pretax margin of 8.5 percent - 7.8 percent excluding net realized investment gains • Debt-to-capital ratio of 18.5 percent • Cash flow from operations of $310.6 million, compared with $230.8 million last year Selected Financial Information ($ in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Total revenue $ 1,671.2 $ 1,542.2 Income before taxes 245.3 195.6 Net income $ 187.2 $ 151.5 Net income per diluted share 1.65 1.34 Total revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $1.7 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared with the third quarter of 2018. Net income in the current quarter was $187.2 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, compared with net income of $151.5 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018. Net realized investment gains in the current quarter were $1.5 million, or 1 cent per diluted share, compared with net realized investment gains of $11.1 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, last year. “The company delivered another good quarter, as increased transactions across our businesses drove strong growth in revenue and earnings,” said Dennis J. Gilmore, chief executive officer at First American Financial Corporation. “In the purchase market, open order growth turned positive for the first time since early 2018, and our commercial business continued its strong performance. Lower interest rates drove substantial growth in our refinance business. Effective expense management and higher -more- First American Financial Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results Page 2 investment income , coupled with the broad-based revenue growth across key markets, propelled the company’s strong financial performance this quarter. “We are optimistic heading into the fourth quarter given current purchase and refinance order trends as well as a robust commercial pipeline. Although recent Fed funds rate reductions will impact our investment income, we expect that current business conditions and the efficiency of our operations will enable us to deliver strong financial results in the final quarter of 2019.” Title Insurance and Services ($ in millions, except average revenue per order) Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 1,540.7 $ 1,413.8 Income before taxes $ 253.6 $ 206.5 Pretax margin 16.5 % 14.6 % Title open orders (1) 317,300 249,100 Title closed orders (1) 224,100 184,500 U.S. Commercial Total revenues $ 199.6 $ 183.5 Open orders 33,500 32,100 Closed orders 18,500 18,600 Average revenue per order $ 10,800 $ 9,900 (1) U.S. direct title insurance orders only Total revenues for the Title Insurance and Services segment during the third quarter were $1.5 billion, up 9 percent compared with the same quarter of 2018. Direct premiums and escrow fees were higher by 14 percent compared with the third quarter of 2018, driven by a 21 percent increase in closed orders and partly offset by a 6 percent decrease in the average revenue per direct title order. The decline in the average revenue per direct title order to $2,513 was due to a shift in the mix of direct orders closed to lower-premium refinance transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per direct title order from commercial transactions and higher residential real estate values. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one-quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were up 7 percent in the current quarter as compared with last year. Information and other revenues were $205.3 million this quarter, up $9.3 million, or 5 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to growth in real estate transactions that led to higher demand for our title information products. Investment income was $72.0 million in the third quarter, up $11.2 million, or 18 percent, benefiting from both an increase in average balances and higher short-term interest rates that led to an increase in interest income from the company’s investment portfolio and cash balances. Net realized investment gains totaled $0.5 million in the current quarter, compared with gains of $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. -more- First American Financial Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results Page 3 Personnel costs were $ 447.8 million in the third quarter, up $ 22.2 million, or 5 percent, compared with the same quarter of 201 8 . This increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation expense driven by improved financial results. Other operating expenses were $218.7 million in the third quarter, an increase of $17.8 million, or 9 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2018. The increase was largely attributable to higher production-related costs driven by growth in transaction activity, and to $7.0 million in lease impairments that were primarily due to consolidation of office locations related to a previous acquisition. The provision for policy losses and other claims was $50.5 million in the third quarter, or 4.0 percent of title premiums and escrow fees, compared with a 4.0 percent loss provision rate in the third quarter of 2018. The current quarter rate reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.0 percent for the current policy year and no change in the loss reserve estimates for prior policy years. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.8 million in the third quarter, down $0.2 million compared with the same period last year. Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $253.6 million in the third quarter, compared with $206.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. Pretax margin was 16.5 percent in the current quarter, compared with 14.6 percent last year. Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, the pretax margin was 16.4 percent this year, compared with 14.1 percent last year. Specialty Insurance ($ in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 129.2 $ 124.2 Income before taxes $ 11.0 $ 6.2 Pretax margin 8.5 % 5.0 % Total revenues for the Specialty Insurance segment were $129.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 4 percent compared with the third quarter of 2018. The home warranty business continued to grow revenues, while holding claims expense flat. The loss ratio in both our home warranty and property and casualty businesses declined, resulting in an improved loss ratio for the segment to 60.9 percent this quarter, compared with 65.4 percent in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment was 8.5 percent in the current quarter, compared with 5.0 percent in the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, the segment’s current quarter pretax margin was 7.8 percent, compared with 3.4 percent last year.

Current Quarter Highlights • Total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 1 percent compared with last year • Title Insurance and Services segment pretax margin of 17.0 percent - 16.5 percent excluding net realized investment gains • Commercial revenues of $180.4 million, down 2 percent compared with last year • Title Insurance and Services segment investment income of $71.0 million, up 37 percent compared with last year • Specialty Insurance segment pretax margin of 12.8 percent - 11.8 percent excluding net realized investment gains • Debt-to-capital ratio of 18.4 percent • Cash flow from operations of $266.7 million, compared with $210.9 million last year Selected Financial Information ($ in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Total revenue $ 1,498.6 $ 1,491.2 Income before taxes 229.5 202.0 Net income $ 186.7 $ 155.1 Net income per diluted share 1.64 1.37 Total revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 1 percent relative to the second quarter of 2018. Net income in the current quarter was $186.7 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared with net income of $155.1 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018. Net realized investment gains in the current quarter were $8.4 million, or 6 cents per diluted share, compared with net realized investment gains of $5.5 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, last year. The current quarter’s effective tax rate of 18.4 percent includes a benefit of $12.0 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, primarily due to the resolution of state tax matters from prior years. During the quarter, expenses totaling $1.7 million related to the previously disclosed information security incident were recorded in the corporate segment. “The company delivered outstanding financial results in the second quarter, including a record 17.0 percent pretax title margin,” said Dennis J. Gilmore, chief executive officer at First American -more- First American Financial Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results Page 2 Financial Corporation. “Low interest rates continue to strengthen the purchase market, drive s ubstantial growth in refinance activity and sustain a healthy commercial market. This quarter’s performance again benefited from effective expense management and higher investment income. “Looking to the second half of 2019, we are optimistic in light of current market trends. So far in July, refinance activity continues its robust growth and purchase open orders are trending positively. Moreover, we expect to see continued strength in our commercial business. Although the anticipated reduction of the Fed funds rate will impact our investment income, given current business conditions and the efficiency of our operations, we expect to deliver strong financial results in the second half of the year.” Title Insurance and Services ($ in millions, except average revenue per order) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 1,371.9 $ 1,369.0 Income before taxes $ 232.8 $ 209.6 Pretax margin 17.0 % 15.3 % Title open orders (1) 296,200 276,800 Title closed orders (1) 196,600 196,200 U.S. Commercial Total revenues $ 180.4 $ 184.8 Open orders 33,000 36,000 Closed orders 19,300 19,900 Average revenue per order $ 9,400 $ 9,300 (1) U.S. direct title insurance orders only. Total revenues for the Title Insurance and Services segment during the second quarter were $1.4 billion, flat compared with the same quarter of 2018. Direct premiums and escrow fees were higher by 1 percent compared with the second quarter of 2018, driven by a 1 percent increase in the average revenue per direct title order and closed orders that were essentially flat compared with last year. The growth in the average revenue per direct title order to $2,620 was primarily due to higher residential real estate values, partially offset by a shift in the mix of direct revenues to lower premium refinance transactions. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one-quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were down 3 percent in the current quarter as compared with last year. Information and other revenues were $197.8 million this quarter, down $8.3 million, or 4 percent, compared with the same quarter of last year. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues from the company’s centralized lender businesses and international operations. Investment income was $71.0 million in the second quarter, up $19.2 million, or 37 percent, benefiting from both an increase in average balances and rising short-term interest rates that drove higher interest income in the company’s investment portfolio and cash balances. Net realized investment -more- First American Financial Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results Page 3 gains totaled $ 6.9 million in the current quarter, compared with gains of $ 3 . 6 million in the second quarter of 201 8 .

This decline was primarily attributable to lower salary expense driven by lower average headcount, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. Other operating expenses were $194.1 million in the second quarter, down $8.3 million, or 4 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2018. The reduction was driven by a number of expense categories, including lower production-related costs and a decline in office-related purchases, partially offset by higher software expense. The provision for policy losses and other claims was $43.8 million in the second quarter, or 4.0 percent of title premiums and escrow fees, compared with a 4.0 percent loss provision rate in the second quarter of 2018. The current quarter rate reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.0 percent for the current policy year and no change in the loss reserve estimates for prior policy years. Depreciation and amortization expense was $31.1 million in the second quarter, an increase of $1.7 million, or 6 percent, compared with the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense associated with software development. Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $232.8 million in the second quarter, compared with $209.6 million in the second quarter of 2018. Pretax margin was 17.0 percent in the current quarter, compared with 15.3 percent last year. Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains and losses, the pretax margin was 16.5 percent this year, compared with 15.1 percent last year. Specialty Insurance ($ in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 123.0 $ 120.2 Income before taxes $ 15.7 $ 10.1 Pretax margin 12.8 % 8.4 % Total revenues for the Specialty Insurance segment were $123.0 million in the second quarter, an increase of 2 percent compared with the second quarter of 2018. The home warranty business benefited from lower claim losses driven by both lower claim frequency and severity, due in part to milder weather and improvements in claim cost management. The loss ratio for the segment improved to 56.4 percent this quarter, compared with 61.4 percent in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment was 12.8 percent in the current quarter, compared with 8.4 percent in the second quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of net realized gains and losses, the segment’s current quarter pretax margin was 11.8 percent, compared with 7.0 percent last year. -more- First American Financial Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results Page 4 Teleconference/Webcast First American’s second-quarter 2019 results will be discussed in more detail on Thursday, July 25, 2019, at 11 a.m. EDT, via teleconference.

Net income in the current quarter was $186.7 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared with net income of $155.1 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018. Net realized investment gains in the current quarter were $8.4 million, or 6 cents per diluted share, compared with net realized investment gains of $5.5 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, last year. The current quarter’s effective tax rate of 18.4 percent includes a benefit of $12.0 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, primarily due to the resolution of state tax matters from prior years. During the quarter, expenses totaling $1.7 million related to the previously disclosed information security incident were recorded in the corporate segment. “The company delivered outstanding financial results in the second quarter, including a record 17.0 percent pretax title margin,” said Dennis J. Gilmore, chief executive officer at First American -more- First American Financial Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results Page 2 Financial Corporation. “Low interest rates continue to strengthen the purchase market, drive s ubstantial growth in refinance activity and sustain a healthy commercial market. This quarter’s performance again benefited from effective expense management and higher investment income. “Looking to the second half of 2019, we are optimistic in light of current market trends. So far in July, refinance activity continues its robust growth and purchase open orders are trending positively. Moreover, we expect to see continued strength in our commercial business. Although the anticipated reduction of the Fed funds rate will impact our investment income, given current business conditions and the efficiency of our operations, we expect to deliver strong financial results in the second half of the year.” Title Insurance and Services ($ in millions, except average revenue per order) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 1,371.9 $ 1,369.0 Income before taxes $ 232.8 $ 209.6 Pretax margin 17.0 % 15.3 % Title open orders (1) 296,200 276,800 Title closed orders (1) 196,600 196,200 U.S. Commercial Total revenues $ 180.4 $ 184.8 Open orders 33,000 36,000 Closed orders 19,300 19,900 Average revenue per order $ 9,400 $ 9,300 (1) U.S. direct title insurance orders only. Total revenues for the Title Insurance and Services segment during the second quarter were $1.4 billion, flat compared with the same quarter of 2018. Direct premiums and escrow fees were higher by 1 percent compared with the second quarter of 2018, driven by a 1 percent increase in the average revenue per direct title order and closed orders that were essentially flat compared with last year. The growth in the average revenue per direct title order to $2,620 was primarily due to higher residential real estate values, partially offset by a shift in the mix of direct revenues to lower premium refinance transactions. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one-quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were down 3 percent in the current quarter as compared with last year. Information and other revenues were $197.8 million this quarter, down $8.3 million, or 4 percent, compared with the same quarter of last year. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues from the company’s centralized lender businesses and international operations. Investment income was $71.0 million in the second quarter, up $19.2 million, or 37 percent, benefiting from both an increase in average balances and rising short-term interest rates that drove higher interest income in the company’s investment portfolio and cash balances. Net realized investment -more- First American Financial Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results Page 3 gains totaled $ 6.9 million in the current quarter, compared with gains of $ 3 . 6 million in the second quarter of 201 8 . Personnel costs were $422.7 million in the second quarter, down $4.4 million, or 1 percent, compared with the same quarter of 2018. This decline was primarily attributable to lower salary expense driven by lower average headcount, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. Other operating expenses were $194.1 million in the second quarter, down $8.3 million, or 4 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2018. The reduction was driven by a number of expense categories, including lower production-related costs and a decline in office-related purchases, partially offset by higher software expense. The provision for policy losses and other claims was $43.8 million in the second quarter, or 4.0 percent of title premiums and escrow fees, compared with a 4.0 percent loss provision rate in the second quarter of 2018. The current quarter rate reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.0 percent for the current policy year and no change in the loss reserve estimates for prior policy years. Depreciation and amortization expense was $31.1 million in the second quarter, an increase of $1.7 million, or 6 percent, compared with the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense associated with software development. Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $232.8 million in the second quarter, compared with $209.6 million in the second quarter of 2018. Pretax margin was 17.0 percent in the current quarter, compared with 15.3 percent last year. Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains and losses, the pretax margin was 16.5 percent this year, compared with 15.1 percent last year. Specialty Insurance ($ in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 123.0 $ 120.2 Income before taxes $ 15.7 $ 10.1 Pretax margin 12.8 % 8.4 % Total revenues for the Specialty Insurance segment were $123.0 million in the second quarter, an increase of 2 percent compared with the second quarter of 2018. The home warranty business benefited from lower claim losses driven by both lower claim frequency and severity, due in part to milder weather and improvements in claim cost management. The loss ratio for the segment improved to 56.4 percent this quarter, compared with 61.4 percent in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment was 12.8 percent in the current quarter, compared with 8.4 percent in the second quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of net realized gains and losses, the segment’s current quarter pretax margin was 11.8 percent, compared with 7.0 percent last year. -more- First American Financial Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results Page 4 Teleconference/Webcast First American’s second-quarter 2019 results will be discussed in more detail on Thursday, July 25, 2019, at 11 a.m. EDT, via teleconference.
