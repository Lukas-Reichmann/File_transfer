Our Operations Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our workforce solutions and staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. When demand drops, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline at the same pace as revenues. In periods of economic contraction, we may have more significant expense deleveraging, as we believe it is prudent not to reduce selling and administrative expenses to levels that could negatively impact the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. 4 The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with a days sales outstanding of 56 days as December 31, 2022. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Due to our industry’s sensitivity to economic factors, the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short-term nature of staffing assignments, it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with certainty. As a result, we monitor a number of economic indicators, as well as recent business trends, to predict future revenue trends for each of the countries and territories where we operate. Based upon these anticipated trends, we determine what level of personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities. During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have helped create demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the global economy continues to grow and adapt with new technology, we are helping clients manage their workforce transformation and ensure they have the right skills now and in the future. Whether it is through workforce assessments, targeted training or by creating longer-term development paths, we help organizations and candidates adapt their skills to changing workforce needs. Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative, industrial and IT professional positions. These services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for more than 70 years with a primary focus on the areas of office and industrial services and solutions. Our Talent Based Outsourcing offering within our Manpower brand includes outcome-based solutions such as management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities. We provide IT resourcing and services under our Experis brand. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates’ workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our Experis brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise or continue. Our Talent Solutions brand specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and new solutions and creating added value that addresses our clients’ complex global workforce needs. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through exclusive outsourcing contracts. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative functions. Our Right Management offering includes our career management services that have historically been counter-cyclical to our staffing services, which helps to offset the impact of an economic downturn on our overall financial results. 5 Americas We provide services as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The Americas segment had 445 branch and 138 franchise offices as of December 31, 2022. In the United States, where we realized 71% of the Americas’ revenue, we had 302 branch and 131 franchise offices as of December 31, 2022, as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico, Canada and Argentina, we had 143 branch offices and 7 franchise offices as of December 31, 2022. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise. Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower® service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchisee sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise. Our Manpower and Experis operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. During 2022 in this segment, approximately 29% of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 17% from placing office staff, and 54% from placing professional and technical staff. For our United States operations in 2022, approximately 31% of the permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 11% from placing office staff, and 58% from placing professional and technical staff. Our Talent Solutions operations provide a variety of workforce solutions offerings including RPO, MSP and Right Management. Southern Europe We are a leading provider of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing services throughout Europe. The Southern Europe segment had 1,148 branch offices as of December 31, 2022. Our largest operations in this segment are in France (56% of the segment revenue) and Italy (20% of the segment revenue). During 2022 for our Southern Europe operations, approximately 72% of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 14% from placing office staff, and 14% from placing professional and technical staff. We conduct our operations in France as a leading workforce solutions and service provider through 606 branch offices as Manpower, Experis, including our Proservia brand, and Talent Solutions, and 166 branch offices under the name Supplay as of December 31, 2022. The employment services market in France calls for a wide range of our services including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. The temporary recruitment market is predominantly focused on recruitment for industrial positions. In 2022, we derived approximately 84% of our permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues in France from placing industrial and construction workers, 15% from the placing of office staff, and 1% from the placing of professional and technical staff. In Italy, we are a leading workforce solutions and services provider. As of December 31, 2022, ManpowerGroup Italy conducted operations through a network of 207 branch offices. It provides a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis or Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. In 2022, approximately 66% of our permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues in Italy were derived from placing industrial staff, 5% from placing office staff, including contact center staff, and 29% from placing professional and technical staff. 6 Northern Europe Our largest operations in Northern Europe are in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics and the Netherlands, providing a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services through Manpower, Experis, and Talent Solutions. Collectively, we operate through 332 branch offices in this region. During 2022 for our Northern Europe operations, approximately 38% of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 22% from placing office staff, and 40% from placing professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, where we have the largest operation in this segment, we are a leading provider of workforce solutions and services. As of December 31, 2022, we conducted operations in the United Kingdom as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through a network of 59 branch offices and also provided on-site services to clients who have significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. During 2022 for our United Kingdom operations, approximately 22% of permanent, temporary, and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 38% from the placing of office staff, and 40% from the placing of professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, we also conduct operations as Brook Street Bureau PLC, or Brook Street. Its core business is secretarial, office and light industrial recruitment. Brook Street operates as a local network of branches and competes primarily with local or regional independents. Brook Street’s revenues are comprised of temporary and contract placements as well as permanent recruitment. APME We operate through 137 branch offices in the Asia Pacific Middle East (APME) region. The largest of these operations are located in Japan, Australia, India and Korea, all of which operate through branch offices. Our APME operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. During 2022, approximately 8% of our APME permanent, temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 56% from placing office staff, and 36% from placing professional and technical staff. Competition We compete in the employment services industry by offering a broad range of services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, project-based workforce solutions, assessment and selection, training, career and talent management, managed service solutions, outsourcing, consulting and professional services. Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of United States dollars in annual revenues. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. In addition to us, the largest publicly owned companies specializing in recruitment services are The Adecco Group and Randstad. We also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies such as Recruit Holdings, Allegis Group, Kelly Services, Robert Half, Kforce, PageGroup, Korn/Ferry International and Alexander Mann. It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the increasing demand for skilled people, employers’ desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including several of the employment services industry’s most recognized and respected brands; geographic diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and higher-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, and large national and multinational client relationships, which comprised approximately 60% of our revenues in 2022. Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses are based on a local or regional relationship, and tend to rely less on longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. The large national and multinational clients, on the other hand, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to local managers. As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed. 7 Legal Regulations The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us. In most countries, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, health and other benefits, anti-discrimination and workers’ compensation, govern the firm. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States, United Kingdom and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement. In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination. Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subject to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission’s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises. Changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which workforce solutions and services firms may operate. These changes could impose additional costs, taxes, record keeping or reporting requirements; restrict the tasks to which contingent workers may be assigned; limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the relationship (with us or the client); or otherwise adversely affect the industry. Trademarks We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries and territories. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup ® , Manpower ® , Experis ® , Right Management ® , Brook Street ® , Jefferson Wells ® , Supplay ® and MyPath ® have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. 8 Employees We had approximately 30,900 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we recruit millions of permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year on behalf of our clients. As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees. Human Capital We Are a Workforce Solutions and Human Capital Company. Human capital management is at the core of our business. Our purpose is to provide meaningful and sustainable employment and is rooted in our values: People, Knowledge and Innovation. Our 30,900 employees, spanning approximately 75 countries, help improve the lives of more than 500,000 workers daily by providing guidance, advice, assessments, coaching, upskilling, reskilling and pathways to long-term sustainable employment. These efforts support local economies by increasing employability and opportunity for the millions of lives that we reach each year. Through our ESG Plan, Working to Change the World, we work to address these challenges under our People & Prosperity pillar, with a focus on how we can become Creators of Talent at Scale and continue delivering on our purpose. For more than 70 years, we have developed global insights on the issues and trends impacting organizations and individuals in today’s fast changing world of work. Our own research and solutions, coupled with partnerships with clients and Non-Governmental Organizations (e.g. World Economic Forum, World Employment Confederation, Junior Achievement, World Business Council on Sustainable Development), are helping us advance the global discussion around current topics. These include the impact of digitization, shifting in-demand skills, exacerbating talent shortages, and the increased need for reskilling and upskilling. Our most recent annual Talent Shortage Survey reported that 75% of companies cannot find the skilled workers they need – the highest number in 16 years. We Seek to Create Talent at Scale Our Manpower MyPath program is designed to deliver targeted upskilling at speed and scale to our Manpower associates in order to accelerate their employability at higher wage levels, while also growing the pool of in-demand talent for our clients. Through this program, Manpower recruiters provide personalized and data-driven guidance, development, training, and access to jobs especially in growth sectors including advanced manufacturing, information technology, supply chain and customer service. MyPath has impacted over 200,000 lives through 2022, and MyPath associates now represent 38% of our associate talent pool, across nearly 13,000 clients and 15 markets. We are also targeting the creation of IT talent through our Experis Academy. This accelerated development program features custom-designed curricula to upskill people into specialized roles that can meet the demand for cloud, infrastructure, business transformation and digital workforces skills. Paired with coaching and soft skills training, upon completion most Academy graduates receive a permanent job offer from our clients. Through the end of 2022, we have graduated more than 1,700 developers while also bridging the skills gaps for more than 160 tech companies across 14 countries. 9 We Are Focused on Championing DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging), Strengthening Our Culture and Developing Our People Our Global Footprint We have a global footprint, though our teams are managed locally: 30% of our people are in the Americas, 31% in Southern Europe, 22% in Northern Europe and 17% in Asia Pacific/Middle East. Championing DEIB We believe that all people deserve to feel safe, respected and able to thrive in the workplace. Our focus on DEIB encompasses four goals: (1) globally, support gender diversity at leadership levels; (2) locally, address a second dimension of diversity based on gaps or opportunities within a country; (3) culturally, foster an inclusive environment that supports our diverse workforce; and (4) societally, advance employment security for workers while promoting upskilling, well-being, flexibility and income opportunity. We believe that diversity starts at the top. Our Board of Directors has exceeded 30% gender diversity for more than 10 years, is 17% racially diverse and 42% non-US born. Our Executive Leadership Team, which reports directly to the CEO, is 27% women, 36% racially diverse and 72% non-US born. Our Global Leadership Team, the top 95 leaders in the company, is 33% women. Our gender parity goal is 50% at the global leadership level by 2025. Gender diversity is our primary DEIB goal across all markets; in addition, our 17 largest markets have also established secondary diversity targets. These have been developed to reflect socio-economic challenges, cultural references and data privacy requirements specific to each of these countries. Examples include: First Nations representation in Australia, people with disabilities in Japan, young people in Mexico, LGBTQ+ in the Netherlands, age diversity in Spain, and racial and ethnic diversity in the US. Championing DEIB in our workplaces also means that we prioritize people’s health and wellbeing and have committed to flexible work models across the globe to attract, engage and retain our people. In a number of markets, we have launched initiatives and trained our managers to promote greater awareness of mental wellbeing. Developing our People We believe our success in creating value for individuals and organizations around the world will depend on our ability to leverage the potential of our own people. We are investing in our people to support both our strategic ambitions and their personal goals. In 2022, we continued to broaden and deepen our investment through our Leadership Development Programs, incorporating the 3 E’s of our development philosophy: Education, Exposure and Experience. Upon completion of these programs, the majority of our people have made positive leadership career moves. In 2022, we also increased our focus on learning through investment in the development of our Sales Academy, our Talent Agent program and our internal Experis Talent Academy while curating new online micro-courses for all employees. 10 Strengthening our Culture Listening to our people is key to supporting an inclusive and resilient culture. Through annual and regular pulse surveys we can understand employee sentiment around various items from the effectiveness of our people and culture strategy, to leadership, ethics and values and development opportunities. After launching our Culture Matters initiative in 2021, we continued our commitment to strengthening our employee engagement during 2022. Over the last two years, thousands of employees across 30 countries have completed more than 28,000 “sprints” and “drills”, experimenting with new cultural behaviors to begin building them into daily routines. We believe these efforts have enhanced employee engagement, as reflected in our ManpowerGroup Annual People Survey (MAPS) results. This survey, which had an 81% response rate in 2022, gives voice to our employees worldwide to share opinions, feedback, and opportunities for improvement. We have analyzed the results to identify actions we can take to strengthen our culture at the global and local levels. 11 Item 1A.

Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. Company and Operational Risks Strategic Risks 12 Financial and Market Risks Regulatory and Legal Risks Some or all of these factors may be beyond our control. We caution you that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. 13 Company and Operational Risks Our results of operations have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions, including the risk of recession. Our business is sensitive to changes in global macroeconomic conditions. We have at times experienced uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions, including in rates of growth or decline in the markets we serve. Our operating countries and regions, which are increasingly interdependent, have experienced periods of volatile growth patterns or declines, and we expect that global conditions will continue to be characterized by instability and unpredictability. Such conditions have and may continue to cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new projects that require our solutions which could decrease demand for our various staffing services. For example, the future economic impact of COVID-19 continues to be uncertain and unpredictable and global economic conditions, as well as our business, could be affected by the emergence of new variants, the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and governmental or individual actions in response to new COVID-19 developments. If our business growth is slow, or if it contracts for an extended period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. Based on current macroeconomic conditions, there is a significant risk that our most important markets will experience a recession, which would likely be accompanied by a decline in demand for our services. When demand drops or remains low, our operating profit is impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses do not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, some clients may slow the rate at which they pay us, or become unable to pay their obligations and our cash flow and profitability may suffer. Economic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, political volatility, civil violence and unrest, election results or other changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, trade disputes, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, social justice movements, energy shortages or instability in the global energy market, COVID-19 and other global health crises, changes in immigration policy, the impact of supply chain challenges on our clients, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, inflation, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. In addition, there is a risk the current inflationary environment could have an impact on the countries and territories where we do business. We are particularly susceptible to changes in demand patterns and economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and 64% of our revenue. There is a risk that economic conditions in European markets may continue to be negatively impacted by geopolitical events which, in recent years, have included labor unrest, civil protest, heightened trade tensions, refugee crises and, since early 2022, the Russia-Ukraine war. Numerous countries have instituted sanctions and other penalties against Russia. The measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by the U.S., European Union, and others could result in retaliatory action by the Russian government, leading to an escalation and/or expansion in the scope of this conflict. The consequences of this are difficult to predict but may result in further sanctions, regional or global instability, and geopolitical shifts, heightened cybersecurity threats, further disruptions in the global supply chain, volatility in foreign exchange rates, and inflationary pressures. In addition, the conflict may cause energy shortages, price increases, or other instability in the global energy market, particularly in Europe where our business may be especially vulnerable to these conditions. For example, during 2022 our operations in France had an outsized exposure to the Russia-Ukraine war due to the impact of supply chain constraints on demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily automotive and construction, and to a lesser degree, logistics. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, particularly our European operations. There is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated. 14 Even without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities. We may lack the speed, agility, and resiliency to effectively operate our business and respond to the needs of our clients. There is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our diverse clients, which span all industries and whose needs may change rapidly as their businesses and industries evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 30,900 employees based out of over 2,200 offices in approximately 75 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources, to maintain our corporate culture throughout the organization, to drive service improvements and to provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at anticipating or meeting the widely ranging needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to perform at speed, and to meet client expectations, may also be adversely affected by limitations in our own information systems and those of our third-party vendors. We are increasingly dependent on these systems, which are subject to damage or interruption from multiple causes, including power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, vandalism, malware, hacking and other malicious acts, catastrophic events and human error. If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly, or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience reputational damage, loss of critical information, customer disruption, and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry in many markets, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry in many markets, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. 15 We could incur liabilities or suffer reputational damage from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of personal or confidential data, and our use of data is subject to complex and ever-changing privacy and cybersecurity legal requirements that could negatively impact our business or subject us to claims and/or fines for non-compliance. In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment data, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is personal data and/or confidential data. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology systems and software, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including, but not limited to cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, use or loss of personal data and/or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, ransomware, systems failure, employee negligence or malfeasance, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy supply chain interruptions, social engineering attacks, viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks. An incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal and/or confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We regularly engage an independent external security firm to assess our defenses to a potential cyberattack, and these assessments may uncover new or additional vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a compromise of our systems and/or a loss of personal data. In a recent evaluation, vulnerabilities were identified that could facilitate or contribute to a security incident involving personal data. The assessment firm was able to penetrate defensive protections adopted by us, as well as protections that we obtain from third party providers. We are prioritizing the resolution of security gaps that could lead to a loss of personal data or to other damage. Despite our efforts to identify and address vulnerabilities in our systems, vulnerabilities in software products used by us are disclosed by our software providers on a daily basis, and attackers grow continuously more sophisticated in their attack methods, making it impossible to give assurance that our cybersecurity efforts will be successful. There is a risk that our and our third-party vendors’ preventative security controls and practices will be inadequate to prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, or fraudulent activity, especially given that third party attacks have become more common. In the past, our data has been exposed due to data security breaches at our third party vendors, but to date none of these incidents have had a material impact on our operations or financial results. Any such future events, such as unauthorized access or fraudulent activity with our third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more of our employees are working from their homes or other remote locations which makes it more difficult for us to monitor their activities, the security of their work locations, insider threats, and data exfiltration. This has increased the risk of security incidents, which could include unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, as well as other types of fraudulent activity. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 16 The potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the potential for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and cybersecurity are subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the EU Court of Justice’s opinion in the “Schrems II” decision (which invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), as well as additional legislation in place, or expected to become effective, in various U.S. states and other countries. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, the GDPR and the CPRA impose significant compliance obligations that add costs and operational burdens to our business with respect to our collection, use, storage and retention of personal data. Compliance with these obligations could reduce operational efficiency and increase our regulatory compliance costs, and failure to satisfy these requirements may lead to significant regulatory enforcement actions and/or large private litigation in the event of a security breach or other violation. Under the GDPR, the maximum fine can be up to 4% of a company’s global revenue, and there is no maximum penalty under the CPRA. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims and losses related to violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws or security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach. We have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption, increased costs, and reputational risk. We have increasingly outsourced, and may further outsource, important processes of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs, supply chain interruptions, potential disruptions to our business operations, and reputational risk. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide important back-office support. We have increasingly centralized our vendor profile so that we are reliant on a small number of vendors for highly critical corporate and technology functions. While we believe these third-party vendors provide greater efficiency and expertise, our dependence on a small number of vendors increases the risk that our business will be adversely affected if our vendors are unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Similarly, our business continuity and our margins could be adversely affected if we needed to replace one of our critical vendors for performance or economic reasons. Our operations also depend significantly upon these vendors’ and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third-party vendors’ implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. Our vendors have experienced data losses in the past, and we can expect such data incidents will occur in the future. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems, or those of our vendors, could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations, any of which could damage our reputation in the market. If we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. A loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business. 17 If we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer. Our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations. Intense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients’ staffing needs. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who meet the requirements of our clients and possess skill sets and experience that match client needs. In many markets, we have recently experienced an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. These labor shortages have been exacerbated by employees and potential employees leaving the labor market due to burn-out, resignation, early retirement, immigration challenges, workplace safety concerns, vaccine mandates, and childcare responsibilities. Workers have also impacted the labor market through increasing demands for change in employment conditions, such as demands for higher wages, remote work, and additional flexibility in work schedule. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. This is especially acute for individuals with critical IT capabilities and other technology skills that are in high demand by many companies, as competition for such individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel with relevant skills may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations’ workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with skills that match client demand, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Our global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control. With operations in approximately 75 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, the impact of global climate change, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics, including COVID-19, and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities including energy, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results. 18 Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. We believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services. From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights and may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or changes in law that diminish or remove our current legal protections could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. 19 Strategic Risks We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives. Our business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services. This includes expanding our sales in higher margin professional resourcing, such as our Experis brand in IT recruitment. There is a risk that our growth strategy in Experis may be impeded due to the scarcity of talent in the IT field, which is particularly in demand, and which may restrict our ability to fulfill customer requirements. Similarly, another aspect of our strategy to expand beyond our core staffing and employment services is through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. Our higher-margin Right Management career management services have historically performed well in periods of downturn, and it is part of our business strategy that this counter-cyclical effect would help cushion our results in the event of a future period of decline. However, in the event of a downturn, there can be no assurances that the margin contribution from Right Management would increase, or that it would significantly offset other declines we might experience in the business. Additionally, our workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client’s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions. Our business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes and regulatory restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant rapid disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 20 Our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments and disclosures may expose us to risks and legal liability. Our business could be impacted in several ways by our corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, including our goals for sustainability, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful and may introduce unexpected costs. From time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets, including, in 2021, a significant acquisition of ettain group. These activities involve significant strategic and operational risks, including: These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. The integration of prior acquisitions, as well as entry into future acquisition transactions, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We could also incur impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges as a result of acquisitions we make. 21 From time to time, we undertake dispositions via sales, franchises, joint ventures or other exit activities, and we may face risks related to such transactions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations in order to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. We have engaged in such dispositions in the past, including our dispositions of our businesses in Russia in January 2022, and in Hungary in December 2022, and we expect that we will continue to dispose of portions of our business that are not meeting our performance or strategic objectives. Among other alternatives, this could take the form of a closure of a business, the contribution of the business to a joint venture, or an exit by means of a sale to, or a franchise arrangement with, a third party. There are risks and costs associated with any exit activities, which could include difficulties in the separation of operations, services or personnel, the diversion of management attention, and the disruption of our business. Any such transactions may require regulatory or governmental approvals, which could impede the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in, or liability with respect to, the divested businesses. As a result of divestiture transactions, we could incur severance charges for personnel and payments for lease and other commitments, charges from the impairment or write-off of assets, and other financial loss due to the transaction. Furthermore, there is the risk that we might lose customers, in particular multinational clients with operations in the exited countries or operations. Additionally, if we choose to enter into a franchise arrangement for a third party to operate our business in the exited region using our trademarks and other licensed assets, we face potential counterparty and reputational risks arising from the franchisee’s operation of the business. The reputational risks include the risk that marketplace participants, including clients, candidates and the media, may believe that we continue to control the operations of a divested or franchised business that operates utilizing our name or other trademarks. Financial and Market Risks Foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results. During 2022, approximately 82% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $986.5 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2022, was denominated in foreign currencies, including $956.6 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported results and shareholders’ equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses unless we repatriate funds. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult. We seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps. Our Euro-denominated notes are designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2022, to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective. 22 Our liquidity could be adversely impacted by economic conditions affecting our clients. Our working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a focus on Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase, and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer. Our results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected. Our debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2022, we had $986.5 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following: Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. The lenders under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, or our interest expense may increase substantially. 23 Furthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries, or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected. The performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries. Since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances. Our inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries. In a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business. In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may disagree in the future, with our judgments. Many taxing authorities are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, recently agreed to enact Pillar Two, which introduces a global minimum effective tax rate whereby certain multinational groups are subject to a 15% minimum tax on income derived in low-tax jurisdictions. These rules are to become effective beginning in 2024. In the United States, various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered including the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act, which introduced a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax beginning in 2023. These proposed and enacted changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse impact on our current or future tax positions. 24 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors. The market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2022, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $115.54 to a low of $64.00. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these “Risk Factors” and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: Regulatory and Legal Risks Our performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments. Our contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties or subcontractors to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our clients have become more sophisticated in their contractual negotiation process and more detailed in defining their operational requirements, including requirements to use the client's form of agreement. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners’ ability to meet our clients’ delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability. Additionally, we may incur liability for the actions or omissions of our partners, subcontractors or vendors and we may face challenges or be unable to enforce these obligations against those partners. Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Mexico, the employment services industry is heavily regulated and scrutinized. For example, in April 2021, new legislation was adopted in Mexico that affects many types of temporary placements under the country’s labor laws. The new law broadly prohibits the provision of our traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for special, deliverables-based projects outside of the client’s core business activity. This has had a material adverse impact on our business in Mexico. In Europe, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Moreover, many countries, including the Netherlands and Japan, have established regulations that require equal-pay for equal-work for temporary workers and fixed term employees. Furthermore, some countries are adopting more restrictive immigration regulations, which may lead to greater expense or inability to fulfill client demand, particularly in our cross-border talent solutions business. All of these continuously-evolving regulations could have a significant impact to our revenues, costs, and operating margins as we and customers adjust to these new regulations. The countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: 25 Other types of future regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results by making it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to cost-effectively provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients. Failure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business. We are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our temporary associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business. We may be exposed to legal claims, including employment-related claims that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide variety of potential litigation and other legal claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some, or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us. For example, through our direct interaction with our clients’ businesses and facilities, including functions and systems that are sensitive or critical to their core businesses, we may be exposed to operational, regulatory, reputational and other risks specific to their business, including data security risks. These risks may be reduced through contractual provisions that limit damages or mitigate our responsibility for losses caused by our assigned workers; but these types of contractual protections are not always possible because we may perceive an important economic opportunity, because of the contracting practices of our industry competitors or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities could include possible claims of or relating to: 26 We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to the above risks. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business regardless of the merits of the claim. For example, in the past, we have devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based “wage and hour” claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we are often sued by plaintiffs in various other employment-related matters, including those seeking class action status in the US. It is likely we will continue to experience similar claims in the future, which may increase in number as a result of remote working assignments as well as increasing employment regulation at the state and local level. We cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our business exposes us to competition law risk. We are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate. Competition law authorities have investigated our business practices in the past in France and in other countries, and there continues to be a risk of such inquiries in the future. There is no assurance we would successfully defend against any such regulatory inquiries, and they could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome could result in liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult. Certain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include: In addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin’s “fair price” and “business combination” provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline. 27 Item 1B. Unresolve d Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2.

[Reserved] 32 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Measures — Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included in the Financial Measures section found in Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" Results of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 The financial discussion that follows focuses on 2022 results compared to 2021. For a discussion of 2021 results compared to 2020, see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 . During 2022, revenues decreased -4.3% in 2022 compared to 2021. Our 2022 results reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased demand for our services in most of our key markets. However, we also believe that downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased significantly in Europe and North America. This economic risk is particularly high in Europe, driven by elevated inflation, rising energy prices, the Russia-Ukraine war and higher interest rates. Within Europe, Germany's industrial economy is especially sensitive to increases in energy costs, which could impact other countries given the importance of the German economy. Our France operation has an outsized exposure to the Russia-Ukraine war due to the impact of supply chain constraints on demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily automotive and construction, and to a lesser degree, logistics. As Europe represents a significant portion of our operations, we continue to monitor economic conditions in our Southern Europe and Northern Europe regions. During 2022, the United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in our European markets, which therefore had an unfavorable impact on our reported results. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a -9.2% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.88 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in 2022. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same local currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. 33 During 2022, we experienced the following quarterly changes to our consolidated revenues compared to 2021: a 4.4% increase in revenue in the first quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates; a revenue decrease of -3.8% in the second quarter due to the significant strengthening of the dollar causing an unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and slightly more billing days; -6.6% decrease in revenues in the third quarter due to the continued unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our staffing/interim services in key markets and the impact of acquisitions; and ending the year with a -10.6% revenue decrease in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflecting a deteriorating economic environment during the quarter, particularly across Europe and North America, and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. During 2022 compared to 2021, most of our markets experienced revenue decreases due to the strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by strong labor markets and continued solid demand. We experienced a -8.7% revenue decrease in Southern Europe, mainly driven by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, offset by increased demand in France and Italy. We experienced a -13.3% revenue decrease in Northern Europe primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand in our permanent recruitment business. Revenues increased 15.8% in the Americas primarily driven by our acquisition of the ettain group in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021, which now operates as part of our Experis brand, increased demand for our staffing/interim services and increased demand for our permanent recruitment business. We refer to the ettain group acquisition as the ""Experis acquisition"". We experienced a -3.8% revenue decrease in APME primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. From a brand perspective, we experienced a revenue decrease in Manpower, and revenue increases in Experis and Talent Solutions during 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue decrease in our Manpower brand was due to the unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by increased demand for staffing services and solid demand in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the Experis acquisition in the United States, improved demand for our interim services and increased demand in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our RPO services as the permanent recruitment environment was strong during the year. Our gross profit margin improved in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix as our higher-margin permanent recruitment business, which experienced a 22.5% increase (32.3% in constant currency and 31.0% in organic constant currency) during 2022 as a result of stronger hiring activity, represented a higher percentage of the revenue mix in our largest markets. The increase was also due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margin in all of our major markets, margin improvement in our Experis managed services business in Europe, and a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin consulting and MSP services. These increases were partially offset by a lower mix of revenues coming from our higher-margin Right Management career transition business. We recorded a $50.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Netherlands reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2022. We recorded restructuring costs of $3.6 million in 2022, compared to $15.2 million in 2021. We recorded integration costs of $14.7 million in 2022 relating to our Experis acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to Experis acquisition and integration costs of $18.8 million in 2021. We recorded a net loss on the sale of our Russia business of $8.0 million, which was comprised of a $9.7 million loss in selling and administrative expenses, offset by a $1.7 million gain in interest and other expenses representing a cumulative translation adjustment. We recorded a net loss on the sale of our Hungary business of $2.0 million, which was comprised of a $0.8 million loss in selling and administrative expenses and a $1.2 million loss in interest and other expenses representing cumulative translation adjustments. We also recognized a one-time gain of $10.0 million related to a long-term obligation in Northern Europe in 2021. 34 Our operating profit decreased -0.6% in 2022 while our operating profit margin increased 10 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, a goodwill impairment charge incurred in 2022 related to our Netherlands reporting unit, a loss from the disposition of subsidiaries incurred in 2022, the one-time gain related to a Northern Europe long-term obligation in 2021, restructuring costs incurred in 2022 and 2021, and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2022 and 2021, our operating profit was up 20.8%. Excluding the impact of the items previously listed, our operating profit margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2021. The operating profit margin increased mostly due to the improvement in our gross profit margin and our ability to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. Consolidated Results - 2022 compared to 2021 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2022 as compared to 2021. (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Reported Variance Variance in Constant Currency Variance in Organic Constant Currency Revenues from services $ 19,827.5 $ 20,724.4 (4.3 )% 4.9 % 2.6 % Cost of services 16,255.1 17,316.9 (6.1 ) 3.1 Gross profit 3,572.4 3,407.5 4.8 13.8 9.8 Gross profit margin 18.0 % 16.4 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 2,940.7 2,822.1 4.2 12.4 Goodwill impairment charges 50.0 — Selling and administrative expenses 2,990.7 2,822.1 6.0 14.3 10.9 Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues 15.1 % 13.6 % Operating profit 581.7 585.4 (0.6 ) 11.7 4.6 Operating profit margin 2.9 % 2.8 % Net interest expense 29.0 26.8 Other expenses (income), net (4.4 ) (9.5 ) Earnings before income taxes 557.1 568.1 (1.9 ) 10.2 Provision for income taxes 183.3 185.7 (1.3 ) Effective income tax rate 32.9 % 32.7 % Net earnings $ 373.8 $ 382.4 (2.2 ) 9.9 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 7.08 $ 6.91 2.6 15.3 Weighted average shares - diluted 52.8 55.4 (4.7 )% 35 The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -4.3% (increase of 4.9% in constant currency and 2.6% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: The year-over-year 160 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 6.0% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022 (14.3% in constant currency; 10.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: 36 Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 150 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to: Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $24.6 million in 2022 compared to $17.3 million in 2021. Net interest expense increased $8.1 million in 2022 to $46.9 million from $38.8 million in 2021 primarily due to the higher interest rate on our €400.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2022 compared to the interest rate on the €400.0 million notes due September 2022 that were repaid in July 2022. Miscellaneous income was $16.3 million in 2022 compared to miscellaneous expense of $14.7 million in 2021. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.9% for 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 32.7% for 2021. The 2022 rate was higher than the 2021 rate due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in the Netherlands. This was partially offset by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25%. The 32.9% effective tax rate for 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, the Netherlands non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $7.08 in 2022 compared to $6.91 in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.88 per share in 2022. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in 2022 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $0.93. The acquisition transaction and integration costs recorded in 2022 and 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.22 and $0.27, net of tax, in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries recorded in 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.19 per share, net of tax, in 2022 . Restructuring costs recorded in 2022 and 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.05 and $0.07 per share, net of tax, in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The pension settlement expense recorded in 2022 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $0.05, net of tax, in 2022. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 52.8 million in 2022 from 55.4 million in 2021. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2021 and 2022 and the full year weighting of the repurchases completed in 2021, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since 2021. Segment Results We evaluate performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 37 Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 15.8% (18.1% in constant currency and 4.5% in organic constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021. In the United States, revenues from services increased 27.6% (6.5% on an organic basis) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis staffing/interim services including the significant contribution to revenues from our Experis acquisition and increased demand in our permanent recruitment business of 41.6% (34.3% on an organic basis). In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased -5.5% (increase of 0.9% in constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand in our permanent recruitment business of 41.5% (47.3% in constant currency). This decline was driven by a decrease in Mexico of -46.9% (-47.4% in constant currency) primarily due to labor legislation implemented in the third quarter of 2021.The decline was partially offset by increases in Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 3.4%, 21.9%, 3.9%, 5.2% and 8.1%, respectively (7.2%, 64.5%, 17.5%, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, in constant currency), with the increase in Argentina being primarily due to inflation. Gross profit margin increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the increased demand in our permanent recruitment business, improvement in the staffing/interim margin, the Experis acquisition and increases in revenues from our higher-margin professional staffing and Talent Solutions offerings in the United States. In 2022, selling and administrative expenses increased 20.3% (21.4% in constant currency and 11.5% in organic constant currency) primarily due to the Experis acquisition and an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount as we invested in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to $1.0 million in 2022 compared to $5.2 million in 2021, and a decrease in Experis acquisition and integration costs of $14.7 million in 2022 compared to Experis acquisition and integration costs of $18.8 million in 2021. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 5.7% and 4.6% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 6.3% in 2022 from 5.0% in 2021 primarily due to increased demand in our permanent recruitment business, the Experis acquisition, increased operating leverage, an increase in the gross profit margin due to a favorable business mix and a decrease in Experis acquisition and integration costs incurred in 2022 compared to 2021, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.4% in 2022 from 3.9% in 2021 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement and a decrease in restructuring costs. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased -8.7% (increase of 2.0% in constant currency and 1.7% in organic constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021. In 2022, revenues from services decreased -7.5% (increase of 4.0% in constant currency and 3.6% in organic constant currency) in France and decreased -4.9% (increase of 6.8% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints have negatively impacted the demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily automotive and construction, and to a lesser degree, logistics. The decrease was also offset by an 8.2% increase (21.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and Experis interim services and a 12.4% increase (26.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -14.1% (-6.2% in constant currency and -6.2% in organic constant currency) during 2022 compared to 2021, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis business services and increased demand in our permanent recruitment business of 19.4% (33.4% in constant currency and 33.4% in organic constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to the increased demand in our permanent recruitment business and increases in our staffing/interim margin across our key markets. 38 Selling and administrative expenses decreased -4.0% (increase of 7.1% in constant currency) during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the period and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. The decreases were also partially offset by the increase in restructuring costs to $0.9 million in 2022 from zero in 2021. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.8% for 2022 compared to 4.5% for 2021. In France, the OUP margin increased to 4.7% for 2022 from 4.5% in 2021 primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.2% for 2022 from 6.4% for 2021 primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 3.1% in 2022 from 2.8% in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 37%, 24%, 13%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -13.3% (-2.5% in constant currency and 0.0% in organic constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium of -13.9%, -5.1%, -18.0%, -15.7% and -8.8%, respectively (-4.3%, +8.6%, -8.0%, -5.5% and +2.6%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decreases in Northern Europe were primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the decreased demand for our staffing/interim services, partially offset by the 22.0% increase (37.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. Gross profit margin increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the increases in staffing/interim margin, the increased demand in our permanent recruitment business and the underlying business mix. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -1.1% (increase of 11.3% in constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 1.0% in 2022 from 1.5% in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the loss on the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by the increase in gross profit margin. APME Revenues from services decreased -3.8% (increase 9.0% in constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021. In Japan (which represents 46% of APME's revenues), revenues from services decreased -6.1% (increase of 12.0% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Experis business and an increased demand for our Manpower staffing services. In Australia (which represents 12% of APME's revenues), revenues from services decreased -13.7% (-6.7% in constant currency) primarily due to the exit of a low margin client arrangement in 2021 and the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our staffing/interim business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to the increase in demand for our staffing/interim business and our Experis business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the increases in our staffing/interim margin and the increased demand in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -2.7% (increase of 9.6% in constant currency) in 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support increases in revenues, increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. OUP margin increased to 3.7% in 2022 from 3.4% in 2021 primarily due to the improvements in the gross profit margin. 39 Financial Measures Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Certain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP percent variances to the percent variances calculated based on our annual GAAP financial results is provided below.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2022, we had $554.3 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund corporate activities. As of December 31, 2022, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,277.8 million of accumulated unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $18.4 million and $16.1 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. As of December 31, 2022, we had an additional $339.9 million of accumulated unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes as amounts are deemed indefinitely reinvested. We have not estimated the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine or immaterial to the financial statements. Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate. Cash provided by operating activities was $423.3 million, $644.8 million and $936.4 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $139.7 million, compared to $135.6 million and $703.6 million of cash generated in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in 2022 from 2021 was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing. The change in 2021 from 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the stronger market environment as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis had stabilized in many parts of the world by 2021, offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing. In 2021, these improvements in our cash flows were partially offset by the decrease in our payroll-related liabilities due to lower activity. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,137.4 million as of December 31, 2022 from $5,448.2 million as of December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. DSO increased by one day from December 31, 2021 to 56 days as of December 31, 2022 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. Capital expenditures were $75.6 million, $64.2 million and $50.7 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenditures were comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $34.2 million, $26.9 million and $14.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The year-over-year increases in expenditures were primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. Net debt repayments were $58.7 million in 2022 as compared to net borrowings of $70.3 million in 2021 and net debt payments of $38.5 million in 2020. The change in 2022 from 2021 is mainly due to the $75.0 million repayment we made into our revolving credit facility during 2022 to clear the outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2021 related to the Experis acquisition. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand and a $150.0 million draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million, 6.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock in August 2021, August 2019 and August 2018. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2022, we repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 2.0 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $270.0 million. In 2021, we repurchased 2.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a total cost of $210.0 million. In 2020, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $264.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, there were 2.0 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 or 2018 authorization. 41 During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $2.72, $2.52 and $2.26 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $139.9 million, $136.6 million and $129.1 million, respectively. We have aggregate commitments of $1,961.2 million related to debt, operating leases, restructuring costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows: (in millions) Total 2023 2024-2025 2026-2027 Thereafter Long-term debt including interest $ 1,081.7 $ 9.4 $ 48.7 $ 1,008.6 $ 15.0 Short-term borrowings 26.6 26.6 — — — Operating leases 383.4 113.9 136.8 69.1 63.6 Restructuring costs 13.2 8.8 3.1 1.3 — Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act 89.3 22.3 67.0 — — Other 367.0 183.4 107.5 31.2 44.9 $ 1,961.2 $ 364.4 $ 363.1 $ 1,110.2 $ 123.5 Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $59.1 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled. We recorded net restructuring costs of $3.6 million, $15.2 million and $110.7 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid out of our restructuring reserve were $13.7 million during 2022. We have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $840.2 million as of December 31, 2022 ($793.0 million for guarantees and $47.2 million for stand-by letters of credit). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.7 million for 2022. Total capitalization as of December 31, 2022 was $3,444.6 million, comprised of $986.5 million in debt and $2,458.1 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 29%, 31% and 31% as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Acquisitions On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $930.9 million. Of the total consideration paid, $925.0 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $5.9 million was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $150.0 million draw on our revolving debt facility on October 1, 2021. We finalized the purchase accounting during the third quarter of 2022 and recognized post-closing working capital adjustments of $3.4 million and income tax adjustments of $3.1 million with a corresponding offset to goodwill. 42 The acquisition of ettain group was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of ettain group were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The customer relationship intangible asset is amortized over a 15-year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $330.0 million and $513.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $354.0 million and $519.6 million, respectively. The $6.5 million decrease in goodwill during 2022 resulted from the post-closing working capital adjustments discussed above. The goodwill is included within the United States reporting unit and is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies to occur post-acquisition as a result of diversifying the business into higher growth and higher value services. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding ettain group, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $20.2 million, $8.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The 2022 payments primarily represent a consideration payment for the acquisition of Tingari, a talent solutions company in France. The 2022, 2021 and 2020 balances include consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $3.8 million, $6.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2022, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2022 acquisitions were $8.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2021 acquisitions, excluding ettain group, were $3.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. No goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in 2020. Dispositions Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $3.2 million. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $8.0 million, of which $9.7 million was included in selling and administrative expenses and a gain of $1.7 million was included in interest and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. On September 30, 2022, our Belgium business disposed of its Service Voucher Division and recognized a one-time gain of $4.1 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 15, 2022, we disposed of our Hungary business in our Southern Europe segment and recognized a one-time loss of $2.1 million, of which $0.9 million was included in selling and administrative expenses and $1.2 million was included in interest and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2021, we disposed of our Tunisia business in our Southern Europe segment and recognized a one-time loss of $1.2 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 30, 2020, we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $5.8 million, subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $5.8 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2020. Euro Notes On June 30, 2022, we offered and sold €400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.50% notes due June 30, 2027 (the “€400.0 million notes”). The proceeds from the €400.0 million notes were used in July 2022 to repay our €400.0 million 1.875% notes due September 11, 2022. The €400.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.465% to yield an effective interest rate of 3.514%, net of a favorable impact of a forward starting interest rate swap. Interest on the €400.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 30 of each year. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 2026 (the “€500.0 million notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 million notes of €495.7 million were used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the €500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. 43 Both the €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2022. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement On May 27, 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of May 27, 2027 to replace our previous $600.0 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes terms generally consistent with our previous 5-year credit facility, except the Credit Agreement uses Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base rate index instead of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of December 31, 2022 and $75.0 million as of December 31, 2021 under the previous facility. Outstanding letters of credit issued totaled $0.4 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additional borrowings of $599.6 million and $524.5 million were available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 10 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 102.5 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our interest and facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.5 million annually. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. In the Credit Agreement, Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash in excess of $400.0 million. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgements, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. As defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.01 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5.66 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2022. Other In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2022, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $318.4 million, of which $288.5 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $270.1 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2021. 44 Our long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance. Assessment of the Liquidity Position We have assessed our liquidity position as of December 31, 2022 and for the near future. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $639.0 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, less any outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $270.1 million was available to use as of December 31, 2022. Our €500.0 ($532.7) million notes mature in June 2026, and our €400.0 ($423.9) million notes mature in June 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Business Combinations Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). As part of the accounting for the acquisition, we identified and recorded a customer relationship intangible asset of $360.0 million which is amortized over a 15 year useful life. We utilized the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the customer relationship asset, which required management to make significant assumptions in the model, but was calculated based on the historical customer sales of the acquired company. A change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a decrease of $66.0 million or an increase of $87.0 million in intangible assets, respectively, but would not result in a material change to future amortization expense. 45 Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $18.6, $22.2 million and $34.1 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in 2021 pension expense from 2020 was primarily due to the settlement of a U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2020. Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $15.0 million in 2023. The calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact annual expense recorded related to the plans. In determining the estimated 2023 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 3.2% compared to 1.0% for 2022, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 3.5% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2023 estimated pension expense compared to 2.2% used for the calculation of the 2022 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would decrease or increase our 2023 consolidated pension expense by $0.6 million. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our 2023 consolidated pension expense by $1.3 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) 46 Income Taxes The accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not exceed the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements. We provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year. Goodwill Impairment We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2022 and determined that there was no impairment. The table below provides estimated fair values and carrying values for our reporting units with the largest goodwill balances, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 85% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2022 (measurement date of July 1, 2022). (in millions) United States France United Kingdom Canada Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 2,650.4 $ 2,372.2 $ 359.0 $ 240.7 $ 115.1 Carrying values 1,758.5 841.4 249.9 127.1 115.0 The fair value of each reporting unit at the time of our annual impairment test was at least 20% in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that approximated its carrying value. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2022 included a discount rate of 12.5%, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 3.0% to 8.4%, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0%, and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0%. During the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. Since the assessment conducted in the third quarter of 2022, we identified several factors related to our Netherlands reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount which triggered us to perform an interim impairment assessment. These factors included further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions, including downward revisions to projected Netherlands economic expansion in 2023, an increasing interest rate environment and financial performance that came in below management's planned revenue and OUP expectations for the fourth quarter of 2022. 47 During the fourth quarter of 2022, we wrote the carrying value of the Netherlands reporting unit down to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $50.0 million. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 included a discount rate of 13.5%, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 0.0% to 3.0%, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0%, and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0%. Management continues to closely monitor the results of the reporting unit and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. The performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the Netherlands reporting unit. If the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, or if there is continued deterioration in the market due to macroeconomic conditions, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $55.1 million as of December 31, 2022, could be subject to further impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20% or more of their respective carrying values, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations Market Risks We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Exchange Rates Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries and our Euro-denominated borrowings. For our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rates impact the United States dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in the subsidiaries and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries. Approximately 82% of our revenues and profits are generated outside of the United States, with 44% generated from our European operations with a Euro-functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, particularly the Euro, may have a significant impact on our reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates each month. Consequently, as the value of the United States dollar changes relative to the currencies of our major markets, our reported results vary. The United States dollar generally strengthened against the currencies of our major markets during 2022, whereas it weakened in 2021 on average. Revenues from services in constant currency were 9.2% higher than reported revenues in 2022 and 3.0% lower than reported revenues in 2021. A change in the strength of the United States dollar by an additional 10% would have impacted our revenues from services by approximately 8.2% and 8.7% from the amounts reported in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the United States dollar amount of our shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of our non-United States subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Consequently, shareholders’ equity decreased by $116.3 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2022. If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2022, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have decreased by approximately $170.0 million from the amounts reported. As of December 31, 2021, the United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies compared to December 31, 2020, particularly in Euro- and GBP-functional currencies. Consequently, shareholders’ equity decreased by $46.9 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2021. If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2021, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have decreased by approximately $80.0 million from the amounts reported. Although currency fluctuations impact our reported results and shareholders’ equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. We generally have few cross-border transfers of funds, except for transfers to the United States for payment of intercompany franchise fees and interest expense on intercompany loans, working capital loans made between the United States and our foreign subsidiaries, dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, and payments between certain countries and territories for services provided. To reduce the currency risk related to these transactions, we may borrow funds in the relevant foreign currency under our revolving credit agreement or we may enter into a forward contract to hedge the transfer. 49 As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding $956.6 million in principal amount of Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2022. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ equity increased by $46.6 million, net of tax, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2022, due to the currency impact on these designated borrowings. The hypothetical impact of the stated change in rates on 2022 total other comprehensive income (loss) for the Euro Notes and forward contracts is as follows: 2022 (in millions) Market Sensitive Instrument 10% Depreciation in Exchange Rates 10% Appreciation in Exchange Rates Euro Notes: €500.0, 1.81% Notes due June 2026 $ 53.5 $ (53.5 ) €400.0, 3.50% Notes due June 2027 42.8 (42.8 ) Forward contracts: €(73.0) to $(78.1) 7.8 (7.8 ) ¥271.0 to $2.1 (0.2 ) 0.2 Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2022, we had the following fixed- and variable-rate borrowings: (in millions) Amount Weighted- Average Interest Rate (1) Variable-rate borrowings $ 21.5 6.1 % Fixed-rate borrowings 965.0 2.6 % Total debt $ 986.5 (1) The rates are impacted by currency exchange rate movements. Impact of Economic Conditions One of the principal attractions of using workforce solutions and service providers is to maintain a flexible supply of labor to meet changing economic conditions. Therefore, the industry has been and remains sensitive to economic cycles. To help minimize the effects of these economic cycles, we offer clients a continuum of services to meet their needs throughout the business cycle. We believe that the breadth of our operations and the diversity of our service mix cushion us against the impact of an adverse economic cycle in any single country or industry. However, adverse economic conditions in any of our largest markets, or in several markets simultaneously, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 17, 2023 52 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of ManpowerGroup Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill - Netherlands Reporting Unit – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The annual impairment test of goodwill at a reporting unit level is performed annually as of July 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its respective carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. 53 Following the July 1 annual impairment test of goodwill, the Netherlands reporting unit’s fair value approximated it’s carrying value. Given the fair value approximated the carrying value of this reporting unit, the performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the economic environment introduced a heightened risk for impairment following the July 1 assessment. During the fourth quarter of 2022 the company identified factors that caused it to evaluate the goodwill associated with the Netherlands reporting unit for potential impairment. These factors included operating results that were below management targets and deterioration of the macroeconomic and local market conditions since the time of management’s annual assessment. The Company updated its fair value estimate as of December 31, 2022 to reflect current market conditions and as a result of the test recorded a $50.0 million impairment of goodwill based on the excess of the Netherlands reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining goodwill balance for the Netherlands reporting unit was $55.1 million. Given that forecasted revenues and operating unit profit margins for the Netherlands reporting unit are highly sensitive to changes in demand and efficiency of operations, and considering the breakeven excess of fair value over carrying value of this reporting unit, auditing these estimates and assumptions including the selected discount rates and long-term growth rates, and auditing the appropriateness of the impairment charge, involved especially subjective judgment. As a result, we identified the Company’s evaluation of goodwill impairment for the Netherlands reporting unit as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment and the increased extent of effort that was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s significant estimates and assumptions, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins, and the selection of discount rates and long-term revenue growth rates for the Netherlands reporting unit included the following, among others: /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 17, 2023 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005. 54 CONSOLIDATED STATEM ENTS OF OPERATIONS in millions, except per share data Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Revenues from services $ 19,827.5 $ 20,724.4 $ 18,001.0 Cost of services 16,255.1 17,316.9 15,176.3 Gross profit 3,572.4 3,407.5 2,824.7 Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 2,940.7 2,822.1 2,570.3 Goodwill impairment charges 50.0 — 66.8 Selling and administrative expenses 2,990.7 2,822.1 2,637.1 Operating profit 581.7 585.4 187.6 Interest and other expenses, net 24.6 17.3 39.9 Earnings before income taxes 557.1 568.1 147.7 Provision for income taxes 183.3 185.7 123.9 Net earnings $ 373.8 $ 382.4 $ 23.8 Net earnings per share - basic $ 7.17 $ 7.01 $ 0.41 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 7.08 $ 6.91 $ 0.41 Weighted average shares - basic 52.2 54.5 58.0 Weighted average shares - diluted 52.8 55.4 58.3 The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

share and per share data Nature of Operations ManpowerGroup Inc. is a world leader in the innovative workforce solutions and services industry. Our global network of over 2,200 offices in approximately 75 countries and territories allows us to meet the needs of our global, multinational and local clients across all major industry segments. Our largest operations, based on revenues, are located in France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. We specialize in permanent, temporary and contract recruitment and assessment; training and development; outsourcing; career management and workforce consulting services. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include our operating results and the operating results of all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and the noncontrolling shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, or we have significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for equity investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our ownership share of earnings of these equity method investments, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments, as well as certain other relationships, are also evaluated for consolidation under the accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. These investments were $ 95.8 and $ 114.2 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are $ 4.3 and $ 11.8 , respectively, of accumulated unremitted earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method. The amounts relate to accounting for our remaining interest in ManpowerGroup Greater China under the equity method subsequent to deconsolidation in 2019. Revenues We recognize revenues when control of the promised services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of any sales, value added or other taxes collected from our clients. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service to the client, and it is the unit of account in the accounting guidance for revenue recognition. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in our contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. However, we have multiple performance obligations within our Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) contracts as discussed below. For performance obligations that we satisfy over time, revenues are recognized by consistently applying a method of measuring progress toward satisfaction of that performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time (e.g., hours, weeks, months) of service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of each performance obligation. 59 We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices included in the client contracts, using expected costs plus margin or other observable prices. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Certain client contracts have variable consideration, including credits, sales allowances, rebates or other similar items that generally reduce the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration using whichever method, either the expected value method or most likely amount method, better predicts the amount of consideration to which we will become entitled based on the terms of the client contract and historical evidence. These amounts may be constrained and are only included in revenues to the extent we do not expect a significant reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our variable consideration amounts are not material, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates. Our client contracts generally include standard payment terms acceptable in each of the countries and territories in which we operate. The payment terms vary by the type and location of our clients and services offered. Client payments are typically due approximately 60 days after invoicing but may be a shorter or longer term depending on the contract. Our client contracts are generally short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. The timing between satisfaction of the performance obligation, invoicing and payment is not significant. For certain services and client types, we may require payment prior to delivery of services to the client, for which deferred revenue is recorded. In certain scenarios where a third-party vendor is involved in our revenue transactions with our clients, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent in the transaction. In situations where we act as principal in the transaction, we control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as gross revenues and cost of services. When we act as agent in the transaction, we do not control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as revenues on a net basis. A majority of these agent transactions occur within our TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) programs where our performance obligation is to manage our client’s contingent workforce, and we earn a commission based on the amount of staffing services that are managed through the program. We are the agent in these transactions as we do not control the third-party providers' staffing services provided to the client through our MSP program prior to those services being transferred to the client. For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. As allowed under the guidance, we do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to December 31, 2022 related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 35.6 and $ 34.8 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recognized the entire amount of the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 . We expect to recognize the entire amount of deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 as revenue in 2023. 60 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration for historical write-off experience, the current aging of receivables, market conditions and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. Balance at Beginning of Year Provisions Charged to Earnings Write-Offs Translation Adjustments Reclassifications and Other Balance at End of Year 2022 $ 121.6 $ 6.2 $ ( 12.4 ) $ ( 5.8 ) $ ( 0.3 ) $ 109.3 2021 128.1 17.9 ( 17.7 ) ( 6.5 ) ( 0.2 ) 121.6 2020 113.5 20.3 ( 17.8 ) 8.1 4.0 128.1 Bad debt expense is recorded as selling and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by our clients and other difficulties collecting amounts billed. On the other hand, an improved write-off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision. 61 Advertising Costs We expense production costs of advertising as they are incurred. Advertising expenses were $ 29.6 , $ 28.1 and $ 22.2 in 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 3.6 , $ 15.2 and $ 110.7 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid out of our restructuring reserve were $ 13.7 and $ 38.0 in 2022 and 2021 , respectively. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 13.2 reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 1.9 $ 3.5 $ 40.7 $ — $ — 46.1 Severance costs 5.2 — 10.0 — — 15.2 Costs paid ( 6.1 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 29.2 ) — — ( 38.0 ) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 21.5 $ — $ — $ 23.3 Severance costs 1.7 — 0.8 0.1 — 2.6 Other costs — 0.9 — 0.1 1.0 Costs paid ( 1.7 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 11.3 ) — — ( 13.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 11.0 $ 0.2 $ — $ 13.2 Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 62 Fair Value Measurements The assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Deferred compensation plan assets $ 115.3 $ 115.3 $ — $ — $ 138.0 $ 138.0 $ — $ — Cross-currency swaps 13.8 — 13.8 — 24.7 — 24.7 — Foreign currency forward contracts 0.2 — 0.2 — — — — — $ 129.3 $ 115.3 $ 14.0 $ — $ 162.7 $ 138.0 $ 24.7 $ — Liabilities Cross-currency swaps $ 25.8 $ — $ 25.8 $ — $ 24.2 $ — $ 24.2 $ — Foreign currency forward contracts — — — — 5.5 — 5.5 — $ 25.8 $ — $ 25.8 $ — $ 29.7 $ — $ 29.7 $ — We determine the fair value of our deferred compensation plan assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are measured at the value based on a third party valuation model that performs a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and market observable inputs such as current and forward interest rates and current and forward foreign exchange rates The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our variable-rate long-term debt and revolving debt facility approximates fair value. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 921.7 and $ 1,064.0 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 956.6 and $ 1019.6 , respectively. 63 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We had goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,628.1 $ — $ 1,628.1 $ 1,722.2 $ — $ 1,722.2 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 818.9 $ 448.1 $ 370.8 $ 823.4 $ 421.6 $ 401.8 Other 21.3 20.2 1.1 23.2 19.7 $ 3.5 840.2 468.3 371.9 846.6 441.3 405.3 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 125.6 — 125.6 126.3 — 126.3 177.6 — 177.6 178.3 — 178.3 Total intangible assets $ 1,017.8 $ 468.3 $ 549.5 $ 1,024.9 $ 441.3 $ 583.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 694.2 and $ 644.2 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021 . The consolidated amortization expense related to intangibles was $ 37.1 , $ 24.2 and $ 27.2 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense expected in each of the next five years related to acquisitions completed as of December 31, 2022 is as follows: 2023 - $ 34.6 , 2024 - $ 32.2 , 2025 - $ 30.2 , 2026 - $ 26.7 and 2027 - $ 26.1 . The weighted-average useful lives of the customer relationships and other are approximately 14 and 4 years, respectively. The tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the tradenames, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Indefinite-lived reacquired franchise rights resulted from our franchise acquisitions in the United States, Switzerland and Canada. These rights entitled the franchisees with unilateral control to operate perpetually in particular territories and have therefore been assigned an indefinite life. In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2022, 2021 and 2020, and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of our annual tests. The fair value of each reporting unit at the time of our annual impairment test was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that approximated its carrying value. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2022 included a discount rate of 12.5 %, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 3.0 % to 8.4 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0 %. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins are determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential and our expectations of future business performance. 64 We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. Since the assessment conducted in the third quarter of 2022, we identified several factors related to our Netherlands reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount which triggered us to perform an interim impairment assessment. These factors included further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions, including downward revisions to projected Netherlands economic expansion in 2023, an increasing interest rate environment and financial performance that came in below management's planned revenue and OUP expectations for the fourth quarter of 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we wrote the carrying value of the Netherlands reporting unit down to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $ 50.0 . Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 included a discount rate of 13.5 %, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 0.0 % to 3.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 % and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0 %. Management continues to closely monitor the results of the reporting unit and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. The performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the Netherlands reporting unit. If the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, or if there is continued deterioration in the market due to macroeconomic conditions, some or all of the remaining recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 55.1 as of December 31, 2022, could be subject to further impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capitalized Software for Internal Use We capitalize purchased software as well as internally developed software. Internal software development costs are capitalized from the time when the internal-use software is considered probable of completion until the software is ready for use. Business analysis, system evaluation, selection and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software which ranges from 3 to 1 0 years. T he net capitalized software balance of $ 47.7 and $ 38.2 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The higher balance as of December 31, 2022 is primarily due to additional technology investments. Amortization expense related to the capitalized software costs was $ 9.8 , $ 5.5 and $ 1.8 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cloud Computing Arrangements We utilize cloud computing arrangements such as hosting arrangements that are service contracts, whereby we gain remote access to use software hosted by the vendor or another third party on an as-needed basis for a period of time in exchange for a subscription fee. Subscription fees are usually prepaid and recorded in selling and administrative expenses over the related subscription period. Certain implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements are capitalized in prepaid expenses or other noncurrent assets if they consist of internal and external costs directly attributable to developing and configuring cloud computing software for its intended use. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is recorded in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the cloud computing arrangement, which is the non-cancellable period of agreement, together with periods covered by renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. The unamortized implementation costs related to our cloud computing arrangements were $ 19.9 and none as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 65 Property and Equipment A summary of property and equipment as of December 31 is as follows: 2022 2021 Land $ 0.4 $ 0.5 Buildings 6.3 6.7 Furniture, fixtures, and autos 166.4 166.5 Computer equipment 130.1 132.7 Leasehold improvements 281.7 288.5 Property and equipment $ 584.9 $ 594.9 Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using primarily the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings - up t o 40 years; fu rniture, fixtures, autos and computer equipment - 3 to 16 years; leasehold improvements - lesser of life of asset or expected lease term . Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized whereas expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to income as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the difference between the unamortized cost and the proceeds is recorded as either a gain or a loss and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Leases We recognize right-of-use assets (“ROU”) and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months and we classify the lease as a finance or operating lease which affects the recognition, measurement, and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows. We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 11 years. Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases, and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of December 31, 2022 , we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. 66 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Translation Asset and liability accounts are translated at the current exchange rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rates each month. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in shareholders’ equity. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes is accounted for as a hedge of our net investment in our subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency. For this portion of the Euro- denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the amount of the related borrowings, net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ Equity The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million, 6.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock in August 2021, August 2019 and August 2018. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2022, we repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 2.0 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $ 270.0 . In 2021, we repurchased 2.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 210.0 . In 2020, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 264.7 . As of December 31, 2022, there were 2.0 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 or 2018 authorization. During 2022, 2021 and 2020 , the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $ 2.72 , $ 2.52 and $ 2.26 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend paym ents of $ 139.9 , $ 136.6 and $ 129.1 , respectively. Noncontrolling interests, included in total sha reholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded income of $ 0.8 , $ 0.7 and $ 4.7 for 2022. 2021, and 2020 , respectively, Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, term deposits with banks and short-term highly-liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value; and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2022 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures by business entities about government assistance. The guidance requires business entities to disclose, in notes to their financial statements, information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and could be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. 67 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2023. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Revenue Recognition Revenue Service Types The following is a description of our revenue service types, including Staffing and Interim, Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting, Permanent Recruitment and Other services. Staffing and Interim Staffing and Interim services include the augmentation of clients’ workforce with our contingent employees performing services under the client’s supervision, which provides our clients with a source of flexible labor. Staffing and Interim client contracts are generally short-term in nature, and we generally enter into contracts that include only a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each hour of Staffing and Interim service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting Our Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting services include utilizing consultants and contingent employees who are generally experts in a specific field advising the client to help find strategic solutions to specific matters or achieve a particular outcome. Our services may also include managing certain processes and functions within the client’s organization. We recognize revenues over time based on (i) our clients benefiting from our services as we are providing them, (ii) our clients controlling an asset as it is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance not creating an asset with an alternative use and having an enforceable right to payment for the services we have provided to date. We generally utilize an input measure of time for the service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of these performance obligations. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Permanent Recruitment Permanent Recruitment services include providing qualified candidates to our clients to hire on a permanent basis. We recognize revenues for our Permanent Recruitment services at a point in time when we place the qualified candidate, because we have determined that control of the performance obligation has transferred to the client (i.e., service performed) as we have the right to payment for our service and the client has accepted our service of providing a qualified candidate to fill a permanent position. Revenues recognized from our Permanent Recruitment services are based upon either a fixed fee per placement or as a percentage of the candidate’s salary. Our RPO services are also included in our Permanent Recruitment revenues. RPO services include the various activities of managing a client's permanent workforce, which can include candidate assessments, screening, conducting candidate interviews, providing sourcing technology, and providing our marketing and recruiting expertise. We perform these activities to fulfill the overall obligation to provide permanent workforce management services, so they are not individually distinct, and therefore, we account for them as a single performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time in months, but we do have a few contracts for which we use labor hours of management services provided as this more accurately depicts the progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of management services provided, as each month of management services is distinct, and the client benefits from each month of management services as we provide them. For those contracts for which we use labor hours as the input measure, we recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each labor hour of management services provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. 68 We consider the RPO management services and placement services to be distinct, and therefore separate performance obligations within our RPO contracts as (i) our clients can benefit from each service on its own, and (ii) each service is separately identifiable within the client contract. The prices as specified in our contracts will generally be broken out between management fees and placement fees, which we consider the standalone selling price of each service as they are the observable inputs which depict the prices as if they were sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. The consideration from our client contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. Other Services Other services include revenues from outplacement services, MSP services, training services and franchise fees. 69 Disaggregation of Revenues In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types and timing of revenue recognition and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenues by reportable segment.

Consideration received from share-based awards for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 0.3 , $ 5.1 and $ 7.4 , respectively. The income tax benefit recognized during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 2.6 , $ 1.6 and $ 1.7 , respectively, for the United States share-based compensation and $ 1.3 , $ 1.6 and $ 1.3 , respectively, for non-United States share-based compensation. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each award. Stock Options All share-based compensation is granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of ManpowerGroup Inc. (“2011 Plan”). Options and stock appreciation rights are granted at a price not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Generally, options are granted with a ratable vesting period of up to four years and expire ten years from date of grant. No stock options were granted in 2022. No stock appreciation rights had been granted or outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. A summary of stock option activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Exercise Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Outstanding, January 1, 2020 723 $ 87 Granted 156 93 Exercised ( 90 ) 59 $ 3 Expired or cancelled ( 1 ) 54 Outstanding, December 31, 2020 788 $ 91 6.2 $ 4 Exercisable, December 31, 2020 455 $ 90 4.5 $ 3 Outstanding, January 1, 2021 788 $ 91 Granted 130 92 Exercised ( 38 ) 93 $ — Expired or cancelled ( 28 ) 123 Outstanding, December 31, 2021 852 $ 90 6.1 $ 8 Exercisable, December 31, 2021 510 $ 89 4.8 $ 6 Outstanding, January 1, 2022 852 90 Granted — N/A Exercised — N/A Expired or cancelled — N/A Outstanding, December 31, 2022 852 $ 90 5.1 $ 2 Exercisable, December 31, 2022 639 $ 90 4.4 $ 2 Options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise Price Shares (000) Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (years) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares (000) Weighted- Average Exercise Price $75-$80 200 2.3 76 200 76 $81-$89 179 5.5 84 141 84 $90-$95 286 7.6 93 111 93 $96-$123 187 4.1 109 187 109 852 5.1 $ 90 639 $ 90 71 We recognized expense of $ 0.8 , $ 2.9 and $ 3.3 related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during the same periods was $ 2.8 , $ 2.6 and $ 2.3 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 0.7 , net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 Average risk-free interest rate 0.7 % 1.5 % Expected dividend yield 2.7 % 2.5 % Expected volatility 35.0 % 27.0 % Expected term (years) 6.0 6.0 The average risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (weighted 75 %) of our stock price over the past five years and implied volatility (weighted 25 %) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We believe that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than considering purely historical volatility. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option granted during the year was $ 22.83 and $ 18.95 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deferred Stock Our non-employee directors may elect to receive deferred stock in lieu of part or all of their annual cash retainer otherwise payable to them. The number of shares of deferred stock is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the terms and conditions adopted under the 2011 Plan; the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock according to these terms and conditions. During December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were 4,775 , 1,086 and 1,432 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. Non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of deferred stock (or restricted stock, if they so elect) as additional compensation for board service. The award vests in equal quarterly installments over one year and the vested portion of the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock either three years after the date of grant (which may in most cases be extended at the directors’ election) or upon a director’s termination of service in accordance with the terms and conditions under the 2011 Plan. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were 12,698 , 15,528 and 11,004 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. We recognized expense of $ 1.8 , $ 1.7 and $ 1.3 related to deferred stock in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and to non-employee directors who may elect to receive restricted stock rather than deferred stock as described above. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging up to six years , and in some cases upon retirement. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 72 A summary of restricted stock activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Unvested, January 1, 2020 446 $ 97 1.5 Granted 200 $ 92 Vested ( 145 ) 95 Forfeited ( 17 ) 93 Unvested, December 31, 2020 484 $ 94 1.4 Granted 208 $ 87 Vested ( 124 ) 106 Forfeited ( 23 ) 84 Unvested, December 31, 2021 545 $ 85 1.3 Granted 245 104 Vested ( 177 ) 80 Forfeited ( 25 ) 88 Unvested, December 31, 2022 588 $ 94 1.4 $ 49 During 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were 7,192 , 7,764 and 7,208 , respectively, shares of restricted stock granted to our non-employee directors, all of which are vested except for 1,258 shares granted in 2021 that were cancelled. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 19.1 , $ 15.6 and $ 15.7 , respectively, of expense related to restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 16.8 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. Performance Share Units Our 2011 Plan allows us to grant performance share units. We grant performance share units with a performance period ranging from one to three years . Vesting of units occurs at the end of the performance period or after a subsequent holding period, except in the case of termination of employment where the units are forfeited immediately. Upon retirement, a prorated number of units vest depending on the period worked from the grant date to retirement date or in certain cases all of the units vest. In the case of death or disability, the units immediately vest at the Target Award level if the death or disability date is during the performance period, or at the level determined by the performance criteria met during the performance period if the death or disability occurs during the subsequent holding period. The uni ts are settled in shares of our common stock. A payout multiple may be applied to the units awarded based on the performance criteria determined by the People, Culture and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. Final determination of the payout is at the discretion of the People, Culture and Compensation Committee (""the Committee""). In the event the performance criteria exceeds the Target Award level, an additional number of shares, up to the Outstanding Award level, may be granted. In the event the performance criteria falls below the Target Award level, a reduced number of shares, as low as the Threshold Award level, may be granted. If the performance criteria falls below the Threshold Award level, no shares will be granted. 73 A summary of the performance share units detail by grant year is as follows: 2019 2020 2021 (Regular) 2021 (Additional) 2022 (Regular) 2022 (Experis) Grant Date(s) February 15, 2019 February 14, 2020 February 12, 2021 February 12, 2021 February 11, 2022 February 11, 2022 Performance Period (years) 2019-2021 2020-2022 2021 2021-2022 2022-2024 2022-2024 Vesting Date (1) February 2022 February 2023 February 2024 February 2023 February 2025 February 2025 Payout Levels (in units): Threshold Award 61,381 59,698 61,076 39,882 — — Target Award 122,761 119,395 122,152 79,763 106,116 28,275 Outstanding Award 245,522 238,790 244,304 159,526 212,232 84,826 Shares Issued in 2022 81,700 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Payout Achieved Over Performance Period 81,700 — (2) 244,304 159,526 N/A N/A (1) Awards are scheduled to vest after the Committee determines the achievement of the performance criteria. (2) In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Committee exercised its discretion in respect of the payout of the 2020 grant. On the basis that an additional special one-time grant had been awarded in 2021 to supplement the 2020 grant, the Committee determined that the 2020 grant would have a zero payout. We recognize and adjust compensation expense based on the likelihood of the performance criteria specified in the award being achieved. The compensation expense is recognized over the performance and holding periods and is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. We recognized total compensation expense of $ 15.6 , $ 16.3 and $ 3.7 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the performance share units. For 2022, additional expense from the Experis award at the outstanding payout level was offset by the reversal of cumulative expense related to the 2020 grant upon the Board of Directors' exercise of its discretion to reduce the payout to zero. The higher expense in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted from a combination of higher estimated payout levels and the additional special one-time grant awarded in 2021. (4) Acquisitions and Dispositions ettain group Acquisition On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 930.9 . Of the total consideration paid, $ 925.0 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 5.9 was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $ 150.0 draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. We finalized the purchase accounting during the third quarter of 2022 and recognized post-closing working capital adjustments of $ 3.4 and income tax adjustments of $ 3.1 with a corresponding offset to goodwill. The acquisition of ettain group was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of ettain group were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. 74 The following table summarizes the final fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2021: Cash and cash equivalents $ 14.6 Accounts receivable 132.6 Prepaid expenses and other assets 2.6 Operating lease right-of-use asset 8.7 Goodwill 513.1 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 360.0 Accounts payable ( 21.6 ) Employee compensation payable ( 14.8 ) Accrued liabilities ( 28.7 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 6.9 ) Value added taxes payable ( 3.0 ) Long-term operating lease liability ( 5.3 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 20.4 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 930.9 The customer relationship intangible asset is amortized over a 15 -year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $ 330.0 and $ 513.1 , respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $ 354.0 and $ 519.6 , respectively. The goodwill is included within the United States reporting unit and is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies to occur post-acquisition as a result of diversifying the business into higher growth and higher value services. As of December 31, 2021, ettain group contributed revenues from services of $ 182.7 since the acquisition. Our consolidated unaudited proforma historical revenues from services and net earnings, as if ettain group had been acquired at the beginning of 2020, are estimated as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Revenues from services $ 21,269.1 $ 18,731.0 Net earnings 425.4 40.1 The proforma amounts are calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the results of ettain group to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming a fair value adjustment to intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2020, with the consequential tax effects. In 2021, we incurred $ 18.8 of acquisition and integration costs. These expenses are included in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and are reflected in proforma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the table above. Other Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding ettain group, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 20.2 , $ 8.1 and $ 2.6 , respectively. The 2022 payments primarily represent a consideration payment for the acquisition of Tingari, a talent solutions company in France. The 2022, 2021 and 2020 balances include consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 3.8 , $ 6.3 and $ 1.9 , respectively, had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. 75 As of December 31, 2022, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2022 acquisitions wer e $ 8.8 and $ 5.3 , respectively. A s of December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2021 acquisitions, excluding ettain group, were $ 3.1 and $ 0.6 , respectively. No goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in 2020. Dispositions Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $ 3.2 . In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $ 8.0 , of which $ 9.7 was included in selling and administrative expenses and a gain of $ 1.7 was included in interest and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. On September 30, 2022, our Belgium business disposed of its Service Voucher Division and recognized a one-time gain of $ 4.1 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 15, 2022, we disposed of our Hungary business in our Southern Europe segment and recognized a one-time loss of $ 2.1 , of which $ 0.9 was included in selling and administrative expenses and $ 1.2 was included in interest and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2021, we disposed of our Tunisia business in our Southern Europe segment and recognized a one-time loss of $ 1.2 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 30, 2020, we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $ 5.8 subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $ 5.8 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2020. (5) Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Current United States Federal $ 17.6 $ 20.2 $ 5.2 State 6.8 3.3 4.5 Non-United States 154.1 163.5 124.6 Total current 178.5 187.0 134.3 Deferred United States Federal 11.2 5.8 ( 11.0 ) State 0.9 2.4 ( 4.9 ) Non-United States ( 7.3 ) ( 9.5 ) 5.5 Total deferred 4.8 ( 1.3 ) ( 10.4 ) Total provision $ 183.3 $ 185.7 $ 123.9 76 A tax reconciliation between taxes computed at the United States federal statutory rate of 21 % and the consolidated effective tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Income tax based on statutory rate $ 117.0 $ 119.3 $ 31.0 Increase (decrease) resulting from: Non-United States tax rate difference: French business tax (1) 24.6 26.7 43.7 Other (2) 15.2 22.2 9.7 Repatriation of non-United States earnings 10.7 5.7 ( 2.0 ) State income taxes, net of federal benefit 5.5 5.0 ( 1.3 ) Change in valuation allowance (3) 13.7 22.0 48.5 Work Opportunity Tax Credit (4) ( 12.4 ) ( 10.9 ) ( 4.9 ) Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction ( 9.6 ) ( 10.7 ) ( 8.8 ) Goodwill impairment (5) 8.9 — 13.4 Other, net 9.7 6.4 ( 5.4 ) Tax provision $ 183.3 $ 185.7 $ 123.9 77 Deferred income taxes are recorded based on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Temporary differences, which give rise to the deferred taxes, are as follows: December 31 2022 2021 Future Income Tax Benefits (Expense) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance $ 8.8 $ 22.5 Employee compensation payable 37.7 38.9 Pension and postretirement benefits 65.0 77.9 Intangible assets ( 140.4 ) ( 135.7 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings ( 18.4 ) ( 16.1 ) Loans denominated in foreign currencies ( 0.7 ) — Operating lease ROU assets ( 92.9 ) ( 96.3 ) Operating lease liabilities 94.6 99.5 Net operating losses 128.9 129.4 Other 179.7 163.9 Valuation allowance ( 161.1 ) ( 167.1 ) Total future tax benefits $ 101.2 $ 116.9 Deferred tax asset $ 126.7 $ 135.0 Deferred tax liability ( 25.5 ) ( 18.1 ) Total future tax benefits $ 101.2 $ 116.9 Pre-tax earnings of non-United States operations were $ 380.9 , $ 433.6 and $ 86.3 in 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on $ 339.9 of accumulated unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We have not estimated the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine or immaterial to the financial statements. As of December 31, 2022 , deferred taxes for non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $ 1,227.8 of accumulated unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 18.4 and $ 16.1 , respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We had United States federal and non-United States net operating loss carryforwards and United States state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 651.4 and $ 141.3 , respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: United States Federal and Non-United States United States State 2023 0.1 8.2 2024 5.0 52.2 2025 2.7 5.3 2026 1.2 9.2 2027 3.4 5.7 Thereafter 8.0 52.6 No expirations 631.0 8.1 Total net operating loss carryforwards $ 651.4 $ 141.3 We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $ 128.9 as of December 31, 2022 , for the benefit of these net operating losses. Realization of this asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards. A related valuation allowance of $ 111.8 was recorded as of December 31, 2022, as management believes that realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is unlikely. 78 We had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 81.6 , $ 71.8 and $ 64.5 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . We believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between $ 16.1 and $ 19.4 in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We accrued net interest and penalties of $ 0.8 , $ 0.9 and $ 0.0 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2022, 2021 and 2020: 2022 2021 2020 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 67.3 $ 60.9 $ 65.9 Increases in prior year tax positions 10.5 4.6 1.4 Decreases in prior year tax positions ( 1.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 4.1 ) Increases for current year tax positions 2.3 9.0 3.2 Expiration of statute of limitations and audit settlements ( 2.6 ) ( 6.8 ) ( 5.5 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 76.3 $ 67.3 $ 60.9 Potential interest and penalties 5.3 4.5 3.6 Balance, end of year $ 81.6 $ 71.8 $ 64.5 We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2015 through 2022 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Germany, India, Israel, Portugal, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse impact on earnings. (6) Net Earnings Per Share The calculation of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Net earnings available to common shareholders: $ 373.8 $ 382.4 $ 23.8 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions): Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 52.2 54.5 58.0 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.2 — Effect of other share-based awards 0.6 0.7 0.3 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 52.8 55.4 58.3 Net earnings per share - basic $ 7.17 $ 7.01 $ 0.41 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 7.08 $ 6.91 $ 0.41 There were 0.5 million, 0.1 million and 0.6 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 79 (7) Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total (4) Balance, January 1, 2021 $ 536.6 $ 154.9 $ 326.6 $ 81.7 $ 126.0 $ 1,225.8 Acquisitions 522.7 — — — — 522.7 Currency impact and other ( 0.4 ) ( 8.2 ) ( 12.9 ) ( 4.8 ) — ( 26.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2021 1,058.9 146.7 313.7 76.9 126.0 1,722.2 Acquisitions ( 6.5 ) 8.8 — — — 2.3 Impairment Charge (5) — — ( 50.0 ) — — ( 50.0 ) Currency impact and other ( 2.8 ) ( 7.3 ) ( 28.9 ) ( 7.4 ) — ( 46.4 ) Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 1,049.6 $ 148.2 $ 234.8 $ 69.5 $ 126.0 $ 1,628.1 Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: December 31 2022 2021 United States $ 1,085.3 $ 1,091.7 United Kingdom 100.2 112.2 France 79.5 110.7 Netherlands 55.1 74.3 Canada 41.6 44.5 Other reporting units 266.4 288.8 Total goodwill $ 1,628.1 $ 1,722.2 (8) Debt Information concerning short-term borrowings is as follows: December 31 2022 2021 Short-term borrowings $ 21.5 $ 16.8 Weighted-average interest rates 6.1 % 7.6 % We maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2022 , such uncommitted credit lines totaled $ 318.4 , of which $ 288.5 was unused. Under our revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $ 300.0 in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $ 600.0 in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $ 270.1 could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2022. 80 A summary of long-term debt is as follows: December 31 2022 2021 Euro-denominated notes: € 500.0 due June 2026 $ 532.7 $ 565.2 € 400.0 due June 2027 423.9 454.4 Revolving Credit Agreement — 75.0 Other 8.4 6.9 965.0 1,101.5 Less current maturities 5.1 535.8 Long-term debt $ 959.9 $ 565.7 Euro Notes On June 30, 2022, we offered and sold € 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.50 % notes due June 30, 2027 (the “ € 400.0 notes ”). The proceeds from the €400.0 notes were used in July 2022 to repay our € 400.0 1.875 % notes due September 11, 2022. The €400.0 notes were issued at a price of 99.465 % to yield an effective interest rate of 3.514 %, net of a favorable impact of a forward starting interest rate swap. Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on June 30 of each year. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold € 500.0 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750 % notes due June 2026 (the “€ 500.0 notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 notes of € 495.7 were used to repay our € 350.0 notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 notes were issued at a price of 99.564 % to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809 %. Interest on the €500.0 notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Both the € 500.0 notes and € 400.0 notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2022. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement On May 27, 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of May 27, 2027 to replace our previous $ 600.0 revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes terms generally consistent with our previous 5-year credit facility, except the Credit Agreement uses Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base rate index instead of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $ 600.0 in various currencies, and up to $ 150.0 may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of December 31, 2022 and $ 75.0 as of December 31, 2021 under the previous facility. Outstanding letters of credit issued totaled $ 0.4 and $ 0.5 as o f December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additional borrowings o f $ 599.6 and $ 524.5 we re available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 10 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 102.5 basis points on any borrowings. 81 The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgements, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. Debt Maturities The maturities of long-term debt payable within each of the four years subsequent to December 31, 2023 are as follows: 2024 - $ 0.0 , 2025 - $ 0.0 , 2026 - $ 535.8 , 2027 - $ 424.1 . (9) Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans For all of our United States defined benefit and retiree health care plans, we adopted the Society of Actuaries’ Pri-2012 Mortality Table with MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale in determining the plans’ benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. In 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February 2020 and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (“PBGC”) in March 2020 triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The standard PBGC audit was completed in March 2021, and the remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement are being utilized to fund qualified 401(k) plan contributions in current and future years. In our Switzerland pension plan, we recognized a partial settlement as a result of local regulations and turnover common to our industry and reclassified pension losse s of $ 2.7 a nd $ 1.0 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 82 The reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans are as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 26.0 $ 28.5 $ 897.9 $ 965.6 Service cost — — 19.4 22.0 Interest cost 0.5 0.4 8.2 5.7 Settlements — — ( 57.4 ) ( 61.7 ) Transfers — — 31.1 52.8 Actuarial gain ( 3.7 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 218.7 ) ( 47.3 ) Plan participant contributions — — 13.0 14.1 Benefits paid ( 2.3 ) ( 2.3 ) ( 11.4 ) ( 12.8 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — ( 49.8 ) ( 40.5 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 20.5 $ 26.0 $ 632.3 $ 897.9 United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ — $ — $ 762.5 $ 753.6 Actual return on plan assets — — ( 166.7 ) 24.3 Settlements — — ( 57.4 ) ( 61.7 ) Transfers — — 31.8 52.8 Plan participant contributions — — 13.0 14.1 Company contributions 2.3 2.3 17.1 18.7 Benefits paid ( 2.3 ) ( 2.3 ) ( 11.4 ) ( 12.8 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — ( 41.1 ) ( 26.5 ) Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ — $ — $ 547.8 $ 762.5 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 20.5 ) $ ( 26.0 ) $ ( 84.5 ) $ ( 135.4 ) Amounts Recognized Noncurrent assets $ — $ — $ 26.6 $ 51.2 Current liabilities ( 2.4 ) ( 2.3 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 0.8 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 18.1 ) ( 23.7 ) ( 109.9 ) ( 185.8 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 20.5 ) $ ( 26.0 ) $ ( 84.5 ) $ ( 135.4 ) For both 2022 and 2021, the actuarial gain related to the non-United States plans' benefit obligation was primarily related to changes in discount rates. The settlements and transfers of the non-United States plans represent transfers in and out of temporary associates within our Switzerland plan. 83 Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consisted of: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net loss $ 4.5 $ 7.8 $ 4.6 $ 41.8 Prior service cost — — 3.1 7.1 Total $ 4.5 $ 7.8 $ 7.7 $ 48.9 The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $ 629.0 and $ 891.7 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The ABO for plans that have plan assets was $ 554.1 and $ 787.5 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The decrease in the balances in 2022 resulted from higher discount rates applied to all our significant plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2022 2021 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 113.4 $ 181.8 Plan assets 76.8 99.4 The projected benefit obligation (PBO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $ 652.8 and $ 923.9 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The PBO for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 117.4 $ 188.3 Plan assets 76.8 99.4 By their nature, certain of our plans do not have plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for these plans was $ 74.9 and $ 104.2 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The components of the net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for all plans were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost $ 19.4 $ 22.0 $ 21.0 Interest cost 8.7 6.1 9.4 Expected return on assets ( 14.7 ) ( 12.2 ) ( 13.5 ) Settlements 2.7 1.0 13.8 Net loss 1.8 4.6 2.7 Prior service cost 0.7 0.7 0.7 Net periodic benefit cost 18.6 22.2 34.1 Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligation Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net (gain) loss ( 40.9 ) ( 60.0 ) 44.1 Prior service (credit) cost ( 0.2 ) — 0.4 Amortization of net loss ( 5.0 ) ( 5.6 ) ( 6.3 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss ( 46.8 ) ( 66.3 ) 37.5 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ ( 28.2 ) $ ( 44.1 ) $ 71.6 84 The estimated net gain and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income/loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2023 are $( 3.3 ) and $ 0.7 , respectively. The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the benefit obligation were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.4 % 2.6 % 3.2 % 1.0 % Rate of compensation increase 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.9 % 1.7 % The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.6 % 2.1 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 0.6 % 1.1 % Expected long-term return on plan assets N/A N/A N/A 2.2 % 1.8 % 2.2 % Rate of compensation increase 1.3 % — % — % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans N/A N/A N/A 0.5 % 1.9 % 2.0 % We determine our assumption for the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. Our overall expected long-term rate of return used in the measurement of the 2022 net periodic benefit cost on non-United States plans varied by country and ranged from 0.5 % to 3.0 %. For a majority of our plans, a building block approach has been employed to establish this return. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income instruments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. We also use guaranteed insurance contracts for four of our foreign plans. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected rate of return. None of our United States plans has plan assets due to the settlement of the Qualified Retirement Plan liability during the first quarter of 2020. Projected salary levels utilized in the determination of the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans are based upon historical experience and the future expectations for each respective country. Our plans’ investment policies are to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Our long-term objective is to minimize plan expenses and contributions by outperforming plan liabilities. We have historically used a balanced portfolio strategy based primarily on a target allocation of equity securities and fixed-income instruments, which vary by location. These target allocations, which are similar to the 2022 allocations, are determined based on the favorable risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted within a specified range to advance our overall objective. The fair values of our Level 1 and Level 2 pension plan assets are primarily determined by using market quotes and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Insurance contracts and annuity contracts are measured at the present value of expected future benefit payments primarily using associated interest curves. Hedge funds consist of a number of diversified funds including those investing in international securities, equity and private partnership interests valued using market available data and various models and assumptions. 85 The fair value of our pension plan assets by asset category was as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents $ 18.3 $ 18.3 $ — $ — Equity securities: Mutual funds 114.5 114.5 — — Common stock 29.0 29.0 — — Fixed income instruments: Fixed income funds 73.7 — 73.7 — Bonds 38.0 — 38.0 — Annuity contract 33.5 — — 33.5 Guaranteed insurance contracts 21.3 — 21.3 — Other types of investments: Real estate funds 95.3 — 94.0 1.3 Insurance contracts 76.7 — — 76.7 Hedge funds 28.7 — 13.5 15.2 Other 18.8 — 3.3 15.5 $ 547.8 $ 161.8 $ 243.8 $ 142.2 Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents $ 18.8 $ 18.8 $ — $ — Equity securities: Mutual funds 141.5 141.5 — — Common stock 37.7 37.7 — — Fixed income instruments: Fixed income funds 175.0 — 175.0 — Annuity contract 51.7 — — 51.7 Bonds 44.9 — 44.9 — Guaranteed insurance contracts 21.3 — 21.3 — Other types of investments: Insurance contracts 129.6 — — 129.6 Real estate funds 102.1 — 100.8 1.3 Hedge funds 29.2 — 12.6 16.6 Other 10.7 — 3.4 7.3 $ 762.5 $ 198.0 $ 358.0 $ 206.5 86 The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the pension assets that are measured using Level 3 inputs. We determined that transfers between fair-value-measurement levels occurred on the date of the event that caused the transfer. Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of year $ 206.5 $ 242.6 Actual return on plan assets ( 61.2 ) ( 21.6 ) Purchases, sales and settlements, net 7.4 ( 3.1 ) Currency exchange rate changes ( 10.5 ) ( 11.4 ) Balance, end of year $ 142.2 $ 206.5 Retiree Health Care Plan We provide medical and dental benefits to certain eligible retired employees in the United States. Due to the nature of the plan, there are no plan assets. The reconciliation of the changes in the plan’s benefit obligation and the statement of the funded status of the plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 14.1 $ 14.6 Interest cost 0.3 0.2 Actuarial (gain) loss ( 2.1 ) 0.1 Benefits paid ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 11.5 $ 14.1 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 11.5 ) $ ( 14.1 ) Amounts Recognized Current liabilities $ ( 1.2 ) $ ( 1.2 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 10.3 ) ( 12.9 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 11.5 ) $ ( 14.1 ) The amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consists of a net loss of $ 0.5 and $ 2.2 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and a prior service credit of $ 1.7 and $ 2.3 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of the benefit obligation was 5.1 % and 2.6 % in 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of net periodic benefit cost was 2.6 %, 2.2 % and 3.0 % in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 87 The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for this plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Net Periodic Benefit Credit Interest cost $ 0.3 $ 0.2 $ 0.4 Net loss 0.2 0.2 0.1 Prior service credit ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) Net periodic benefit credit $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.4 ) $ ( 0.3 ) Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net (gain) loss $ ( 2.0 ) $ 0.2 $ 1.1 Amortization of net loss ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.1 ) Amortization of prior service credit 0.8 0.8 0.8 Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss ( 1.4 ) 0.8 1.8 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ ( 1.7 ) $ 0.4 $ 1.5 The estimated prior service credit for the retiree health care plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income/loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2023 is $ 0.8 . No net gain/loss is estimated to be amortized in 2023. The health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 6.7 % for 2023 , decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 % in 2031. Assumed health care cost trend rates are not expected to have a material effect on the amounts reported. Future Contributions and Payments During 2023 , we plan to contribute approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Projected benefit payments from the plans as of December 31, 2022 were estimated as follows: Year Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2023 $ 67.8 $ 1.2 2024 42.4 1.2 2025 32.9 1.1 2026 29.9 1.1 2027 27.3 1.0 2028–2032 158.3 4.6 Total projected benefit payments $ 358.6 $ 10.2 Defined Contribution Plans and Deferred Compensation Plans We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all permanent United States employees and various other employees throughout the world. With our company-sponsored plans, employees may elect to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans and we match a portion of their contributions up to a maximum percentage of the employee’s salary. In addition, profit sharing contributions are made if a targeted earnings level is reached at management’s discretion. The total expense for our match and any profit sharing contributions was $ 18.4 , $ 17.3 and $ 16.6 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In certain countries with statutory defined contribution plans, we pay a percentage of the employees' salary in pension premiums. The total expense for the statutory defined contribution plans was $ 31.4 , $ 32.2 and $2 7.5 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 88 We also have deferred compensation plans in the United States. One of the plans had an asset and liability of $ 114.4 and $ 136.9 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, with the remaining plans holding immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities. (10) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: December 31 2022 2021 Foreign currency translation $ ( 369.7 ) $ ( 180.8 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans, net of income taxes of $ 19.1 and $ 19.9 , respectively ( 132.8 ) ( 133.6 ) Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 5.3 ) and $( 16.4 ), respectively 53.4 ( 18.4 ) Gain on interest rate swap, net of income taxes of $ 0.4 for 2022 1.4 — Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 20.4 ) and $( 22.8 ), respectively ( 12.2 ) ( 56.7 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.9 and $ 1.6 , respectively 1.2 0.1 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 458.7 ) $ ( 389.4 ) (11) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 46.9 $ 38.8 $ 43.3 Interest income ( 17.9 ) ( 12.0 ) ( 13.1 ) Foreign exchange loss 11.9 5.2 4.9 Miscellaneous (income) expenses, net ( 16.3 ) ( 14.7 ) 4.8 Interest and other expenses, net $ 24.6 $ 17.3 $ 39.9 (12) Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. 89 The € 400.0 ($ 423.9 ) note s due June 2027 and the € 500.0 ($ 532.7 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2022. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments which matured in September 2022. In September 2022, we entered into a new cross-currency swap agreement that converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (""CHF"") payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiaries with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2022 2021 Euro Notes $ 60.0 $ 76.1 Cross-currency swaps ( 4.7 ) 6.7 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matured in September 2022 and we simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of September 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. In September 2021, we entered into a series of forward currency exchange contracts denominated in GBP. The economic effect of the forward is to eliminate the uncertainty in cash flows in GBP associated with a portion of our forecasted IT contract spend in 2022 by fixing the amount at £ 6.0 . Gains and losses from the hedge offset the foreign currency exchange impact of the contracts. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of € 300.0 and a fixed rate of 1.936 %, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of €400.0 notes to repay our existing € 400.0 notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of $ 2.0 , which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense. 90 We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on OCI, AOCL and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021: Gain (Loss) Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCL into Income Year Ended December 31, Location of Gain Reclassified Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2022 2021 from AOCL into Income 2022 2021 Cross-currency swaps $ 3.7 $ 11.8 Interest and other expenses, net $ 2.8 $ 13.7 Foreign currency forward contracts 0.2 — Selling and administrative expenses ( 0.8 ) — Forward starting interest swap 2.0 — Interest and other expenses, net 0.2 — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains and losses included in AOCL on December 31, 2022 to be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. In September 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in September 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.7975 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal on the note due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 91 The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Location of Gain Year Ended December 31, Instrument Recognized in Income 2022 2021 Intercompany CHF note Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 9.4 ) $ — Cross-currency swaps Interest and other expenses, net 9.4 — Non-Designated Instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ ( 29.3 ) $ ( 11.6 ) Derivative and Non-Derivative Assets and Liabilities The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, and 2021: Assets December 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net — 24.7 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net 13.8 — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts Receivable, net 0.2 — Total instruments $ 14.0 $ 24.7 92 Liabilities December 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2022 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt $ — $ 454.4 Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 532.7 565.2 Euro Notes due in 2027 Long-term debt 423.9 — Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 25.8 24.2 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities — 5.5 Total instruments $ 982.4 $ 1,049.3 The fair value measurements of these items recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (13) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease expense $ 132.4 $ 140.8 $ 143.1 Short-term lease expense 5.2 6.0 11.3 Other lease expense (1) 11.8 20.4 16.7 Total lease expense $ 149.4 $ 167.2 $ 171.1 (1) Other lease expense includes variable lease expense and sublease income.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, outplacement services, talent management services and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 94 Total assets for the segments are reported after the elimination of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany accounts.

The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ c ompensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company is named as a defendant in various legal proceedings in which claims are asserted against the Company. We record accruals for loss contingencies based on the circumstances of each claim, when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition. 97 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acco untants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 98 Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

By offering a comprehensive range of workforce solutions and services, we help companies at varying stages in their evolution increase productivity, improve strategy, quality and efficiency, and reduce costs across their workforce to achieve their business goals. ManpowerGroup’s suite of innovative workforce solutions and services includes: Our family of brands and offerings includes: 3 Our leadership position enables us to be a pathway to quality employment opportunities for people at all points in their career paths. Whether it is seasoned professionals, skilled laborers, temporary to permanent, parents returning to work, seniors wanting to supplement pensions, previously unemployed or underemployed youth and disabled individuals, ManpowerGroup has been connecting people to meaningful work for over 70 years. Similarly, governments in the nations in which we operate look to us to help provide employment opportunities and training to assist the unemployed in gaining the skills they need to enter the workforce. We provide a bridge to experience and employment and help to build more sustainable communities.

We are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 4 Our Operations Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. When demand drops, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline at the same pace as revenues. In periods of economic contraction, we may have more significant expense deleveraging, as we believe it is prudent not to reduce selling and administrative expenses to levels that could negatively impact the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with a days sales outstanding of 55 days as December 31, 2021. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Due to our industry’s sensitivity to economic factors, the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short-term nature of staffing assignments, it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with certainty. As a result, we monitor a number of economic indicators, as well as recent business trends, to predict future revenue trends for each of the countries and territories where we operate. Based upon these anticipated trends, we determine what level of personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities. During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have helped drive demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the global economy continues to grow and adapt with new technology, we are helping clients manage their workforce transformation and ensure they have the right skills now and in the future. Whether it is through workforce assessments, targeted training or by creating longer-term development paths, we help organizations and candidates adapt their skills to changing workforce needs. Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and industrial positions. These services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for over 70 years with a primary focus on the areas of office and industrial services and solutions. Our Talent Based Outsourcing offering within our Manpower brand includes outcome-based solutions such as management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities. 5 We provide services under our Experis brand, particularly in the areas of IT, Engineering, and Finance, that include high-impact solutions, and help accelerate organizations’ growth by attracting, assessing and placing candidates with specialized expertise to deliver in-demand skills for important positions. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates’ workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our Experis brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise or continue. Our Proservia offering within the Experis brand includes outcome-based solutions specializing in infrastructure management and end-user support. Our Talent Solutions brand specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and new solutions and creating added value that addresses our clients’ complex global workforce needs. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through exclusive outsourcing contracts. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative functions. Our Right Management offering includes our career management services that have historically been counter-cyclical to our staffing services, which helps to offset the impact of an economic downturn on our overall financial results. Americas We provide services as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The Americas segment had 481 branch and 182 franchise offices as of December 31, 2021. In the United States, where we realized 62% of the Americas’ revenue, we had 314 branch and 175 franchise offices as of December 31, 2021, as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. This includes business and personnel we added in connection with the ettain group acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico, Canada and Argentina, we had 172 branch offices and 7 franchise offices as of December 31, 2021. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise. Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower® service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchisee sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise. Our Manpower and Experis operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. During 2021 in this segment, approximately 35% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 21% from placing office staff, and 44% from placing professional and technical staff. For our United States operations in 2021, approximately 41% of the temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 13% from placing office staff, and 46% from placing professional and technical staff. Our Talent Solutions operations provide a variety of workforce solutions offerings including RPO, MSP and Right Management. Southern Europe We are a leading provider of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing services throughout Europe. The Southern Europe segment had 1,061 branch offices as of December 31, 2021. Our largest operations in this segment are in France (56% of the segment revenue) and Italy (20% of the segment revenue). During 2021 for our Southern Europe operations, approximately 74% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 14% from placing office staff, and 12% from placing professional and technical staff. 6 We conduct our operations in France as a leading workforce solutions and service provider through 523 branch offices as Manpower, Experis, including our Proservia brand, and Talent Solutions, and 154 branch offices under the name Supplay as of December 31, 2021. The employment services market in France calls for a wide range of our services including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. The temporary recruitment market is predominantly focused on recruitment for industrial positions. In 2021, we derived approximately 85% of our temporary recruitment revenues in France from the supply of industrial and construction workers, 14% from the supply of office staff, and 1% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In Italy, we are a leading workforce solutions and services provider. As of December 31, 2021, ManpowerGroup Italy conducted operations through a network of 206 branch offices. It provides a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis or Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. In 2021, approximately 67% of our temporary and contract recruitment revenues in Italy were derived from placing industrial staff, 6% from placing office staff, including contact center staff, and 27% from placing professional and technical staff. Northern Europe Our largest operations in Northern Europe are in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics and the Netherlands, providing a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services through Manpower, Experis, and Talent Solutions. Collectively, we operate through 350 branch offices in this region. During 2021 for our Northern Europe operations, approximately 37% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 24% from placing office staff, and 39% from placing professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, where we have the largest operation in this segment, we are a leading provider of workforce solutions and services. As of December 31, 2021, we conducted operations in the United Kingdom as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through a network of 58 branch offices and also provided on-site services to clients who have significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. During 2021, approximately 27% of our United Kingdom operation’s temporary recruitment revenues were derived from the supply of industrial staff, 19% from the supply of office staff, and 54% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, we also conduct operations as Brook Street Bureau PLC, or Brook Street. Its core business is secretarial, office and light industrial recruitment. Brook Street operates as a local network of branches and competes primarily with local or regional independents. Brook Street’s revenues are comprised of temporary and contract placements as well as permanent recruitment. APME We operate through 132 branch offices in the Asia Pacific Middle East (APME) region. The largest of these operations are located in Japan, Australia, India and Korea, all of which operate through branch offices. Our APME operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. During 2021, approximately 9% of our APME temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 61% from placing office staff, and 30% from placing professional and technical staff. On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining 36.87% interest under the equity method of accounting. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information.) 7 Competition We compete in the employment services industry by offering a broad range of services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, project-based workforce solutions, assessment and selection, training, career and talent management, managed service solutions, outsourcing, consulting and professional services. Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of United States dollars in annual revenues. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. In addition to us, the largest publicly owned companies specializing in recruitment services are The Adecco Group and Randstad. We also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies such as Recruit Holdings, Kelly Services, Robert Half, Kforce, PageGroup, Korn/Ferry International and Alexander Mann. It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the increasing demand for skilled people, employers’ desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including several of the employment services industry’s most recognized and respected brands; geographic diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and high-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, and large national and multinational client relationships. Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses are based on a local or regional relationship, and tend to rely less on longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. The large national and multinational clients, on the other hand, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to local managers. As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed. Legal Regulations The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us. In most countries, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, health and other benefits, anti-discrimination and workers’ compensation, govern the firm. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement. In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination. 8 Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subject to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission’s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises. Changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which workforce solutions and services firms may operate. These changes could impose additional costs, taxes, record keeping or reporting requirements; restrict the tasks to which contingent workers may be assigned; limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the relationship (with us or the client); or otherwise adversely affect the industry. Trademarks We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries and territories. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup ® , Manpower ® , Experis ® , Right Management ® , Brook Street ® , Proservia ® , Jefferson Wells ® , Supplay ® and MyPath ® have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Employees We had approximately 30,000 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we recruit millions of permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year on behalf of our clients. As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees. Human Capital We Are a Workforce Solutions and Human Capital Company. Our purpose is to provide meaningful and sustainable jobs and is rooted in our values: People, Knowledge and Innovation. Our almost 30,000 employees, spanning 75 countries and territories, help improve the lives of nearly 600,000 workers daily by providing access to employment and opportunities to reskill or upskill. These efforts support local economies and create economic opportunity for our associates. We Are Focused on Reskilling and Upskilling Workers and Future Workers. Through our partnerships with clients and nongovernmental organizations (e.g. World Economic Forum, World Employment Confederation and Junior Achievement) and our own research and solutions, we are advancing the global discussion around the skills preparedness of today’s workers and the definition of required skills for the future. Since 2016, through our Skills Revolution series, we have highlighted how technology and digitization would shift in-demand skills, exacerbate existing talent shortages, and require investments to reskill and upskill workers. In response to these accelerating trends, we launched MyPath, our global associate upskilling program for our Manpower brand, with the intent of connecting our associates to opportunities that can advance their skills and meet employers’ needs. Through this program, ManpowerGroup provides personalized guidance, career development, training and access to jobs especially in growth sectors including advanced manufacturing, information technology, supply chain and customer service. MyPath has impacted 154,000 lives by the end of 2021, and MyPath associates now represent 25% of our associate talent pool in certified markets, across 11,000 clients and 12 countries. As part of our plans to become creators of talent at scale, we are also innovating around skills development in Experis, through our investment in Experis Academy and tools such as Career Accelerator for our professional consultants. Our goal is for more companies to turn to us for our expertise in finding, retaining and reskilling diverse talent to enable them to accelerate their digital transformation and execute their business strategies. 9 We Are Focused on Our Diversity, Our People and Our Culture. We have a global footprint, though our teams are managed locally: 32% of our people are in the Americas, 30% in Southern Europe, 22% in Northern Europe and 15% in Asia Pacific/Middle East. Collectively, we are focused on advancing diversity, developing our people and assessing our culture to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace and the workplace. Advancing Diversity Our focus on diversity encompasses four goals: (1) globally, support gender diversity at leadership levels; (2) locally, address a second dimension of diversity based on gaps or opportunities within a country; (3) culturally, foster an inclusive environment that supports our diverse workforce; and (4) societally, advance employment security for workers while promoting upskilling, well-being, flexibility and income opportunity. We believe that diversity starts at the top. We are proud that our Board of Directors has exceeded 30% gender diversity for nearly 10 years, is 17% racially diverse and 33% non-US born. Our Executive Leadership Team, which reports directly to the CEO, is 27% women, 36% racially diverse and 72% non US-born. Our Global Leadership Team, the top 98 leaders in the company, is 33% women. For several of our large markets, including the United States, the second diversity dimension is race and ethnicity. Building upon our Courageous Conversations progress in 2020, more than 200 leaders in our North America team completed our INCLUDE training which was developed by our Business Resource Groups with the support and expertise of our Right Management team during 2021. INCLUDE helps leaders to remove barriers to inclusion in the workplace by helping them to (1) value the unique identity of others, (2) create psychological safety and (3) enable belonging. Additionally, our North American team achieved our current leadership goal of 40% gender diversity ahead of goal by more than one year. This inspired us to expand our goal to 50% gender diversity at the global level by 2025. Developing our People We believe that our future success is contingent upon the development of our next generation of leaders. We are investing in our people to support both our strategic ambitions and their personal goals. In 2021, we continued the expansion and revamping of our leadership development programs, even while the challenges of the pandemic continued. These advancements and investments are intended to develop the capabilities of our leaders at a time when leadership is increasingly complex. Our learning and development programming now includes segments extending to Accelerated Leadership, Strategic Leadership and our Future Leaders high-potential program as well as continued development of our current leaders. On completion of our leadership programs, the majority of participants make positive career moves – 60% after one year and 68% within two years. In 2021, we also increased our focus on learning through investment in the development of our Sales Academies and our Talent Agent program, training more than 3,700 recruiters and over 2,000 salespeople, while curating new online micro-courses for all employees. Evolving our Culture Through our listening strategy, we are committed to hearing the voice of our people more than ever. We continue to track engagement and leadership effectiveness through our ManpowerGroup Annual People Survey (MAPS) and have seen year over year improvements in both response and overall favorability ratings. In 2021, we launched our Culture Matters initiative. In this initiative, we are focused on corporate culture as an enabler of our strategy. We believe that further enhancing our employees’ engagement will enhance our business performance, will enable us to achieve strategic growth, and will benefit the communities in which we operate. As part of this initiative, we have reaffirmed our core values of People, Knowledge and Innovation, which we believe are important to our workforce. We continue to commit to our PeopleFirst approach, which we believe has been a distinguishing feature of our company since its founding. 10 Item 1A.

We caution you that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The extent to which we will continue to be adversely impacted could be material and difficult to predict. The coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”) and the actions taken by businesses, including our clients, as well as by governments and individuals in response to COVID-19 have adversely impacted our business, operations and financials result. 12 We expect that our business, operations and financial results will continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19. We cannot predict the extent or nature of these effects, which are dependent on numerous factors that are continuing to evolve. These include: the emergence of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant; the potential that Omicron or new variants will result in additional outbreaks that could be severe; the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and booster shot protocols and the willingness of individuals to become and remain fully vaccinated; the development and effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19; the actions or inactions of governments in response to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the policies they adopt, which may continue to include declared states of emergency and quarantine, and “shelter in place” or similar lockdown orders; the effect COVID-19 will have on our clients and their demand for our services, including full or partial closure of client facilities; and a decline in our productivity and our ability to provide our services to our clients if COVID-19 outbreaks continue to result in some workers being unable or unwilling to perform their jobs because of illness, positive test results, fear of infection, family responsibilities or for other reasons. In addition, COVID-19, and the related transition to remote work for many of our employees at the onset of the pandemic, has resulted in a significant change in their work and social environment. There is a risk that this, as well as other sources of disruption or stress, including those related to individual financial and family situations, may adversely affect our employees’ productivity, engagement, retention and personal well-being. We cannot accurately predict the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, which may be material. Any of the effects resulting from COVID-19 could also cause, contribute to or magnify the other risks and uncertainties described below. Company and Operational Risks Our results of operations have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions. Our business is sensitive to changes in global macroeconomic conditions. We have at times experienced uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions, including in rates of growth or decline in the markets we serve. Our operating countries and regions, which are increasingly interdependent, have experienced periods of volatile growth patterns or declines, and we expect that global conditions will continue to be characterized by instability and unpredictability. Such conditions have and may continue to cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new projects that require our solutions which could decrease demand for our various staffing services. While we experienced some recovery from COVID-19 related economic declines in many of our markets in 2021, the economic impact of COVID-19 continues to be uncertain and unpredictable, and there can be no assurances when and whether growth rates would return to pre-pandemic levels. If growth is slow, as a result of the pandemic or otherwise, or if it contracts for an extended period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. When demand drops or remains low, our operating profit is impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses do not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, some clients may slow the rate at which they pay us, or become unable to pay their obligations and our cash flow and profitability may suffer. Economic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, political volatility, civil violence and unrest, election results or other changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, trade disputes, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, social justice movements, COVID-19 and other global health crises, changes in immigration policy, the impact of supply chain challenges on our clients, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, inflation, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. In addition, there is a risk the current inflationary environment could have an impact on the countries and territories where we do business. We are particularly susceptible to changes in demand patterns and economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and 68% of our revenue. 13 There is a risk that economic conditions in European markets may continue to be negatively impacted by events in recent years which, in addition to COVID-19, have included labor unrest, civil protest, heightened trade tensions, and uncertainty around the impacts of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated. Even without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities. We may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients. There is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our diverse clients, which span all industries and whose needs may change rapidly as their businesses and industries evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 30,000 employees based out of over 2,200 offices in 75 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources, to maintain our corporate culture throughout the organization, to drive service improvements and to provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at anticipating or meeting the widely ranging needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. 14 We could incur liabilities or suffer reputational damage from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of personal or confidential data, and our use of data is subject to complex and ever-changing privacy and cybersecurity legal requirements that could negatively impact our business or subject us to claims and/or fines for non-compliance. In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment data, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is personal data and/or confidential data. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology systems and software, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including, but not limited to cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, use or loss of personal data and/or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, ransomware, systems failure, employee negligence or malfeasance, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy supply chain interruptions, social engineering attacks, viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks. An incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal and/or confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We regularly engage an independent external security firm to assess our defenses to a potential cyberattack, and these assessments may uncover new or additional vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a compromise of our systems and/or a loss of personal data. In a recent evaluation, vulnerabilities were identified that could facilitate or contribute to a security incident involving personal data. The assessment firm was able to penetrate defensive protections adopted by us, as well as protections that we obtain from third party providers. We are prioritizing the resolution of security gaps that could lead to a loss of personal data or to other damage. Despite our efforts to identify and address vulnerabilities in our systems, vulnerabilities in software products used by us are disclosed by our software providers on a daily basis, and attackers grow continuously more sophisticated in their attack methods, making it impossible to give assurance that our cybersecurity efforts will be successful. There is a risk that our and our third-party vendors’ preventative security controls and practices will be inadequate to prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, or fraudulent activity, especially given that third party attacks have become more common. In the past, our data has been exposed due to data security breaches at our third party vendors, but to date none of these incidents have had a material impact on our operations or financial results. Any such future events, such as unauthorized access or fraudulent activity with our third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, more of our employees are working from their homes or other remote locations than at any other time in our history. This transition, which occurred quickly beginning in March 2020, makes it more difficult for us to monitor their activities, the security of their work locations, insider threats, and data exfiltration. This has increased the risk of security incidents, which could include unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, as well as other types of fraudulent activity. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 15 The potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the potential for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and cybersecurity are subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the EU Court of Justice’s opinion in the “Schrems II” decision (which invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), as well as additional legislation in place, or expected to become effective, in various U.S. states and other countries. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, the GDPR and the CPRA impose significant compliance obligations that add costs and operational burdens to our business with respect to our collection, use, storage and retention of personal data. Compliance with these obligations could reduce operational efficiency and increase our regulatory compliance costs, and failure to satisfy these requirements may lead to significant regulatory enforcement actions and/or large private litigation in the event of a security breach or other violation. Under the GDPR, the maximum fine can be up to 4% of a company’s global revenue, and there is no maximum penalty under the CPRA. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims and losses related to violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws or security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach. We have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption, increased costs, and reputational risk. We have increasingly outsourced important processes of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs, supply chain interruptions, potential disruptions to our business operations, and reputational risk. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide important back-office support. We have increasingly centralized our vendor profile so that we are reliant on a small number of vendors for highly critical corporate and technology functions. While we believe these third-party vendors provide greater efficiency and expertise, our dependence on a small number of vendors increases the risk that our business will be adversely affected if our vendors are unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Similarly, our business continuity and our margins could be adversely affected if we needed to replace one of our critical vendors for performance or economic reasons. Our operations also depend significantly upon these vendors’ and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third-party vendors’ implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations, any of which could damage our reputation in the market. If we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 16 A loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer. Our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations. Intense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients’ staffing needs. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. In many markets, we have been experiencing an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. These labor shortages have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to large numbers of employees and potential employees leaving the labor market due to burn-out, resignation, early retirement, immigration challenges, workplace safety concerns, vaccine mandates, and childcare responsibilities. Workers have also impacted the labor market through increasing demands for change in employment conditions, such as demands for higher wages, remote work, and additional flexibility in work schedule. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. This is especially acute for individuals with IT and other technology skills, as competition for such individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Our global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control. With operations in 75 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, the impact of global climate change, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics, including COVID-19, and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results. 17 Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. We believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. For example, our brand and reputation could be associated with our position (either public commitment or silence) regarding various corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, including our goals for sustainability, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our positions and disclosures on these matters, or failure to achieve our commitments, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our relationship with certain groups of current or potential clients and employees. Reputation concerns could cause us to examine our relationships with certain clients and vendors, and choose not to conduct business with certain partners, which could negatively affect our performance or operational efficiency. Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services. From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights and may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or changes in law that diminish or remove our current legal protections could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. 18 Strategic Risks We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives. Our business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services. This includes expanding our sales in higher margin professional resourcing, such as our Experis brand in IT recruitment. There is a risk that our growth strategy in Experis may be impeded due to the scarcity of talent in the IT field, which is particularly in demand, and which may restrict our ability to fulfill customer requirements. Similarly, another aspect of our strategy to expand beyond our core staffing and employment services is through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. Our higher-margin Right Management career management services have historically performed well in periods of downturn, and it is part of our business strategy that this counter-cyclical effect would help cushion our results in the event of a future period of decline. However, in the event of a downturn, there can be no assurances that the margin contribution from Right Management would increase, or that it would significantly offset other declines we might experience in the business. Additionally, our workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client’s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions. Our business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant rapid disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 19 Our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful and may introduce unexpected costs. From time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets, including, in 2021, a significant acquisition of ettain group. These activities involve significant strategic and operational risks, including: These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. The integration of prior acquisitions, including ettain group, as well as entry into future acquisition transactions, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We could also incur impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges as a result of acquisitions we make. From time to time, we undertake dispositions via sales, franchises, joint ventures or other exit activities, and we may face risks related to such transactions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations in order to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. We have engaged in such dispositions in the past, including our recent disposition of Russia in 2022, and we expect that we will continue to dispose of portions of our business that are not meeting our performance or strategic objectives. Among other alternatives, this could take the form of a closure of a business, the contribution of the business to a joint venture, or an exit by means of a sale to, or a franchise arrangement with, a third party. There are risks and costs associated with any exit activities, which could include difficulties in the separation of operations, services or personnel, the diversion of management attention, and the disruption of our business. Any such transactions may require regulatory or governmental approvals, which could impede the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in, or liability with respect to, the divested businesses. As a result of divestiture transactions, we could incur severance charges for personnel and payments for lease and other commitments, charges from the impairment or write-off of assets, and other financial loss due to the transaction. Furthermore, there is the risk that we might lose customers, in particular multinational clients with operations in the exited countries or operations. Additionally, if we choose to enter into a franchise arrangement for a third party to operate our business in the exited region using our trademarks and other licensed assets, we face potential counterparty and reputational risks arising from the franchisee’s operation of the business. The reputational risks include the risk that marketplace participants, including clients, candidates and the media, may believe that we continue to control the operations of a divested or franchised business that operates utilizing our name or other trademarks. Financial and Market Risks Foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results. 20 During 2021, approximately 87% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $1,043.3 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2021, was denominated in foreign currencies, including $1,019.6 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported results and shareholders’ equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses unless we repatriate funds. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult. We seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2021, to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted by economic conditions affecting our clients. Our working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a focus on Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase, and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer. Our results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected. Our debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,118.3 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following: 21 Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. The lenders under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, or our interest expense may increase substantially. Furthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries, or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected. The performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries. Since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances. Our inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries. In a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business. In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may disagree in the future, with our judgments. Many taxing authorities are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded. 22 In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, recently released the so-called Pillar One and Pillar Two proposals which includes a global minimum tax mechanism. It is not yet known when or how these proposals may be implemented. The United States was also considering significant corporate tax changes in the proposed Build Back Better legislation, and it is unclear whether these tax law changes will be adopted in future legislation. These possible changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, could have an adverse impact on our current or future tax positions. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors. The market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2021, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $125.07 to a low of $85.97. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these “Risk Factors” and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: Regulatory and Legal Risks Our performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments. Our contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties or subcontractors to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our clients have become more sophisticated in their contractual negotiation process and more detailed in defining their operational requirements, including requirements to use the client's form of agreement. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners’ ability to meet our clients’ delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, including as a result of delivery challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability. Additionally, we may incur liability for the actions or omissions of our partners, subcontractors or vendors and we may face challenges or be unable to enforce these obligations against those partners. Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Mexico the employment services industry is heavily regulated and scrutinized. For example, in April 2021, new legislation was adopted in Mexico that affects many types of temporary placements under the country’s labor laws. The new law broadly prohibits the provision of our traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for special, deliverables-based projects outside of the client’s core business activity. This has had a material adverse impact on our business in Mexico. In Europe, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Moreover, many countries, including the Netherlands and Japan, have established regulations that require equal-pay for equal-work for temporary workers and fixed term employees. Furthermore, some countries are adopting more restrictive immigration regulations, which may lead to greater expense or inability to fulfill client demand, particularly in our cross-border talent solutions business. All of these continuously-evolving regulations could have a significant impact to our revenues, costs, and operating margins as we and customers adjust to these new regulations. 23 The countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: Other types of future regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results by making it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients. Failure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business. We are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our temporary associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business. We may be exposed to legal claims, including employment-related claims that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide variety of potential litigation and other legal claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some, or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us. For example, through our direct interaction with our clients’ businesses and facilities, including functions and systems that are sensitive or critical to their core businesses, we may be exposed to operational, regulatory, reputational and other risks specific to their business, including data security risks. These risks may be reduced through contractual provisions that limit damages or mitigate our responsibility for losses caused by our assigned workers; but these types of contractual protections are not always possible because we may perceive an important economic opportunity, because of the contracting practices of our industry competitors or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities could include possible claims of or relating to: 24 We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to the above risks. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business regardless of the merits of the claim. For example, in the past, we have devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based “wage and hour” claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we are often sued by plaintiffs in various other employment-related matters, including those seeking class action status in the US. It is likely we will continue to experience similar claims in the future, which may increase in number as a result of remote working assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increasing employment regulation at the state and local level. We cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our business exposes us to competition law risk. We are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate. Competition law authorities have investigated our business practices in the past in France and in other countries, and there continues to be a risk of such inquiries in the future. There is no assurance we would successfully defend against any such regulatory inquiries, and they could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome could result in liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult. Certain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include: In addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin’s “fair price” and “business combination” provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline. 25 Item 1B. Unresolve d Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2.

[Reserved] 30 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Measures — Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, see the Financial Measures section found in Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" Results of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 The financial discussion that follows focuses on 2021 results compared to 2020. For a discussion of 2020 results compared to 2019, see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 . During 2021, we experienced recovery in the majority of our markets as we anniversaried the COVID-19 related declines in our results that occurred in 2020. Revenues increased 15.1% in 2021 compared to 2020. Our 2021 results reflected the global economic recovery with strong hiring demand from our clients due to vaccine rollouts throughout the year and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in many countries resulting in increased demand for our services in most of our key markets. However, this recovery we experienced was not uniform, with some markets, particularly in Europe, continuing to experience COVID-19 related challenges. These challenges included the imposition of additional or extended lockdowns or other restrictions, mostly occurring during the first and second quarters, which impaired the rate of recovery. During the second half of 2021, we experienced a slowing rate of recovery, particularly in Europe, that was not only impacted by COVID-19 related challenges but also included additional challenges that impacted client demand for our services. These additional challenges included supply chain issues as well as labor shortages. We believe certain parts of the workforce did not return to the labor market in many industries and markets over concerns about the COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variants. Although we experienced strengthening demand across most geographies and industries during 2021 compared to 2020, uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. See Part 1, Item 1A, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks related to COVID-19. 31 In addition to the impact from COVID-19 discussed above, results for the year were impacted by currency. During 2021, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in our European markets, which therefore had a favorable impact on our reported results. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 3.0% favorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.17 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in 2021. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During 2021, we experienced the following quarterly changes to our consolidated revenues compared to 2020: first quarter revenue increase of 6.6% reflecting recovery in the majority of our markets as we began to anniversary the significant COVID-19 related declines in our results that occurred during the last two weeks of the first quarter of 2020; a significant revenue increase of 41.0% in the second quarter as COVID-19 had a significant impact on the entire second quarter of 2020, especially in April and May; 12.1% increase in revenues in the third quarter reflecting a slowing in the rate of recovery in a number of key markets compared to the second quarter; and ending the year with a 6.5% revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2021 reflecting the further slowing of our recovery rate primarily due to the anniversary of significant revenue recovery in the prior year quarter and ongoing COVID-19 uncertainty. During 2021 compared to 2020, most of our markets experienced revenue increases as the global recovery continued and as we anniversaried the revenue declines due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a 19.0% revenue increase in Southern Europe, mainly driven by the increased demand in France and Italy. We experienced a 17.4% revenue increase in Northern Europe primarily due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, mostly in the United Kingdom and the Nordics. Revenues increased 12.4% in the Americas driven primarily by the increase in demand for our staffing/interim services, increased demand for our RPO and MSP offerings in the United States and the additional revenues as result of the acquisition of ettain group in October 2021. We experienced a 4.4% revenue increase in APME primarily due to the increase in our Experis business. From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue increases in all of our brands during 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue increase in our Manpower brand was primarily due to improved demand for our staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the improved demand for our interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business and increased demand for our managed services, primarily in Southern Europe, and the additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of ettain group. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our RPO and MSP services, partially offset by the decline in our Right Management career transition business. As workplaces reopened across our geographies and workers returned in phased approaches, we saw increased client demand for our HR skills within our RPO business due to significant hiring activity. Our MSP business has remained resilient during the pandemic and we experienced growth during 2021 as we assisted more clients to develop customized workforce solutions. Our gross profit margin improved in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix as our higher-margin permanent recruitment business, which experienced a 45.5% increase (41.7% in constant currency and 41.4% in organic constant currency) during 2021 as a result of stronger hiring activity, represented a higher percentage of the revenue mix in our largest markets during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was also due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margins in the Americas, Southern Europe and APME, margin improvement in our Experis managed services business in Europe, and a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin consulting and MSP services. These increases were partially offset a lower mix of revenues coming from our higher-margin Right Management career transition business. 32 We recorded transaction and integration costs of $18.8 million in 2021 relating to our acquisition of ettain group in the fourth quarter of 2021. We recorded restructuring costs of $15.2 million in 2021 related to the Americas and Northern Europe. We also recognized a one-time gain of $10.0 million related to a long-term obligation in Northern Europe. Our operating profit margin increased 212.0% in 2021 while our operating profit margin increased 180 basis points compared to 2020. Excluding acquisition transaction and integration costs incurred in 2021, the one-time gain related to a Northern Europe long-term obligation, restructuring costs incurred in 2021 of $15.2 million and $110.7 million in 2020, $72.8 million of goodwill and other impairment charges incurred in 2020, and a loss of $5.8 million from the disposition of subsidiaries incurred in 2020, our operating profit was up 61.7% while operating profit margin was up 80 basis points compared to 2020. The operating profit margin increased mostly due to the improvement in our gross profit margin and our ability to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. Consolidated Results - 2021 compared to 2020 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2021 as compared to 2020. (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Reported Variance Variance in Constant Currency Variance in Organic Constant Currency Revenues from services $ 20,724.4 $ 18,001.0 15.1 % 12.1 % 11.3 % Cost of services 17,316.9 15,176.3 14.1 11.1 Gross profit 3,407.5 2,824.7 20.6 17.9 16.5 Gross profit margin 16.4 % 15.7 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 2,822.1 2,570.3 9.8 7.2 Goodwill impairment charges — 66.8 Selling and administrative expenses 2,822.1 2,637.1 7.0 4.5 3.7 Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues 13.6 % 14.6 % Operating profit 585.4 187.6 212.0 205.5 190.4 Operating profit margin 2.8 % 1.0 % Net interest expense 26.8 30.2 Other expenses (income), net (9.5 ) 9.7 Earnings before income taxes 568.1 147.7 284.6 275.2 Provision for income taxes 185.7 123.9 49.9 Effective income tax rate 32.7 % 83.9 % Net earnings $ 382.4 $ 23.8 1,504.6 1,465.2 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 6.91 $ 0.41 1,585.4 1,543.9 Weighted average shares - diluted 55.4 58.3 (5.0 )% 33 The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 15.1% (12.1% in constant currency and 11.3% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: The year-over-year 70 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: 34 The 7.0% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 (4.5% in constant currency; 3.7% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 100 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to: 35 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $17.3 million in 2021 compared to $39.9 million in 2020. Miscellaneous income was $14.7 million in 2021 compared to miscellaneous expense of $4.8 million in 2020. The change is primarily due to the pension settlement expenses of $10.2 million recorded in 2020 related to the settlement of our United States qualified retirement plan liability and the increase in income from our equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.7% for 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 83.9% for 2020. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 32.7% effective tax rate for 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, the recognition of discrete valuation allowances in Germany and the Netherlands, the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in Germany and the French business tax. The French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in 2020 due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. Net earnings per share - diluted was earnings of $6.91 in 2021 compared to $0.41 in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.17 per share in 2021. Restructuring costs recorded in 2021 and 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.07 and $1.56 per share, net of tax, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The acquisition transaction and integration costs in 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.27, net of tax, in 2021. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $1.14 in 2020. The pension settlement expense recorded in 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in 2020. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 55.4 million in 2021 from 58.3 million in 2020. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since 2020 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2020, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since 2020. Segment Results We evaluate performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 36 Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 12.4% (13.0% in constant currency and 7.8% in organic constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020. In the United States, revenues from services increased 17.9% (9.3% on an organic basis) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 67.6% (63.5% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 3.8% (5.3% in constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 95.9% (103.2% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of four fewer billing days. This improvement was driven by increases in Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 22.0%, 31.1%, 16.9%, 6.6% and 6.6%, respectively (14.1%, 76.7%, 19.0%, 18.4% and 13.1%, respectively, in constant currency), with the increase in Argentina being primarily due to inflation. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico of 22.2% (26.5% in constant currency) primarily due to the new labor legislation, implemented in July 2021, that prohibits the provision of traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for specialized services outside of the client’s core business activity. Although we believe the new labor legislation will result in significant revenue reductions in Mexico over the next few quarters, we believe the mix shift towards more specialized staffing will improve the margins of our Mexico business over time. Our Mexico operations generated approximately 1.9% and 2.8% of our consolidated global revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross profit margin increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the improvements in the staffing/interim margins, which were partly due to favorable direct cost adjustments incurred in 2021 in a market within Other Americas. The improvements were also due to the increases in our permanent recruitment business, and increases in revenues from our higher-margin MSP and RPO offerings in the United States. These improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable changes in business mix as the higher-margin Right Management career transition business represented a lower percentage of the revenue mix. In 2021, selling and administrative expenses increased 11.3% (11.7% in constant currency and 7.9% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in 2021 and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of an increase in profitability in certain markets. The increase was also due to acquisition transaction and integration costs of $18.8 million incurred in 2021 and an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology initiatives. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to $5.2 million in 2021 compared to $29.5 million in 2020, the decrease in software impairment charges and a decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.6% and 3.1% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 5.0% in 2021 from 2.6% in 2020 primarily due to decrease in restructuring costs, the decrease in software impairment charges, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, and an increase in the gross profit margin. The increase was partially offset by the acquisition transaction and integration costs incurred in 2021. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 3.9% in 2021 from 3.8% in 2020 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services increased 19.0% (15.0% in constant currency and 15.6% in organic constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, revenues from services increased 19.2% (15.3% in constant currency) in France and increased 31.0% (26.7% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France is primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 34.2% increase (29.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 69.2% increase (63.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 10.9% (7.1% in constant currency and 9.2% in organic constant currency) during 2021 compared to 2020, due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 33.0% (28.7% in constant currency and 34.4% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the disposition of subsidiaries in Other Southern Europe in 2020. Gross profit margin increased in 2021 compared to 2020. The increases were primarily due to the increases of 42.7% (37.8% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was partially offset by the decrease in the Manpower staffing margin as lower margin enterprise clients represented a larger percentage of revenues during 2021 compared to 2020. 37 Selling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (4.6% in constant currency) during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, and the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in 2020. The increase was also due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2021 from $24.5 million in 2020. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.5% for 2021 compared to 3.0% for 2020. In France, the OUP margin increased to 4.5% for 2021 from 3.4% in 2020 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 6.4% for 2021 from 4.7% for 2020 primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2021 from $3.4 million in 2020, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 2.8% in 2021 from 1.1% in 2020, primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2021 from $17.3 million in 2020, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, the increase in the gross profit margin and the loss on disposition of subsidiaries incurred in 2020. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 37%, 22%, 14%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 17.4% (11.4% in constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020. We experienced revenue increases in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium of 23.5%, 20.9%, 6.1%, 4.5% and 9.6%, respectively (15.2%, 12.4%, 2.4%, 0.9% and 6.2%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue increase in Northern Europe was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 45.5% increase (38.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. Gross profit margin increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the increases in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the declines in the Manpower staffing margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues consisted of revenues from our lower-margin enterprise clients. 38 Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.6% (0.5% in constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020. The increases are primarily due to the increases in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support increases in revenues and increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets. The increases were also due to the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues, and the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in 2020. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to $10.0 million in 2021 from $52.4 million in 2020 and a one-time gain of $10.0 million incurred in 2021 related to a long-term obligation. OUP margin for Northern Europe was 1.5% in 2021 compared to an operating unit loss margin of (0.7%) in 2020. The increases were primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, increases in the gross profit margin and the decreases in restructuring costs. APME Revenues from services increased 4.4% (4.2% in constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020. In Japan (which represents 47% of APME's revenues), revenues from services increased 8.7% (12.0% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 19.3% increase (14.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day. In Australia (which represents 14% of APME's revenues), revenues from services decreased 11.4% (19.6% in constant currency) due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of approximately seven fewer billing days, partially offset by the 13.2% increase (3.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business, the 51.9% increase (50.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. Gross profit margin increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the increases in our staffing/interim margins and the increases of 8.4% and 19.3%, respectively, (9.6% and 14.1% in constant currency, respectively) in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 11.2% (9.7% in constant currency) in 2021 compared to 2020. The increases are primarily due to the increases in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues and increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. The increase for 2021 compared to 2020 was also due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increases were partially offset by the decreases in restructuring costs to zero in 2021 from $4.1 million in 2020. OUP margin increased to 3.4% in 2021 from 2.9% in 2020 due to the improvements in the gross profit margins and decreases in restructuring costs. 39 Financial Measures Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Certain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2021, we had $769.4 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund corporate activities. As of December 31, 2021, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,473.3 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $16.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. As of December 31, 2021, we had an additional $343.8 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes as amounts are deemed indefinitely reinvested. We have not estimated the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine or immaterial to the financial statements. Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate. Cash provided by operating activities was $644.8 million, $936.4 million and $814.4 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $135.6 million, $703.6 million and $313.2 million of cash in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in 2021 from 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the stronger market environment as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has stabilized in many parts of the world, offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing. The change in 2020 from 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable, due to collections and the receivables not being replaced at the same level as a result of a decrease in demand for our services, and the benefit of certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis. These improvements in our cash flows were partially offset by the decrease in our payroll-related liabilities due to lower activity. The CICE payroll tax credits are creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2019, we sold a portion of our CICE earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $103.5 million (€92.0 million) with the remaining amount to be used against future tax payments. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services. Accounts receivable increased to $5,448.2 million as of December 31, 2021 from $4,912.4 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by one day from December 31, 2020 to 55 days as of December 31, 2021 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. Capital expenditures were $64.2 million, $50.7 million and $52.9 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $26.9 million in 2021, $14.0 million in 2020 and $2.0 million in 2019. The higher expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to additional technology investment and the timing of capital expenditures. The lower expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019 are primarily due to overall scale-back of activities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis, completion of a software development project in 2019, and the timing of capital expenditures, partially offset by additional technology investments. Net debt borrowings were $70.3 million in 2021 as compared to net debt payments of $38.5 million in 2020 and net debt borrowings of $19.5 million in 2019. We drew $150.0 million as of October 1, 2021 in conjunction with the funding of the ettain group acquisition and $75.0 million remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021. We intend to repay the outstanding balance during 2022. 41 The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million, 6.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock in August 2021, August 2019 and August 2018. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2021, we repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a total cost of $210.0 million. In 2020, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $264.7 million. In 2019, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $203.0 million under the 2018 authorization. As of December 31, 2021, there were 4.0 million and 1.2 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $2.52, $2.26 and $2.18 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $136.6 million, $129.1 million and $129.3 million, respectively. We have aggregate commitments of $2,100.0 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows: (in millions) Total 2022 2023–2024 2025–2026 Thereafter Long-term debt including interest $ 1,077.7 $ 472.9 $ 19.8 $ 585.0 $ — Short-term borrowings 98.2 98.2 — — — Operating leases 416.7 119.0 156.6 73.4 67.7 Severance and other costs 23.3 19.9 3.3 0.1 — Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act 101.2 11.9 52.1 37.2 — Other 383.0 190.7 135.6 13.3 43.4 $ 2,100.1 $ 912.6 $ 367.4 $ 709.0 $ 111.1 Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $56.6 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled. We recorded net restructuring costs of $15.2 million, $110.7 million and $42.0 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $27.3 million during 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2020. The costs paid or utilized out of our restructuring reserve were $38.0 million during 2021. We have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $769.3 million as of December 31, 2021 ($717.7 million for guarantees and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.8 million for 2021. Total capitalization as of December 31, 2021 was $3,650.0 million, comprised of $1,118.3 million in debt and $2,531.7 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 31%, 31% and 28% as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Acquisitions On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $930.9 million. Of the total consideration paid, $925.0 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $5.9 million was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $150.0 million draw on our revolving debt facility on October 1, 2021. We expect to finalize the net working capital adjustments in 2022. 42 The acquisition of ettain group was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of ettain group were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The customer relationship intangible asset will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $354.0 million and $519.6 million, respectively. On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $219.5 million and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $161.2 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate cash consideration paid reflects a post-closing settlement of net debt and net working capital adjustments of $6.8 million, which we paid out during the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $415.1 million, or $97.6 million net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million, which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million, $32.5 million represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill resulting from the Manpower Switzerland acquisition was $44.5 million and $34.2 million, respectively. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding ettain group, Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $8.1 million, $2.6 million and $47.7 million, respectively. The 2021, 2020 and 2019 balances include consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $6.3 million, $1.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively, had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2021 acquisitions, excluding ettain group, were $3.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. No goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in 2020. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2019 acquisitions, excluding Manpower Switzerland, were $14.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively. Dispositions Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for $4.0 million, consisting of upfront cash proceeds received of $3.2 million and $0.8 million of deferred consideration. We simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new ownership of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we anticipate recognizing a one-time loss on disposition of approximately $8.0 million during the first quarter of 2022. We will finalize our accounting for the disposition during the first quarter of 2022. 43 In November 2021, we disposed of our Tunisia business in our Southern Europe segment and recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $1.2 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 30, 2020, we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for $5.8 million, subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $5.8 million, which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25% of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25%, and then further diluted to 36.87% as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $30.4 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the $30.4 million was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $6.2 million related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive loss. Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the “€500.0 million notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 million notes of €495.7 million were used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the €500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the ""€400.0 million notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets upon replacement of either the €500.0 million notes or the €400.0 million notes. Both the €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2021. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) 44 Revolving Credit Agreement We have a Five-Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks through June 18, 2023. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit, with an option to request an increase to the total availability by an additional $200.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. We had $75.0 million borrowed under this facility as of December 31, 2021, and no borrowings as of December 31, 2020. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Additional borrowings of $524.5 million and $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our interest and facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.3 million to $1.2 million annually. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. In the Credit Agreement, Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash in excess of $400.0 million. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. As defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.97 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5.12 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2021. Other In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2021, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $338.6 million, of which $314.9 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $276.3 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2021. Our long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance. COVID-19 We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of December 31, 2021 and for the near future. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $847.8 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, of which just $75.0 million was used as of December 31, 2021, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $276.3 million was available to use as of December 31, 2021. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,019.6 m illion as of December 31, 2021 mature in June 2026 and September 2022, and we plan to refinance the €400.0 million note in 2022; thus, there will be no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, notwithstanding th e cash used to fund the ettain group acquisition on October 1, 2021, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. 45 Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Business Combinations Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). As part of the accounting for the acquisition, we identified and recorded a customer relationship intangible asset of $360.0 million which will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. We utilized the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the customer relationship asset, which required management to make significant assumptions in the model, but was calculated based on the historical customer sales of the acquired company. A change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a decrease of $66.0 million or an increase of $87.0 million in intangible assets, respectively, but would not result in a material change to future amortization expense Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $22.2 million, $34.1 million and $17.2 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in 2021 pension expense is primarily due to the settlement of a U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2020. Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $17.0 million in 2022. The calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact annual expense recorded related to the plans. In determining the estimated 2022 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 1.0% compared to 0.6% for 2021, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 1.7% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2022 estimated pension expense compared to 1.5% used for the calculation of the 2021 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would decrease or increase our 2022 consolidated pension expense by $0.6 million. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our 2022 consolidated pension expense by $1.8 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) 46 Income Taxes The accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not exceed the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements. We provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year. Goodwill Impairment We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment. The table below provides our reporting units’ estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 80% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2021. (in millions) France United States United Kingdom Canada Sweden Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 3,130.8 $ 1,480.2 $ 412.0 $ 203.5 $ 150.1 $ 130.5 Carrying values 1,358.2 912.4 335.4 103.9 85.4 123.7 As of July 1, 2021, the fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20% in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.5%. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2021 were a discount rate of 10.4%, revenue growth for the next three years ranging from 3.0%-5.0%, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0%, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5%. If the Netherlands reporting cannot meet its operating targets and/or recover from the deteriorated macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, it may not achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above and some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $112.2 million as of December 31, 2021, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20% or more of their respective carrying values, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations Market Risks We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Exchange Rates Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries and our Euro-denominated borrowings. For our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rates impact the United States dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in the subsidiaries and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries. Approximately 87% of our revenues and profits are generated outside of the United States, with 47% generated from our European operations with a Euro-functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, particularly the Euro, may have a significant impact on our reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates each month. Consequently, as the value of the United States dollar changes relative to the currencies of our major markets, our reported results vary. The United States dollar weakened in 2021 on average, whereas it strengthened in the first half of 2020 and weakened in the second half of 2020 against many of the currencies of our major markets. Revenues from services in constant currency were 3.0% and 0.2% lower than reported revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. A change in the strength of the United States dollar by an additional 10% would have impacted our revenues from services by approximately 8.7% from the amounts reported in both 2021 and 2020. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the United States dollar amount of our shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of our non-United States subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, particularly in Euro- and GBP-functional currencies. Consequently, shareholders’ equity decreased by $46.9 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2021. If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2021, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have decreased by approximately $80.0 million from the amounts reported. As of December 31, 2020, the United States dollar weakened relative to many foreign currencies compared to December 31, 2019, particularly in Euro- and GBP-functional currencies. Consequently, shareholders’ equity increased by $82.3 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2020. If the United States dollar had weakened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2020, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have increased by approximately $124.0 million from the amounts reported. Although currency fluctuations impact our reported results and shareholders’ equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. We generally have few cross-border transfers of funds, except for transfers to the United States for payment of license fees and interest expense on intercompany loans, working capital loans made between the United States and our foreign subsidiaries, dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, and payments between certain countries and territories for services provided. To reduce the currency risk related to these transactions, we may borrow funds in the relevant foreign currency under our revolving credit agreement or we may enter into a forward contract to hedge the transfer. 48 As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding $1,019.6 million in principal amount of Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2021. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ equity increased by $59.0 million, net of tax, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2021, due to the currency impact on these designated borrowings. The hypothetical impact of the stated change in rates on 2021 total other comprehensive income (loss) for the Euro Notes and forward contracts is as follows: 2021 (in millions) Market Sensitive Instrument 10% Depreciation in Exchange Rates 10% Appreciation in Exchange Rates Euro Notes: €500.0, 1.81% Notes due June 2026 $ 56.8 $ (56.8 ) €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 45.5 (45.5 ) Forward contracts: £(5.7) to $(7.8) $ 0.8 $ (0.8 ) €(147.3) to $(174.2) 16.9 (16.9 ) ¥228.0 to $2.0 (0.2 ) 0.2 Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had the following fixed- and variable-rate borrowings: (in millions) Amount Weighted- Average Interest Rate (1) Variable-rate borrowings $ 16.8 7.6 % Fixed-rate borrowings 1,101.5 1.8 % Total debt $ 1,118.3 (1) The rates are impacted by currency exchange rate movements. Impact of Economic Conditions One of the principal attractions of using workforce solutions and service providers is to maintain a flexible supply of labor to meet changing economic conditions. Therefore, the industry has been and remains sensitive to economic cycles. To help minimize the effects of these economic cycles, we offer clients a continuum of services to meet their needs throughout the business cycle. We believe that the breadth of our operations and the diversity of our service mix cushion us against the impact of an adverse economic cycle in any single country or industry. However, adverse economic conditions in any of our largest markets, or in several markets simultaneously, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in I nternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at ettain group, which was acquired on October 1, 2021, and whose financial statements constitute 10% of total assets and 1% of revenues of the financial statements amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at ettain group. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 18, 2022 51 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of ManpowerGroup Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill - United Kingdom and Netherlands Reporting Units – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The annual impairment test of goodwill at a reporting unit level is performed annually during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its respective carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. 52 Given that forecasted revenues and operating unit profit margins for the Netherlands and United Kingdom reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in demand and efficiency of operations, and considering the low excess fair value of these reporting units, auditing these estimates and assumptions including the selected discount rates involved especially subjective judgment. As a result, we identified the Company’s evaluation of goodwill impairment for the Netherlands and United Kingdom reporting units as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment and the increased extent of effort that was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s significant estimates and assumptions, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins, and the selection of discount rates for the Netherlands and United Kingdom reporting units included the following, among others: Acquisitions - ettain group (Valuation of Customer Relationship Intangible Asset) – Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description In October 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of ettain group. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets of $360 million, all of which related to a customer relationship asset. The Company used the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the customer relationship asset, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions in developing forecasted cash flows attributable to the existing customers, the customer attrition rate, and discount rate. We identified the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset on the acquisition date as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment required to evaluate the significant estimates made in determining fair value, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's key assumptions and estimates related to the customer attrition rate and discount rate. 53 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset for ettain group included the following, among others: /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 18, 2022 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005. 54 CONSOLIDATED STATEM ENTS OF OPERATIONS in millions, except per share data Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Revenues from services $ 20,724.4 $ 18,001.0 $ 20,863.5 Cost of services 17,316.9 15,176.3 17,488.4 Gross profit 3,407.5 2,824.7 3,375.1 Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 2,822.1 2,570.3 2,666.2 Goodwill impairment charges — 66.8 64.0 Selling and administrative expenses 2,822.1 2,637.1 2,730.2 Operating profit 585.4 187.6 644.9 Interest and other expenses (income), net 17.3 39.9 ( 40.6 ) Earnings before income taxes 568.1 147.7 685.5 Provision for income taxes 185.7 123.9 219.8 Net earnings $ 382.4 $ 23.8 $ 465.7 Net earnings per share - basic $ 7.01 $ 0.41 $ 7.78 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 6.91 $ 0.41 $ 7.72 Weighted average shares - basic 54.5 58.0 59.9 Weighted average shares - diluted 55.4 58.3 60.3 The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements. 58 NOTES T O CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in millions, except share and per share data Nature of Operations ManpowerGroup Inc. is a world leader in the innovative workforce solutions and services industry. Our global network of over 2,200 offices in 75 countries and territories allows us to meet the needs of our global, multinational and local clients across all major industry segments. Our largest operations, based on revenues, are located in France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. We specialize in permanent, temporary and contract recruitment and assessment; training and development; outsourcing; career management and workforce consulting services. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. The COVID-19 crisis began to negatively impact our business, operations and consolidated financial statements during the last two weeks of March 2020, with significant lockdown measures implemented by the end of March 2020 in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. We continued to experience the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in 2021, particularly related to the impact on supply chains and labor shortages as we believe certain parts of the workforce did not return to the labor market in many industries and markets over concerns about the COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variants. Although many markets strengthened throughout 2021, the COVID-19 crisis had an adverse effect of curtailing economic activity in certain markets, affecting demand for our services. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We continue to monitor and assess the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 59 Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include our operating results and the operating results of all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and the noncontrolling shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, or we have significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for equity investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our ownership share of earnings of these equity method investments, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments, as well as certain other relationships, are also evaluated for consolidation under the accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. These investments were $ 114.2 and $ 106.6 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are $ 11.8 and $ 8.0 , respectively, of unremitted earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method. The amounts relate to accounting for our remaining interest in ManpowerGroup Greater China under the equity method subsequent to deconsolidation (see Note 4 for further information). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenues We recognize revenues when control of the promised services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of any sales, value added, or other taxes collected from our clients. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service to the client, and it is the unit of account in the accounting guidance for revenue recognition. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in our contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. However, we have multiple performance obligations within our Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) contracts as discussed below. For performance obligations that we satisfy over time, revenues are recognized by consistently applying a method of measuring progress toward satisfaction of that performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time (e.g., hours, weeks, months) of service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of each performance obligation. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices included in the client contracts, using expected costs plus margin, or other observable prices. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Certain client contracts have variable consideration, including credits, sales allowances, rebates or other similar items that generally reduce the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration using whichever method, either the expected value method or most likely amount method, better predicts the amount of consideration to which we will become entitled based on the terms of the client contract and historical evidence. These amounts may be constrained and are only included in revenues to the extent we do not expect a significant reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our variable consideration amounts are not material, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates. Our client contracts generally include standard payment terms acceptable in each of the countries and territories in which we operate. The payment terms vary by the type and location of our clients and services offered. Client payments are typically due approximately 60 days after invoicing but may be a shorter or longer term depending on the contract. Our client contracts are generally short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. The timing between satisfaction of the performance obligation, invoicing and payment is not significant. For certain services and client types, we may require payment prior to delivery of services to the client, for which deferred revenue is recorded. 60 In certain scenarios where a third-party vendor is involved in our revenue transactions with our clients, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent in the transaction. In situations where we act as principal in the transaction, we control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as gross revenues and cost of services. When we act as agent in the transaction, we do not control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as revenues on a net basis. A majority of these agent transactions occur within our TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) programs where our performance obligation is to manage our client’s contingent workforce, and we earn a commission based on the amount of staffing services that are managed through the program. We are the agent in these transactions as we do not control the third-party providers' staffing services provided to the client through our MSP program prior to those services being transferred to the client. For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. As allowed under the guidance, we do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to December 31, 2021 related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 34.8 and $ 34.9 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognized the entire amount of the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020 as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 . We expect to recognize the entire amount of deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 as revenue in 2022. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration for historical write-off experience, the current aging of receivables, market conditions and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. Balance at Beginning of Year Provisions Charged to Earnings Write-Offs Translation Adjustments Reclassifications and Other Balance at End of Year 2021 $ 128.1 $ 17.9 $ ( 17.7 ) $ ( 6.5 ) $ ( 0.2 ) $ 121.6 2020 113.5 20.3 ( 17.8 ) 8.1 4.0 128.1 2019 115.7 21.8 ( 19.1 ) ( 5.0 ) 0.1 113.5 Bad debt expense is recorded as selling and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by our clients and other difficulties collecting amounts billed. On the other hand, an improved write-off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision. 61 Advertising Costs We expense production costs of advertising as they are incurred. Advertising expenses were $ 28.1 , $ 22.2 , and $ 25.7 in 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 15.2 , $ 110.7 and $ 42.0 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $ 27.3 during 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $ 38.0 and $ 71.9 in 2021 and 2020 , respectively. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 23.3 reserve will be paid by the end of 2022. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 0.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ — $ — $ 7.3 Severance costs 5.5 16.2 49.8 2.5 0.2 74.2 Office closure costs 19.6 5.1 2.1 0.5 — 27.3 Other costs 4.4 3.2 0.5 1.1 — 9.2 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out ( 28.0 ) ( 21.7 ) ( 17.9 ) ( 4.1 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 71.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 1.9 $ 3.5 $ 40.7 $ — $ — $ 46.1 Severance costs 5.2 — 10.0 — — 15.2 Costs paid or utilized ( 6.1 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 29.2 ) — — ( 38.0 ) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 21.5 $ — $ — $ 23.3 Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 62 Fair Value Measurements The assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Deferred compensation plan assets $ 138.0 $ 138.0 $ — $ — $ 119.4 $ 119.4 $ — $ — Cross-currency swaps 24.7 — 24.7 — 12.1 — 12.1 — Foreign currency forward contracts — — — — 1.0 — 1.0 — $ 162.7 $ 138.0 $ 24.7 $ — $ 132.5 $ 119.4 $ 13.1 $ — Liabilities Cross-currency swaps $ 24.2 $ — $ 24.2 $ — $ 30.5 $ — $ 30.5 $ — Foreign currency forward contracts 5.5 — 5.5 — — — — — $ 29.7 $ — $ 29.7 $ — $ 30.5 $ — $ 30.5 $ — We determine the fair value of our deferred compensation plan assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are measured at the value based on a third party valuation model that performs a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and market observable inputs such as current and forward interest rates and current and forward foreign exchange rates The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our variable-rate long-term debt and revolving debt facility approximates fair value. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,064.0 and $ 1,159.1 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,019.6 and $ 1,094.5 , respectively. 63 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We had goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,722.2 $ — $ 1,722.2 $ 1,225.8 $ — $ 1,225.8 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 823.4 $ 421.6 $ 401.8 $ 473.0 $ 403.8 $ 69.2 Other 23.2 19.7 3.5 21.9 21.6 0.3 846.6 441.3 405.3 494.9 425.4 69.5 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 126.3 — 126.3 127.1 — 127.1 178.3 — 178.3 179.1 — 179.1 Total intangible assets $ 1,024.9 $ 441.3 $ 583.6 $ 674.0 $ 425.4 $ 248.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020 . The consolidated amortization expense related to intangibles was $ 24.2 , $ 27.2 and $ 29.8 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense expected in each of the next five years related to acquisitions completed as of December 31, 2021 is as follows: 2022 - $ 37.6 , 2023 - $ 34.2 , 2024 - $ 32.0 , 2025 - $ 30.0 and 2026 - $ 26.2 . The weighted-average useful lives of the customer relationships and other are approximately 14 and 3 years, respectively. The tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the tradenames, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Indefinite-lived reacquired franchise rights resulted from our franchise acquisitions in the United States, Switzerland and Canada. These rights entitled the franchisees with unilateral control to operate perpetually in particular territories, and have therefore been assigned an indefinite life. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland.) In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2021, 2020 and 2019, and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible as a result of our annual tests. The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.5 %. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2021 were a discount rate of 10.4 %, revenue growth for the next three years ranging from 3.0 %- 5.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. If the Netherlands reporting cannot meet its operating targets and/or recover from the deteriorated macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, it may not achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above and some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 112.2 as of December 31, 2021, could be subject to impairment. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and 64 experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2021 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. For the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included sustained operating losses resulted from the ongoing decline and increased uncertainty in the outlook of the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector in Germany, coupled with the significant implications of COVID-19. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 66.8 , which resulted in full impairment of the remaining goodwill in the Germany reporting unit. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value for our Germany reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test and our quarterly assessments in the intervening periods due to the factors discussed above. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote down the carrying value of the Germany reporting unit to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $ 60.2 during the second quarter of 2019. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to our New Zealand operations as a result of it not meeting profitability expectations. The New Zealand reporting unit is included in the APME segment. Marketable Securities Until April 2019, when we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise to obtain full ownership of the entity, we accounted for our 49 % interest in our Swiss franchise under the equity method of accounting. The Swiss franchise maintained an investment portfolio with a market value of $ 219.9 as of December 31, 2018. The portfolio was comprised of a wide variety of European and United States debt and equity securities and various professionally-managed funds, all of which were classified as available-for-sale, as well as cash and cash equivalents. We recognized all the changes in fair value on the investment portfolio in the current period earnings. Our share of net unrealized gains and unrealized losses that were determined to be temporary related to these investments was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with the offsetting amount increasing or decreasing our investment in the franchise. Realized gains and losses were immaterial for all periods presented. Other-than-temporary impairment amounts were insignificant. Capitalized Software for Internal Use We capitalize purchased software as well as internally developed software. Internal software development costs are capitalized from the time when the internal-use software is considered probable of completion until the software 65 is ready for use. Business analysis, system evaluation, selection and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software which ranges from 3 to 10 years. T he net capitalized software balance of $ 38.2 and $ 19.2 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The higher balance as of December 31, 2021 is primarily due to additional technology investments. Amortization expense related to the capitalized software costs was $ 5.5 , $ 1.8 and $ 2.0 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Property and Equipment A summary of property and equipment as of December 31 is as follows: 2021 2020 Land $ 0.5 $ 0.5 Buildings 6.7 7.1 Furniture, fixtures, and autos 166.5 167.1 Computer equipment 132.7 133.8 Leasehold improvements 288.5 306.2 Property and equipment $ 594.9 $ 614.7 Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using primarily the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings - up t o 4 0 years; fu rniture, fixtures, autos and computer equipment - 2 to 16 years; leasehold improvements - lesser of life of asset or expected lease term . Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized whereas expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to income as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the difference between the unamortized cost and the proceeds is recorded as either a gain or a loss and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Leases As of January 1, 2019, we adopted the accounting guidance on leases, which requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depend on the classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 11 years. Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease 66 agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of December 31, 2021 , we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Translation Asset and liability accounts are translated at the current exchange rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rates each month. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in shareholders’ equity. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes is accounted for as a hedge of our net investment in our subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency. For this portion of the Euro- denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the amount of the related borrowings, net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ Equity The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million, 6.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock in August 2021, August 2019 and August 2018. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2021, we repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a total cost of $ 210.0 . In 2020, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 264.7 . In 2019, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $ 203.0 under the 2018 authorization. As of December 31, 2021, there were 4.0 million and 1.2 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $ 2.52 , $ 2.26 and $ 2.18 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend paym ents of $ 136.6 , $ 129.1 and $ 129.3 , respectively. Noncontrolling interests, included in total sha reholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded income of $ 0.7 and $ 4.7 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and expense of $ 1.8 for 201 9. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, term deposits with banks and short-term highly-liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value; and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Payroll Tax Credit In January 2013, the French government passed legislation, Credit d’Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi (“CICE”), that provided payroll tax credits based on a percentage of wages paid to employees receiving less than 67 two-and-a-half times the French minimum wage. The payroll tax credit was equal to 4 % of eligible wages in 2013, 6 % of eligible wages in 2014 to 2016, 7 % of eligible wages in 2017, and 6 % of eligible wages in 2018. The CICE payroll tax credit was accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period earned. In January 2019, the French government replaced the CICE program with a new subsidy program. The payroll tax credit was creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years . Given the amount of our current income taxes payable, we would generally receive the vast majority of these payroll tax credits after the three-year period. In April 2019 and April 2018, we entered into agreements to sell the credits earned in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ) and $ 234.5 (€ 190.9 ), respectively, which represented approximately half of the credits earned in 2018 and substantially all the credits earned in 2017. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement were such that the transaction qualified for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective year. Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2021 In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did no t have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did no t have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures by business entities about government assistance. The guidance requires business entities to disclose, in notes to their financial statements, information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2022. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2023. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent Events On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for $ 4.0 , consisting of upfront cash proceeds received of $ 3.2 and $ 0.8 of deferred consideration. We simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new ownership of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we anticipate recognizing a one-time loss on disposition of approximately $ 8.0 during the first quarter of 2022. We will finalize our accounting for the disposition during the first quarter of 2022. 68 (2) Revenue Recognition Revenue Service Types The following is a description of our revenue service types, including Staffing and Interim, Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting, Permanent Recruitment and Other services. Staffing and Interim Staffing and Interim services include the augmentation of clients’ workforce with our contingent employees performing services under the client’s supervision, which provides our clients with a source of flexible labor. Staffing and Interim client contracts are generally short-term in nature, and we generally enter into contracts that include only a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each hour of Staffing and Interim service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting Our Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting services include utilizing consultants and contingent employees who are generally experts in a specific field advising the client to help find strategic solutions to specific matters or achieve a particular outcome. Our services may also include managing certain processes and functions within the client’s organization. We recognize revenues over time based on (i) our clients benefiting from our services as we are providing them, (ii) our clients controlling an asset as it is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance not creating an asset with an alternative use and having an enforceable right to payment for the services we have provided to date. We generally utilize an input measure of time for the service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of these performance obligations. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Permanent Recruitment Permanent Recruitment services include providing qualified candidates to our clients to hire on a permanent basis. We recognize revenues for our Permanent Recruitment services at a point in time when we place the qualified candidate, because we have determined that control of the performance obligation has transferred to the client (i.e., service performed) as we have the right to payment for our service and the client has accepted our service of providing a qualified candidate to fill a permanent position. Revenues recognized from our Permanent Recruitment services are based upon either a fixed fee per placement or as a percentage of the candidate’s salary. Our RPO services are also included in our Permanent Recruitment revenues. RPO services include the various activities of managing a client's permanent workforce, which can include candidate assessments, screening, conducting candidate interviews, providing sourcing technology, and providing our marketing and recruiting expertise. We perform these activities to fulfill the overall obligation to provide permanent workforce management services, so they are not individually distinct and, therefore, we account for them as a single performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time in months, but we do have a few contracts for which we use labor hours of management services provided as this more accurately depicts the progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of management services provided, as each month of management services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of management services as we provide them. For those contracts for which we use labor hours as the input measure, we recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each labor hour of management services provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. We consider the RPO management services and placement services to be distinct and, therefore, separate performance obligations within our RPO contracts as (i) our clients can benefit from each service on its own, and (ii) each service is separately identifiable within the client contract. The prices as specified in our contracts will generally be broken out between management fees and placement fees, which we consider the standalone selling price of each service as they are the observable inputs which depict the prices as if they were sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. The consideration from our client contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. 69 Other Services Other services include revenues from outplacement services, MSP services, training services and franchise fees. 70 Disaggregation of Revenues In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types and timing of revenue recognition and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenues by reportable segment.

Consideration received from share-based awards for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 5.1 , $ 7.4 and $ 7.0 , respectively. The income tax benefit recognized during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 1.6 , $ 1.7 and $ 1.8 , respectively, for the United States share-based compensation and $ 1.6 , $ 1.3 and $ 1.3 , respectively, for non-United States share-based compensation. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each award. Stock Options All share-based compensation is granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of ManpowerGroup Inc. (“2011 Plan”). Options and stock appreciation rights are granted at a price not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Generally, options are granted with a ratable vesting period of up to four years and expire ten years from date of grant. No stock appreciation rights had been granted or were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. A summary of stock option activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Exercise Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Outstanding, January 1, 2019 672 $ 85 Granted 174 84 Exercised ( 79 ) 65 $ 2 Expired or cancelled ( 44 ) 91 Outstanding, December 31, 2019 723 $ 87 6.1 $ 10 Exercisable, December 31, 2019 426 $ 82 4.5 $ 8 Outstanding, January 1, 2020 723 $ 87 Granted 156 93 Exercised ( 90 ) 59 $ 3 Expired or cancelled ( 1 ) 54 Outstanding, December 31, 2020 788 $ 91 6.2 $ 4 Exercisable, December 31, 2020 455 $ 90 4.5 $ 3 Outstanding, January 1, 2021 788 $ 91 Granted 130 92 Exercised ( 38 ) 93 $ — Expired or cancelled ( 28 ) 123 Outstanding, December 31, 2021 852 $ 90 6.1 $ 8 Exercisable, December 31, 2021 510 $ 89 4.8 $ 6 Options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2021 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise Price Shares (000) Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (years) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares (000) Weighted- Average Exercise Price $75-$80 200 3.3 $ 76 200 $ 76 $81-$89 179 6.4 84 103 84 $90-$95 286 8.6 93 39 93 $96-$123 187 5.1 109 168 107 852 6.1 $ 90 510 $ 89 72 We recognized expense of $ 2.9 , $ 3.3 and $ 4.0 related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during the same periods was $ 2.6 , $ 2.3 and $ 2.3 , respectively. As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 1.5 , net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Average risk-free interest rate 0.7 % 1.5 % 2.5 % Expected dividend yield 2.7 % 2.5 % 2.9 % Expected volatility 35.0 % 27.0 % 27.0 % Expected term (years) 6.0 6.0 6.0 The average risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (weighted 75 %) of our stock price over the past five years and implied volatility (weighted 25 %) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We believe that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than considering purely historical volatility. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option granted during the year was $ 22.83 , $ 18.95 and $ 17.78 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deferred Stock Our non-employee directors may elect to receive deferred stock in lieu of part or all of their annual cash retainer otherwise payable to them. The number of shares of deferred stock is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the terms and conditions adopted under the 2011 Plan; the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock according to these terms and conditions. During December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were 1,086 , 1,432 and 1,275 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. Non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of deferred stock (or restricted stock, if they so elect) as additional compensation for board service. The award vests in equal quarterly installments over one year and the vested portion of the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock either upon a director’s termination of service or three years after the date of grant (which may in most cases be extended at the directors’ election) in accordance with the terms and conditions under the 2011 Plan. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were 15,528 , 11,004 and 18,172 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. We recognized expense of $ 1.7 , $ 1.3 and $ 1.4 related to deferred stock in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and to non-employee directors who may elect to receive restricted stock rather than deferred stock as described above. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging up to six years , and in some cases upon retirement. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 73 A summary of restricted stock activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Unvested, January 1, 2019 396 $ 92 1.3 Granted 236 84 Vested ( 150 ) 76 Forfeited ( 36 ) 93 Unvested, December 31, 2019 446 $ 97 1.5 Granted 200 $ 92 Vested ( 145 ) 95 Forfeited ( 17 ) 93 Unvested, December 31, 2020 484 $ 94 1.4 Granted 208 $ 87 Vested ( 124 ) 106 Forfeited ( 23 ) 84 Unvested, December 31, 2021 545 $ 85 1.3 $ 53 During 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were 7,764 , 7,208 and 7,407 , respectively, shares of restricted stock granted to our non-employee directors, all of which are vested except for 1,258 shares granted in 2021 that were cancelled. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $ 15.6 , $ 15.7 and $ 15.5 , respectively, of expense related to restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2021, there was $ 13.1 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. Performance Share Units Our 2011 Plan allows us to grant performance share units. We grant performance share units with a performance period ranging from one to three years . Vesting of units occurs at the end of the performance period or after a subsequent holding period, except in the case of termination of employment where the units are forfeited immediately. Upon retirement, a prorated number of units vest depending on the period worked from the grant date to retirement date or in certain cases all of the units vest. In the case of death or disability, the units immediately vest at the Target Award level if the death or disability date is during the performance period, or at the level determined by the performance criteria met during the performance period if the death or disability occurs during the subsequent holding period. The units are settled in shares of our common stock. A payout multiple may be applied to the units awarded based on the performance criteria determined by the People, Culture and Compensation Committee (formerly the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee) of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. In the event the performance criteria exceeds the Target Award level, an additional number of shares, up to the Outstanding Award level, may be granted. In the event the performance criteria falls below the Target Award level, a reduced number of shares, as low as the Threshold Award level, may be granted. If the performance criteria falls below the Threshold Award level, no shares will be granted. 74 A summary of the performance share units detail by grant year is as follows: 2018 2019 2020 2021 2021 Grant Date(s) February 15, 2018 February 15, 2019 February 14, 2020 February 12, 2021 February 12, 2021 Performance Period (years) 2018-2020 2019-2021 2020-2022 2021-2022 2021 Vesting Date (1) February 2021 February 2022 February 2023 February 2023 February 2024 Payout Levels (in units): Threshold Award 42,361 61,381 59,698 39,882 61,076 Target Award 84,726 122,761 119,395 79,763 122,152 Outstanding Award 169,452 245,522 238,790 159,526 244,304 Shares Issued in 2021 42,365 — — — — Payout Achieved Over Performance Period — 81,700 — — — (1) Awards are scheduled to vest after the People, Culture and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the achievement of the performance criteria. We recognize and adjust compensation expense based on the likelihood of the performance criteria specified in the award being achieved. The compensation expense is recognized over the performance and holding periods and is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. We have recognized total compensation expense of $ 16.3 , $ 3.7 and $ 5.2 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the performance share units. The higher expense in 2021 resulted from a combination of higher estimated payout levels and an additional special grant issued in 2021. (4) Acquisitions and Dispositions ettain group Acquisition On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 930.9 . Of the total consideration paid, $ 925.0 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 5.9 was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $ 150.0 draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. We expect to finalize the net working capital adjustments in 2022. The acquisition of ettain group was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of ettain group were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. 75 The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2021: Cash and cash equivalents $ 14.6 Accounts receivable 132.2 Prepaid expenses and other assets 6.3 Operating lease right-of-use asset 8.7 Goodwill 519.6 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 360.0 Accounts payable ( 40.5 ) Employee compensation payable ( 15.0 ) Accrued liabilities ( 7.9 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 11.2 ) Value added taxes payable ( 12.2 ) Long-term operating lease liability ( 5.9 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 17.8 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 930.9 The customer relationship intangible asset will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $ 354.0 and $ 519.6 , respectively. The goodwill is included within the United States reporting unit and is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies to occur post-acquisition as a result of diversifying the business into higher growth and higher value services. ettain group contributed revenues from services of $ 182.7 since the acquisition. Our consolidated unaudited proforma historical revenues from services and net earnings, as if ettain group had been acquired at the beginning of 2020, are estimated as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Revenues from services $ 21,269.1 $ 18,731.0 Net earnings 425.4 40.1 The proforma amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the results of ettain group to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming fair value adjustment to intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2020, with the consequential tax effects. In 2021, we incurred $ 18.8 of acquisition and integration costs. These expenses are included in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and are reflected in proforma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the table above. We expect to finalize our accounting for the ettain group acquisition during the first half of 2022, upon finalization of the accounting for income tax related items and working capital adjustments. Switzerland Acquisitions On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 219.5 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 161.2 was for cash and cash equivalents. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. 76 Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The total cash impact of the acquisition was an inflow of $ 98.0 , net of cash acquired of $ 317.5 . In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 80.4 , $ 32.5 represented foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest from accumulated other comprehensive loss. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of April 3, 2019: Cash and cash equivalents $ 317.5 Accounts receivable 60.4 Prepaid expenses and other assets 31.4 Goodwill 33.8 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 19.6 Intangible assets not subject to amortization, reacquired franchise rights 25.5 Property and equipment 0.4 Accounts payable ( 21.6 ) Employee compensation payable ( 2.5 ) Accrued liabilities ( 9.9 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 7.5 ) Value added taxes payable ( 7.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 24.6 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 415.1 Other Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding ettain group, Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 8.1 , $ 2.6 and $ 47.7 , respectively. The 2021, 2020 and 2019 balances include consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 6.3 , $ 1.9 and $ 13.0 , respectively, had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2021 acquisitions, excluding ettain group, were $ 3.1 and $ 0.6 . No goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in 2020. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2019 acquisitions, excluding Manpower Switzerland, were $ 14.2 and $ 9.0 , respectively. 77 ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited Disposition On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51 % controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25 % of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25 %, and then further diluted to 36.87 % as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $ 30.4 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the $ 30.4 was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $ 6.2 related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive loss. Other Dispositions Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations in order to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. In November 2021, we disposed of our Tunisia business in our Southern Europe segment and recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $1.2, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 30, 2020, we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for $ 5.8 subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $ 5.8 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2020. (5) Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Current United States Federal $ 20.2 $ 5.2 $ 16.7 State 3.3 4.5 2.5 Non-United States 163.5 124.6 243.6 Total current 187.0 134.3 262.8 Deferred United States Federal 5.8 ( 11.0 ) ( 22.1 ) State 2.4 ( 4.9 ) 1.1 Non-United States ( 9.5 ) 5.5 ( 22.0 ) Total deferred ( 1.3 ) ( 10.4 ) ( 43.0 ) Total provision $ 185.7 $ 123.9 $ 219.8 78 A tax reconciliation between taxes computed at the United States federal statutory rate of 21 % and the consolidated effective tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Income tax based on statutory rate $ 119.3 $ 31.0 $ 143.9 Increase (decrease) resulting from: Non-United States tax rate difference: French business tax (1) 26.7 43.7 54.9 Other (2) 22.2 9.7 37.3 Repatriation of non-United States earnings 5.7 ( 2.0 ) ( 17.8 ) State income taxes, net of federal benefit 5.0 ( 1.3 ) 3.1 Change in valuation allowance (3) 22.0 48.5 20.0 Work Opportunity Tax Credit (4) ( 10.9 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 10.4 ) Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction ( 10.7 ) ( 8.8 ) ( 11.9 ) Goodwill impairment (5) — 13.4 11.9 Gain related to Manpower Switzerland and Greater China transactions (6) — — ( 22.8 ) Other, net 6.4 ( 5.4 ) 11.6 Tax provision $ 185.7 $ 123.9 $ 219.8 79 Deferred income taxes are recorded based on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Temporary differences, which give rise to the deferred taxes, are as follows: December 31 2021 2020 Future Income Tax Benefits (Expense) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance $ 22.5 $ 32.2 Employee compensation payable 38.9 26.2 Pension and postretirement benefits 77.9 79.1 Intangible assets ( 135.7 ) ( 113.6 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings ( 16.1 ) ( 10.0 ) Loans denominated in foreign currencies — 13.5 Operating lease ROU assets ( 96.3 ) ( 106.2 ) Operating lease liabilities 99.5 112.0 Net operating losses 129.4 136.2 Other 163.9 127.9 Valuation allowance ( 167.1 ) ( 149.4 ) Total future tax benefits $ 116.9 $ 147.9 Deferred tax asset $ 135.0 $ 165.7 Deferred tax liability ( 18.1 ) ( 17.8 ) Total future tax benefits $ 116.9 $ 147.9 Pre-tax earnings of non-United States operations were $ 433.6 , $ 86.3 and $ 416.6 in 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on $ 343.8 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested. We have not estimated the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine or immaterial to the financial statements. As of December 31, 2021 , deferred taxes for non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $ 1,473.3 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 16.1 and $ 10.0 , respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We had United States federal and non-United States net operating loss carryforwards and United States state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 644.7 and $ 161.9 , respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: United States Federal and Non-United States United States State 2022 $ 2.7 $ 5.4 2023 2.7 8.5 2024 5.3 38.6 2025 5.5 5.3 2026 1.0 9.9 Thereafter 7.5 70.6 No expirations 620.0 23.6 Total net operating loss carryforwards $ 644.7 $ 161.9 We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $ 129.4 as of December 31, 2021 , for the benefit of these net operating losses. Realization of this asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards. A related valuation allowance of $ 115.1 was recorded as of December 31, 2021, as management believes that realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is unlikely. 80 We had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 71.8 , $ 64.5 and $ 69.5 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $6.0. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next year. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We accrued net interest and penalties of $ 0.9 , $ 0.0 and $ 1.6 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2021, 2020 and 2019: 2021 2020 2019 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 60.9 $ 65.9 $ 32.2 Increases in prior year tax positions 4.6 1.4 35.7 Decreases in prior year tax positions ( 0.4 ) ( 4.1 ) ( 2.6 ) Increases for current year tax positions 9.0 3.2 4.7 Expiration of statute of limitations and audit settlements ( 6.8 ) ( 5.5 ) ( 4.1 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 67.3 $ 60.9 $ 65.9 Potential interest and penalties 4.5 3.6 3.6 Balance, end of year $ 71.8 $ 64.5 $ 69.5 We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2014 through 2021 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2021 , we were subject to tax audits in Austria, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (6) Net Earnings Per Share The calculation of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Net earnings available to common shareholders: $ 382.4 $ 23.8 $ 465.7 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions): Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 54.5 58.0 59.9 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.2 — — Effect of other share-based awards 0.7 0.3 0.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 55.4 58.3 60.3 Net earnings per share - basic $ 7.01 $ 0.41 $ 7.78 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 6.91 $ 0.41 $ 7.72 There were 0.1 million, 0.6 million and 0.4 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 81 (7) Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total (4) Balance, January 1, 2020 $ 535.6 $ 144.8 $ 374.6 $ 79.1 $ 126.0 $ 1,260.1 Impairment charge (5) — — ( 66.8 ) — — ( 66.8 ) Currency impact and other 1.0 10.1 18.8 2.6 — 32.5 Balance, December 31, 2020 536.6 154.9 326.6 81.7 126.0 1,225.8 Acquisitions 522.7 — — — — 522.7 Currency impact and other ( 0.4 ) ( 8.2 ) ( 12.9 ) ( 4.8 ) — ( 26.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1,058.9 $ 146.7 $ 313.7 $ 76.9 $ 126.0 $ 1,722.2 Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: December 31 2021 2020 United States $ 1,091.7 $ 545.7 Netherlands 112.2 119.3 United Kingdom 110.7 100.2 France 74.3 73.3 Sweden 41.4 43.6 Other reporting units (1) 291.9 343.7 Total goodwill $ 1,722.2 $ 1,225.8 (1) As of July 1, 2021, balances pertaining to Right Management were allocated to corresponding reporting units . (8) Debt Information concerning short-term borrowings is as follows: December 31 2021 2020 Short-term borrowings $ 16.8 $ 20.4 Weighted-average interest rates 7.6 % 7.9 % We maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2021 , such uncommitted credit lines totaled $ 338.6 , of which $ 314.9 was unused. Under our revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $ 300.0 in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $ 600.0 in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $ 276.3 could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2021. 82 A summary of long-term debt is as follows: December 31 2021 2020 Euro-denominated notes: € 500.0 due June 2026 $ 565.2 $ 606.7 € 400.0 due September 2022 454.4 487.8 Revolving Credit Agreement 75.0 — Other 6.9 9.0 1,101.5 1,103.5 Less current maturities 535.8 — Long-term debt $ 565.7 $ 1,103.5 Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold € 500.0 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750 % notes due June 2026 (the “€ 500.0 notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 notes of € 495.7 were used to repay our € 350.0 notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 notes were issued at a price of 99.564 % to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809 %. Interest on the €500.0 notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our € 400.0 aggregate principal amount 1.875 % notes (the ""€400.0 notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $ 600.0 revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets upon replacement of either the €500.0 notes or the €400.0 notes. Both the € 500.0 notes and € 400.0 notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2021. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement We have a Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of June 18, 2023 . The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $ 600.0 in various currencies, and up to $ 150.0 may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had $ 75.0 in borrowings under this facility as of December 31, 2021 and no borrowings as of December 31, 2020. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totale d $ 0.5 as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Additional borrowings of $ 524.5 and $ 599.5 we re available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. 83 The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. Debt Maturities The maturities of long-term debt payable within each of the four years subsequent to December 31, 2022 are as follows: 2023 - $ 0.0 , 2024 - $ 0.0 , 2025 - $ 0.0 , 2026 - $ 565.2 . (9) Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans For all of our United States defined benefit and retiree health care plans, we adopted the Society of Actuaries’ Pri-2012 Mortality Table with MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale in determining the plans’ benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. In 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (“PBGC”) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The standard PBGC audit was completed in March 2021, and the remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement are being utilized to fund qualified 401(k) plan contributions in current and future years. In our Switzerland pension plan, we recognized a partial settlement as a result of local regulations and turnover common to our industry and reclassified pension losses of $ 1.0 and $ 2.7 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 84 The reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans are as follows. The actuarial (gain) loss related to the non-United States plans' benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021, was primarily related to changes in discount rates. The settlements and transfers of the non-United States plans in 2021 represent transfers in and out of temporary associates within our Switzerland plan. United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 28.5 $ 52.8 $ 965.6 $ 794.8 Service cost — — 22.0 21.0 Interest cost 0.4 0.8 5.7 8.6 Settlements — ( 22.3 ) ( 61.7 ) ( 42.2 ) Transfers — — 52.8 27.0 Actuarial (gain) loss ( 0.6 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 47.3 ) 90.9 Plan participant contributions — — 14.1 11.6 Benefits paid ( 2.3 ) ( 2.4 ) ( 12.8 ) ( 13.2 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — ( 40.5 ) 67.1 Benefit obligation, end of year $ 26.0 $ 28.5 $ 897.9 $ 965.6 United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ — $ 38.8 $ 753.6 $ 655.4 Actual return on plan assets — 0.1 24.3 49.7 Settlements — ( 22.3 ) ( 61.7 ) ( 42.2 ) Transfers — — 52.8 26.2 Plan participant contributions — — 14.1 11.6 Company contributions 2.3 ( 14.2 ) 18.7 16.1 Benefits paid ( 2.3 ) ( 2.4 ) ( 12.8 ) ( 13.2 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — ( 26.5 ) 50.0 Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ — $ — $ 762.5 $ 753.6 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 26.0 ) $ ( 28.5 ) $ ( 135.4 ) $ ( 211.9 ) Amounts Recognized Noncurrent assets $ — $ — $ 51.2 $ 32.1 Current liabilities ( 2.3 ) ( 2.4 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 1.2 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 23.7 ) ( 26.1 ) ( 185.8 ) ( 242.8 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 26.0 ) $ ( 28.5 ) $ ( 135.4 ) $ ( 211.9 ) Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consisted of: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net loss $ 7.8 $ 8.6 $ 41.8 $ 95.2 Prior service cost — — 7.1 7.6 Total $ 7.8 $ 8.6 $ 48.9 $ 102.8 85 The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $ 891.7 and $ 957.0 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The ABO for plans that have plan assets was $ 787.5 and $ 841.6 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2021 2020 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 181.8 $ 491.5 Plan assets 99.4 368.8 In 2021, one of our larger plans became additionally funded and its plan assets exceeded its accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021. As a result, this plan was included in the amounts disclosed above for 2020 but not for 2021. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $ 923.9 and $ 994.1 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The PBO for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2021 2020 Projected benefit obligation $ 188.3 $ 503.2 Plan assets 99.4 368.8 By their nature, certain of our plans do not have plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for these plans was $ 104.2 and $ 115.4 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The components of the net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for all plans were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost $ 22.0 $ 21.0 $ 15.1 Interest cost 6.1 9.4 12.7 Expected return on assets ( 12.2 ) ( 13.5 ) ( 12.9 ) Settlements 1.0 13.8 0.4 Net loss 4.6 2.7 1.2 Prior service cost 0.7 0.7 0.7 Net periodic benefit cost 22.2 34.1 17.2 Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligation Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net (gain) loss ( 60.0 ) 44.1 45.5 Prior service cost — 0.4 1.0 Amortization of net loss ( 5.6 ) ( 6.3 ) ( 1.6 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss ( 66.3 ) 37.5 44.2 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ ( 44.1 ) $ 71.6 $ 61.4 The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the benefit obligation were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.6 % 2.1 % 1.0 % 0.6 % Rate of compensation increase 1.3 % — % 1.7 % 1.7 % 86 The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Discount rate 2.1 % 2.5 % 4.2 % 0.6 % 1.1 % 1.8 % Expected long-term return on plan assets N/A N/A 4.3 % 1.8 % 2.2 % 2.7 % Rate of compensation increase — % — % 3.0 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans N/A N/A N/A 1.9 % 2.0 % 2.0 % We determine our assumption for the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. Our overall expected long-term rate of return used in the measurement of the 2021 net periodic benefit cost on non-United States plans varied by country and ranged from ( 0.1 )% to 3.0 %. For a majority of our plans, a building block approach has been employed to establish this return. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income instruments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. We also use guaranteed insurance contracts for four of our foreign plans. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected rate of return. None of our United States plans had plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 due to the settlement of the Qualified Retirement Plan liability during the first quarter of 2020. Projected salary levels utilized in the determination of the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans are based upon historical experience and the future expectations for each respective country. Our plans’ investment policies are to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Our long-term objective is to minimize plan expenses and contributions by outperforming plan liabilities. We have historically used a balanced portfolio strategy based primarily on a target allocation of equity securities and fixed-income instruments, which vary by location. These target allocations, which are similar to the 2021 allocations, are determined based on the favorable risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted within a specified range to advance our overall objective. The fair values of our Level 1 and Level 2 pension plan assets are primarily determined by using market quotes and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Insurance contracts and annuity contracts are measured at the present value of expected future benefit payments primarily using associated interest curves. Hedge funds consist of a number of diversified funds including those investing in international securities, equity and private partnership interests valued using market available data and various models and assumptions. 87 The fair value of our pension plan assets by asset category was as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents $ 18.8 $ 18.8 $ — $ — Equity securities: Mutual funds 141.5 141.5 — — Common stock 37.7 37.7 — — Fixed income instruments: Fixed income funds 175.0 — 175.0 — Annuity contract 51.7 — — 51.7 Bonds 44.9 — 44.9 — Guaranteed insurance contracts 21.3 — 21.3 — Other types of investments: Insurance contracts 129.6 — — 129.6 Real estate funds 102.1 — 100.8 1.3 Hedge funds 29.2 — 12.6 16.6 Other 10.7 — 3.4 7.3 $ 762.5 $ 198.0 $ 358.0 $ 206.5 Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents $ 16.1 $ 16.1 $ — $ — Equity securities: Mutual funds 116.1 116.1 — — Common stock 25.4 25.4 — — Fixed income instruments: Fixed income funds 185.6 — 185.6 — Annuity contract 56.2 — — 56.2 Bonds 41.4 — 41.4 — Guaranteed insurance contracts 21.0 — 21.0 — Other types of investments: Insurance contracts 157.8 — — 157.8 Real estate funds 92.1 — 90.8 1.3 Hedge funds 32.0 — 11.4 20.6 Other 9.9 — 3.2 6.7 $ 753.6 $ 157.6 $ 353.4 $ 242.6 88 The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the pension assets that are measured using Level 3 inputs. We determined that transfers between fair-value-measurement levels occurred on the date of the event that caused the transfer.

Due to the nature of the plan, there are no plan assets. The reconciliation of the changes in the plan’s benefit obligation and the statement of the funded status of the plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 14.6 $ 14.1 Interest cost 0.2 0.4 Actuarial loss 0.1 1.0 Benefits paid ( 0.8 ) ( 0.9 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 14.1 $ 14.6 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 14.1 ) $ ( 14.6 ) Amounts Recognized Current liabilities $ ( 1.2 ) $ ( 1.1 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 12.9 ) ( 13.5 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 14.1 ) $ ( 14.6 ) The amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consists of a net loss of $ 2.2 and $ 2.3 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, and a prior service credit of $ 2.3 and $ 2.9 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of the benefit obligation was 2.6 % and 2.2 % in 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of net periodic benefit cost was 2.2 %, 3.0 % and 4.2 % in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 89 The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for this plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Net Periodic Benefit Credit Interest cost $ 0.2 $ 0.4 $ 0.5 Net loss 0.2 0.1 — Prior service credit ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) Net periodic benefit credit $ ( 0.4 ) $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.3 ) Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net loss $ 0.2 $ 1.1 $ 0.8 Amortization of net loss ( 0.2 ) ( 0.1 ) — Amortization of prior service credit 0.8 0.8 0.8 Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss 0.8 1.8 1.6 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ 0.4 $ 1.5 $ 1.3 The estimated net loss and prior service credit for the retiree health care plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income/loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2022 are $ 0.2 and $ 0.8 , respectively. The health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 6.4 % for 2022 , decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 % in 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates are not expected to have a material effect on the amounts reported. Future Contributions and Payments During 2022 , we plan to contribute approximately $ 15.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Projected benefit payments from the plans as of December 31, 2021 were estimated as follows: Year Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2022 $ 71.8 $ 1.1 2023 45.0 1.1 2024 34.2 1.1 2025 29.1 1.0 2026 29.5 1.1 2027–2030 158.1 4.7 Total projected benefit payments $ 367.7 $ 10.1 Defined Contribution Plans and Deferred Compensation Plans We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all permanent United States employees and various other employees throughout the world. With our company-sponsored plans, employees may elect to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans and we match a portion of their contributions up to a maximum percentage of the employee’s salary. In addition, profit sharing contributions are made if a targeted earnings level is reached at management’s discretion. The total expense for our match and any profit sharing contributions was $ 17.3 , $ 16.6 and $ 16.9 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. In certain countries with statutory defined contribution plans, we pay a percentage of the employees' salary in pension premiums. The total expense for the statutory defined contribution plans was $ 32.2 , $ 27.5 and $ 32.1 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 90 We also have deferred compensation plans in the United States. One of the plans had an asset and liability of $ 136.9 and $ 118.4 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, with the remaining plans holding immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities. (10) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: December 31 2021 2020 Foreign currency translation $ ( 180.8 ) $ ( 72.1 ) Translation loss on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 16.4 ) and $( 34.9 ), respectively ( 18.4 ) ( 81.2 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 133.6 ) ( 133.3 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income benefit of $( 22.8 ) and $( 38.2 ), respectively ( 56.7 ) ( 111.4 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.6 and $ 1.8 , respectively 0.1 0.7 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 389.4 ) $ ( 397.3 ) (11) Interest and Other Expenses (Income), Net Interest and other expenses (income), net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 38.8 $ 43.3 $ 44.4 Interest income ( 12.0 ) ( 13.1 ) ( 6.0 ) Foreign exchange loss 5.2 4.9 6.7 Miscellaneous (income) expenses, net (1) ( 14.7 ) 4.8 ( 85.7 ) Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 17.3 $ 39.9 $ ( 40.6 ) (12) Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. 91 The € 400.0 ( $ 454.4 ) note s due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ( $ 565.2 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2021. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on OCI for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 was as follows: (Loss) Gain Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2021 2020 Euro Notes $ 76.1 $ ( 90.3 ) Cross-currency swaps 6.7 ( 23.0 ) Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019, we entered into to a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We apply the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on OCI, AOCL and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020: (Loss) Gain Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCL into Income Year Ended December 31, Location of Gain Reclassified Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2021 2020 from AOCL into Income 2021 2020 Cross-currency swaps $ 11.8 $ 1.4 Interest and other expenses (income), net $ ( 13.7 ) $ 1.1 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains and losses included in AOCL at December 31, 2021 to be reclassified into earnings to approximate $ 10.0 over the next 12 months. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings will vary due to future currency exchange rates. 92 Non-Designated Instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ ( 11.6 ) $ 1.1 Derivative and Non-Derivative Assets and Liabilities The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, and 2020: Assets December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 24.7 $ 12.1 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net — 1.0 Total instruments $ 24.7 $ 13.1 Liabilities December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2022 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt $ 454.4 $ 1,094.5 Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt $ 565.2 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 24.2 30.5 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 5.5 — Total instruments $ 1,049.3 $ 1,125.0 The fair value measurements of these items recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 93 (13) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease expense $ 140.8 $ 143.1 $ 153.5 Short-term lease expense 6.0 11.3 17.6 Other lease expense (1) 20.4 16.7 15.8 Total lease expense $ 167.2 $ 171.1 $ 186.9 (1) Other lease expense includes variable lease expense and sublease income.

Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, outplacement services, talent management services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 95 Total assets for the segments are reported after the elimination of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany accounts.

We record accruals for loss contingencies based on the circumstances of each claim, when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition. Guarantees We have entered into certain guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $ 769.3 as of December 31, 2021 ($ 717.7 for guarantees and $ 51.6 for stand-by letters of credit). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. 99 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acco untants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. The internal control over financial reporting for the ettain group business was excluded from the evaluation the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021 because it was acquired in a purchase business combination on October 1, 2021. The total assets and total revenues acquired in the acquisition of ettain group represent approximately 10% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the ettain business. We excluded ettain from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because it was acquired in a purchase business combination on October 1, 2021. The total assets and total revenues acquired in the acquisition of ettain represent approximately 10% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 100 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Operations Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. When demand drops, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline at the same pace as revenues. In periods of economic contraction, we may have more significant expense deleveraging, as we believe it is prudent not to reduce selling and administrative expenses to levels that could negatively impact the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. 4 The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with a days sales outstanding of approximately 54 day s as December 31, 2020 . Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, as we saw starting in late March 2020 and continuing throughout 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. During 2020, we were highly successful in receivable collections while incurring lower payroll costs on lower activity. Our improved cash flow also benefited from certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis, largely in the United States, France, and Italy, with some of the benefits maturing in the second half of 2020. The impact of the remaining benefits is expected to mature in 2021, and we expect lower levels of operating cash flow during 2021. Due to our industry’s sensitivity to economic factors, the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short-term nature of staffing assignments, it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with certainty. As a result, we monitor a number of economic indicators, as well as recent business trends, to predict future revenue trends for each of the countries and territories where we operate. Based upon these anticipated trends, we determine what level of personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities. During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have helped drive demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the global economy continues to grow and adapt with new technology, we are helping clients manage their workforce transformation and ensure they have the right skills now and in the future. Whether it is through workforce assessments, targeted training or by creating longer-term development paths, we help organizations and candidates adapt their skills to changing workforce needs. Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and industrial positions. These services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for over 70 years with a primary focus on the areas of office and industrial services and solutions. Our Talent Based Outsourcing offering within our Manpower brand includes outcome-based solutions such as management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities. We provide services under our Experis brand, particularly in the areas of IT, Engineering, and Finance, that include high-impact solutions, and help accelerate organizations’ growth by attracting, assessing and placing candidates with specialized expertise to deliver in-demand skills for important positions. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates’ workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our Experis brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise or continue. Our Proservia offering within the Experis brand includes outcome-based solutions specializing in infrastructure management and end-user support. Our Talent Solutions brand specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and new solutions and creating added value that addresses our clients’ complex global workforce needs. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through exclusive outsourcing contracts. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative 5 functions. Our Right Management offering includes our career management services that have historically been counter-cyclical to our staffing services, which helps to offset the impact of an economic downturn on our overall financial results. Americas We provide services as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The Americas segment had 490 branch and 182 franchise offices as of December 31, 2020. In the United States, where we realized 61% of the Americas’ revenue, we had 318 branch and 175 franchise offices as of December 31, 2020, as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico, Canada and Argentina, we had 172 branch offices and 7 franchise offices as of December 31, 2020. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise. Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower® service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchisee sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise. Our Manpower and Experis operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. During 2020 in this segment, approximately 35% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 25% from placing office staff, and 40% from placing professional and technical staff. For our United States operations in 2020, approximately 46% of the temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 12% from placing office staff, and 42% from placing professional and technical staff.

The employment services market in France calls for a wide range of our services including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. The temporary recruitment market is predominantly focused on recruitment for industrial positions. In 2020, we derived approximately 84% of our temporary recruitment revenues in France from the supply of industrial and construction workers, 15% from the supply of office staff, and 1% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In Italy, we are a leading workforce solutions and services provider. As of December 31, 2020, ManpowerGroup Italy conducted operations through a network of 211 branch offices. It provides a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis or Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. In 2020, approximately 66% of our temporary and contract recruitment revenues in Italy were derived from placing industrial staff, 6% from placing office staff, including contact center staff, and 28% from placing professional and technical staff. 6 Northern Europe Our largest operations in Northern Europe are in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics and the Netherlands, providing a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services through Manpower, Experis, and Talent Solutions. Collectively, we operate through 379 branch offices in this region. During 2020 for our Northern Europe operations, approximately 38% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 22% from placing office staff, and 40% from placing professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, where we have the largest operation in this segment, we are a leading provider of workforce solutions and services. As of December 31, 2020, we conducted operations in the United Kingdom as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through a network of 61 branch offices and also provided on-site services to clients who have significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. During 2020, approximately 26% of our United Kingdom operation’s temporary recruitment revenues were derived from the supply of industrial staff, 16% from the supply of office staff, and 58% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, we also conduct operations as Brook Street Bureau PLC, or Brook Street. Its core business is secretarial, office and light industrial recruitment. Brook Street operates as a local network of branches and competes primarily with local or regional independents. Brook Street’s revenues are comprised of temporary and contract placements as well as permanent recruitment. APME We operate through 136 branch offices in the Asia Pacific Middle East (APME) region. The largest of these operations are located in Japan, Australia, India and Korea, all of which operate through branch offices. Our APME operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. During 2020, approximately 8% of our APME temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 61% from placing office staff, and 31% from placing professional and technical staff. On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining 36.87% interest under the equity method of accounting. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information.) Competition We compete in the employment services industry by offering a broad range of services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, project-based workforce solutions, assessment and selection, training, career and talent management, managed service solutions, outsourcing, consulting and professional services. Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of United States dollars in annual revenues. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. In addition to us, the largest publicly owned companies specializing in recruitment services are The Adecco Group and Randstad. We also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies such as Recruit Holdings, Kelly Services, Robert Half, Kforce, PageGroup, Korn/Ferry International and Alexander Mann. It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the increasing demand for skilled people, employers’ desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including several of the employment services industry’s most recognized and respected brands; geographic diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and high-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions. 7 Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, and large national and multinational client relationships, which comprised approximately 60% of our revenues in 2020. Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses are based on a local or regional relationship, and tend to rely less on longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. The large national and multinational clients, on the other hand, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to local managers. As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed. Legal Regulations The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: • regulation of the employer/employee relationship between the firm and its temporary and contract employees; • registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements; • substantive limitations on the operations or the use of temporary and contract employees by clients; and • regulation that requires new or additional benefits and pay parity for our associates. In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us. In most countries, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, health and other benefits, anti-discrimination and workers’ compensation, govern the firm. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement. In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination. Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subject to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission’s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises. Changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which workforce solutions and services firms may operate. These changes could impose additional costs, taxes, record keeping or reporting requirements; restrict the tasks to which contingent workers may be assigned; limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the relationship (with us or the client); or otherwise adversely affect the industry. 8 Trademarks We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries and territories. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup ® , Manpower ® , Experis ® , Right Management ® , Brook Street ® , Proservia ® , and MyPath ® have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Employees We had approximately 25,000 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we recruit millions of permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year on behalf of our clients. As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees. Human Capital We are a workforce solutions and human capital company. Our purpose is to provide meaningful and sustainable jobs and is rooted in our values: People, Knowledge and Innovation. Our employees, spanning 75 countries and territories, help improve the lives of nearly 600,000 workers on a daily basis by providing access to employment and opportunities to reskill or upskill. These efforts support local economies and create economic opportunity for our associates. We Are Focused on Reskilling and Upskilling of Workers and Future Workers. Through our partnerships with clients and NGOs (e.g. World Economic Forum, World Employment Confederation and Junior Achievement) and our own research and solutions, we are advancing the global discussion around the skills preparedness of today’s workers and the definition of required skills for the future. Since 2016, through our Skills Revolution series, we have highlighted how technology and digitization could shift in-demand skills, exacerbate existing talent shortages and require investments to reskill and upskill workers. In response to emerging trends, we launched our MyPath program, with the intent of connecting our associates to opportunities that can advance their skills and meet employers’ needs. Through this program, ManpowerGroup provides personalized guidance, career development, training, and access to jobs. Primarily focused in growth sectors including information technology, sales and finance, MyPath helped approximately 60,000 associates per month as of the end of 2020, representing our Manpower and Experis brands in 12 countries. We also provide free access to online learning to all associates on assignment. In 2020, we expanded our online learning platform, including partnering with University of Phoenix, resulting in an increase in associate usage by 15%. We Are Focused on Our Diversity, Our People and Our Culture. Even though we have a global footprint, our teams are managed locally, with 29% of our people in the Americas, 33% in Southern Europe, 23% in Northern Europe and 16% in Asia Pacific/Middle East. Collectively, we are focused on advancing diversity, developing our people and assessing our culture to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace and the workplace. • Advancing Diversity: Our focus on diversity encompasses three parts: (1) globally, support gender diversity at leadership levels; (2) locally, address a second dimension of diversity based on gaps or opportunities within a country; and (3) culturally, foster an inclusive environment that promotes well-being and personal achievement. We believe that diversity starts at the top, hence our focus on leadership levels. Our Board of Directors is 38% women and 23% people of color. Our Executive Leadership Team, which reports directly to 9 the CEO, is 27% women and 36% of people of color. Our global leadership team, the top ninety-four leaders of the company, is 31% women. In North America, our second diversity dimension is race. In 2020, as the United States faced racial unrest, our North American team launched our Courageous Conversations series; established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council led by the Regional President; leveraged internal business resource groups as advisors, and with their input developed new training for our employees and our clients; and partnered with local business leaders to facilitate community discussions and develop plans of action. • Developing our People : We have increased our focus on learning through internal campaigns, curated self-directed learning and through our Sales Academies and our Talent Agent program, which provides skills enhancement to recruiters to foster career advancement. To date, we have trained 2,700 recruiters and 1,345 salespeople. We have also launched a new mobile learning platform that makes on-the-go micro-courses accessible to our employees. Our employees completed nearly 65,000 of these courses in 2020. We believe that our success is contingent upon the development of our next generation of leaders. In 2019, we launched the third cohort for our Emerging Leadership Experience Program. This program identifies emerging leaders who have worked for the company for five or more years and have potential to assume greater responsibility. The two-year program provides development through our three Es approach: Education, Exposure and Experience, which includes Harvard Business School Online coursework as well as mentoring from our most senior leaders. • Assessing our Culture: Through our listening strategy, we are committed to hearing the voice of our people more than ever. For 15 years, we have tracked engagement and leadership effectiveness through our ManpowerGroup Annual People Survey (MAPS). We have improved engagement over the last three years with a 63% overall favorable rating and 78% response rate in 2020. In 2019 and in 2020, particularly in the context of COVID-19, we initiated pulse surveys to garner more in-depth feedback with greater frequency. We use insights from these surveys to assess our culture, evaluate our leaders, adjust our plans and when needed, evolve our culture. 10 Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and future adverse impacts could be material and difficult to predict. The global spread of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. The pandemic and related government actions (including declared states of emergency and quarantine, “shelter in place” or similar lockdown orders), non-governmental agency recommendations, and actions of businesses and individuals, as well as perceptions surrounding public health and safety, have resulted and are expected to continue to result in weakened economic conditions and significant economic uncertainty and volatility. These have significantly adversely affected our business, operations and financial results and we expect this will continue. 12 We are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the extent to which it will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results, which may depend on numerous factors. These include the occurrence of new outbreaks; the rate of vaccination administration; how quickly normal economic activity will resume; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services, including closure of client facilities and clients’ ability to pay for our services and solutions; increases or decreases to government restrictions and the pace at which they occur; the economic impact and adequacy of government-sponsored relief programs; and the increased risk of more infections as social interaction increases. As a result, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate effects, which could be material, of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results. Any of the effects resulting from COVID-19 could also cause, contribute to or magnify the other risks and uncertainties described below. Company and Operational Risks Our results of operations have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions. Our business is sensitive to changes in global macroeconomic conditions. Even before the onset of the pandemic, we have at times experienced uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions, including in rates of growth or decline in the markets we serve. Most of our operating countries and regions, which are increasingly interdependent, have experienced volatile growth patterns or declines, and we expect that global conditions will continue to be characterized by instability and unpredictability. Such conditions may cause our clients to reduce or to continue to defer their spending on new projects that require our solutions which could decrease demand for our various staffing services. Even if there is a recovery from COVID-related economic declines, there can be no assurances when or how rapidly this would occur and in what regions, and whether growth rates would return to pre-pandemic levels. If growth remains slow, as a result of the pandemic or otherwise, or if it continues to contract for an extended period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. In 2020, we experienced a decrease in demand and our operating profit was impacted unfavorably as we experienced a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses did not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, some clients have slowed the rate at which they pay us, or have become unable to pay their obligations and there is risk that this could continue, and our cash flow and profitability may suffer. Economic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, political volatility, civil violence and unrest, election results or other changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, trade disputes, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, social justice movements, global health crises, changes in immigration policy, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. We are particularly susceptible to changes in demand patterns and economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and 66% of our revenue. There is a risk that economic conditions in European markets may continue to be negatively impacted by events in recent years which, in addition to COVID-19, have included labor unrest, civil protest, heightened trade tensions, and uncertainty around the impacts of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated. 13 Even without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities. We may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients. There is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our diverse clients, which span all industries and whose needs may change rapidly as their businesses and industries evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 25,000 employees based out of over 2,200 offices in 75 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources to drive service improvements and to provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at anticipating or meeting the widely ranging needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. We could incur liabilities or suffer reputational damage from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of personal or confidential data, and our use of data is subject to complex and ever-changing privacy and cybersecurity legal requirements that could negatively impact our business or subject us to claims and/or fines for non-compliance. In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment data, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is personal data and/or confidential data. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, use or loss of personal data and/or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence or malfeasance, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy social engineering attacks, viruses, ransomware, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks. An incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal and/or confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in 14 frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We regularly engage an independent external security firm to assess our defenses to a potential cyberattack, and these assessments may uncover new or additional vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a compromise of our systems and/or a loss of personal data. In a recent evaluation, vulnerabilities were identified that could facilitate or contribute to a security incident involving personal data. The assessment firm was able to penetrate defensive protections adopted by us, as well as protections that we obtain from third party providers. We are prioritizing the resolution of security gaps that could lead to a loss of personal data or to other damage. Despite our efforts to identify and address vulnerabilities in our systems, vulnerabilities in software products used by us are disclosed by our software providers on a daily basis, and attackers grow continuously more sophisticated in their attack methods, making it impossible to give assurance that our cybersecurity efforts will be successful. There is a risk that our and our third-party vendors’ preventative security controls and practices will be inadequate to prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, or fraudulent activity, especially given that third party attacks have become more common. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, more of our employees are working from their homes or other remote locations than at any other time in our history. This transition, which occurred quickly beginning in March 2020, makes it more difficult for us to monitor their activities, the security of their work locations, insider threats, and data exfiltration. This has increased the risk of security incidents, which could include unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, as well as other types of fraudulent activity. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. The potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the potential for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and cybersecurity are subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the EU Court of Justice’s opinion in the “Schrems II” decision (which invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), as well as additional legislation in place, or expected to become effective, in various U.S. states and other countries. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, the GDPR and the CPRA impose significant new compliance obligations that add costs and operational burdens to our business with respect to our collection, use, storage and retention of personal data. Compliance with these obligations could reduce operational efficiency and increase our regulatory compliance costs, and failure to satisfy these requirements may lead to significant regulatory enforcement actions and/or large private litigation in the event of a security breach or other violation. Under the GDPR, the maximum fine can be up to 4% of a company’s global revenue, and there is no maximum penalty under the CPRA. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims and losses related to violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws or security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach. We have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption, increased costs, and reputational risk. We have increasingly outsourced important processes of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs, potential disruptions to our business operations, and reputational risk. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide important back office support. We have increasingly centralized our vendor profile so that we are reliant on a small number of vendors for highly critical corporate and technology functions. While we believe these third-party vendors provide greater efficiency and expertise, our dependence on a small number of vendors increases the risk that our business will be adversely affected if our vendors are unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Similarly, our business continuity and our margins could be 15 adversely affected if we needed to replace one of our critical vendors for performance or economic reasons. Our operations also depend significantly upon these vendors’ and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third-party vendors’ implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations, any of which could damage our reputation in the market. If we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. A loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients, which comprised approximately 60% of our revenues in 2020, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer. Our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations. Intense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients’ staffing needs. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. In many markets, we have been experiencing an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. This is especially acute for individuals with IT and other technology skills, as competition for such individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organization’s workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Our global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control. With operations in 75 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics, including COVID-19, and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. 16 Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results. Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. We believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services. From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Strategic Risks We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives. Our business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services. This includes expanding our sales in higher margin professional resourcing, such as our Experis brand in IT recruitment. There is a risk that our growth strategy in Experis may be impeded due to the scarcity of talent in the IT field, which is particularly in demand, and which may restrict our ability to fulfill customer requirements. Similarly, another aspect of our strategy to expand beyond our core staffing and employment services is through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. Our higher-margin Right Management career management services have historically performed well in periods of downturn, and it is part of our business 17 strategy that this counter-cyclical effect would help cushion our results in the event of a future period of decline. However, in the event of a downturn, there can be no assurances that the margin contribution from Right Management would increase, or that it would significantly offset other declines we might experience in the business. Additionally, our workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client’s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions. Our business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant rapid disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs. From time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets or enter into operating joint ventures. These activities involve significant risks, including: • difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, financial reporting, services and corporate culture of acquired companies; • failure of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form, to meet performance expectations, which could trigger payment obligations; • over-valuation by us of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form; • disputes that arise with sellers; • failure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies as well as regulatory requirements; • insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions; and • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. In addition, future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial 18 condition, results of operations and liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges could also occur. From time to time, there may be dispositions we undertake via sales, franchises, joint ventures or other exit activities, and we may face risks related to such transactions. From time to time we review the effectiveness of our global operations, including our global geographic footprint, and we may elect to exit certain countries or operations after analyzing their performance or their position in our overall global strategy. We have engaged in such dispositions in the past, and we expect that we will continue to dispose of portions of our business that are not meeting our performance or strategic objectives. Among other alternatives, this could take the form of a closure of a business, the contribution of the business to a joint venture, or an exit by means of a sale to, or a franchise arrangement with, a third party. There are risks and costs associated with any exit activities, which could include difficulties in the separation of operations, services or personnel, the diversion of management attention, and the disruption of our business. Any such transactions may require regulatory or governmental approvals, which could impede the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in, or liability with respect to, the divested businesses. As a result of divestiture transactions, we could incur severance charges for personnel and payments for lease and other commitments, charges from the impairment or write-off of assets, and other financial loss due to the transaction. Furthermore, there is the risk that we might lose customers, in particular multinational clients with operations in the exited countries or operations. Additionally, if we choose to enter into a franchise arrangement for a third party to operate our business in the exited region using our trademarks and other licensed assets, we face potential counterparty and reputational risks arising from the franchisee’s operation of the business. The reputational risks include the risk that marketplace participants, including clients, candidates and the media, may believe that we continue to control the operations of a divested or franchised business that operates utilizing our name or other trademarks. Financial and Market Risks Foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results. During 2020, approximately 87% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $1,123.9 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2020, was denominated in foreign currencies, including $1,094.5 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported results and shareholders’ equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses unless we repatriate funds. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult. We seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2020, to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted by economic conditions affecting our clients. Our working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a 19 focus on Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase, and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer. Our results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected. Our debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,123.9 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following: • we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, significant acquisition opportunities, or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing; • borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and • we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions. Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. The lenders under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, or our interest expense may increase substantially. Furthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected. 20 The performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries. Since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances. In addition, i n 2020, during the pandemic, we participated in subsidy programs of various governments. If we continue to participate in these programs, there is a risk that these programs could impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to declare dividends or repatriate cash outside of the sponsor country, which could significantly impact liquidity at the parent level if we are not able to comply with the specific country requirements. Our inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries. In a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business . In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may disagree in the future, with our judgments. Many taxing authorities are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states. Among other things, the directives require companies to provide increased country-by-country disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities, which in turn could lead to 21 disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them. These possible changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, could have an adverse impact on our current or future tax positions. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors. The market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2020, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $100.99 to a low of $49.57. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these “Risk Factors” and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: • changes in general economic conditions; • actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; • announcement of new services by us or our competitors; • announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; • changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and • changes in investor sentiment regarding the company arising from these or other events, or the economy in general. Regulatory and Legal Risks Our performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments. Our contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our clients have become more sophisticated in their contractual negotiation process and more detailed in defining their operational requirements. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners’ ability to meet our clients’ delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, including as a result of delivery challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability. Additionally, we may incur liability for the actions or omissions of our partners or vendors and we may face challenges or be unable to enforce these obligations against those partners. Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Moreover, many countries, including the Netherlands and Japan, have established regulations that require equal-pay for equal-work for temporary workers and fixed term employees. These continuously-evolving regulations could have a significant impact to our revenues, costs, and operating margins as we and customers adjust to these new regulations. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding enforcement of immigration laws, and there is a risk that we will incur greater expense in connection with immigration law compliance. The countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: • create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide; • require new or additional benefits be paid to our associates; • require pay parity for our associates; 22 • require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or • increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes. For example, in November 2020, new legislation was proposed in Mexico that could ban many types of temporary placements under the country’s labor laws. The proposal could broadly prohibit the provision of our traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for special, deliverables-based projects outside of the client’s core business activity. If this proposal were enacted into law, it could have a material adverse impact on our business in Mexico. Other types of future regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results by making it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients. Failure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business. We are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our temporary associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business. We may be exposed to legal claims, including employment-related claims that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide variety of potential litigation and other legal claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us. For example, through our direct interaction with our clients’ businesses and facilities, including functions and systems that are sensitive or critical to their core businesses, we may be exposed to operational, regulatory, reputational and other risks specific to their business, including data security risks. These risks may be reduced through contractual provisions that limit damages or mitigate our responsibility for losses caused by our assigned workers; but these types of contractual protections are not always possible because we may perceive an important economic opportunity, because of the contracting practices of our industry competitors or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities include: • claims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients; • claims by our associates of wrongful termination or retaliation; • claims arising out of the actions or inactions of our associates, including matters for which we may have indemnified a client; • claims arising from violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; • claims related to classification of workers as employees or independent contractors; • claims related to the employment of undocumented or illegal workers; • payment of workers’ compensation claims and other similar claims; 23 • violations of employee pay and benefits requirements such as violations of wage and hour requirements; • entitlement to employee benefits, including healthcare coverage; • errors and omissions of our associates and other individuals working on our behalf in performing their jobs, such as accountants, IT professionals, engineers and other technical workers; and • claims by our clients relating to our associates’ misuse of clients’ proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims. We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business regardless of the merits of the claim. For example, in the past, we have devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based “wage and hour” claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we are frequently sued by plaintiffs in various other employment-related matters, including those seeking class action status in the US. It is likely we will continue to experience similar claims in the future, which may increase in number as a result of remote working assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our business exposes us to competition law risk. We are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate. Competition law authorities have investigated our business practices in the past in France and in other countries, and there continues to be a risk of such inquiries in the future. There is no assurance we would successfully defend against any such regulatory inquiries, and they could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome could result in liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult. Certain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include: • permitting removal of directors only for cause; • providing that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and • requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees. In addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin’s “fair price” and “business combination” provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline. 24 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties We own properties at various locations worldwide, none of which are material. Most of our operations are conducted from leased premises and we do not anticipate any difficulty in renewing these leases or in finding alternative sites in the ordinary course of business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are involved in litigation of a routine nature and various legal matters, which are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 25 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF MANPOWERGROUP (as of February 17, 2021) Name of Officer Office Jonas Prising Age 56 Chairman of ManpowerGroup as of December 31, 2015.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Measures — Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included on page 39. Results of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 The financial discussion that follows focuses on 2020 results compared to 2019. For a discussion of 2019 results compared to 2018, see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Our 2020 results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, with revenues declining 13.7% compared to 2019. Our businesses experienced significant changes in revenue trends from 2019 reflecting the sudden drop of activity that started in March of 2020. Although the pandemic reduced demand for our services across almost all of our operations, the most significant portion of the year-over-year revenue decline occurred in our European markets during April and the first few weeks of May as governments put states of emergency and related lockdown requirements into place. The impact of the COVID-19 crisis stabilized in many parts of the world and economies slowly reopened as governments in some of our largest countries lifted lock-down requirements starting at the end of the second quarter. We saw some signs of a global recovery starting at the end of the third quarter that continued as a slow and steady recovery through the end of 2020, with our fourth quarter results reflecting a stronger market environment. However, a number of countries started to see increased cases of COVID-19 in the fourth quarter that led to the implementation of new restrictions in an effort to mitigate the spread. Unlike the country-wide lockdowns and restrictions experienced earlier in the year, the restrictions were more targeted and localized. Despite these restrictions, we experienced revenue growth and new opportunities in select markets as the year ended. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. The ultimate impact may depend on multiple factors which cannot be predicted, including public health conditions and the possibility of local and national governments enforcing new restrictions on commerce, which could have an adverse 31 impact on our business, or, conversely the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus packages, which could be beneficial. What started as a sudden and swift slowdown of the global economies and labor markets is expected to take longer to recover around the world than we had initially contemplated. We currently anticipate a two-tiered recovery with certain industries recovering quicker in the near term and other industries continuing to be impacted in the medium- to long-term. Compared to the impact from the COVID-19 crisis discussed above, the impact of currency on 2020 results was minimal. During 2020, the United States dollar was slightly weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets, except in Other Americas, which therefore had a favorable impact on our reported results and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 0.2% favorable impact on revenues from services, a 0.3% favorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately one cent favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During 2020, we experienced the following quarterly changes to our consolidated revenues compared to 2019: first quarter revenue decrease of 8.4% reflecting the sudden drop of activity during March as our largest markets experienced COVID-19 related work restrictions, 30.4% revenue decrease in the second quarter due to the significant impact from COVID-19 especially in April and May, improvement in the rate of decline to 12.7% in the third quarter reflecting an increase in activity levels since the lifting of lock-down requirements and restrictions, and steady improvement in the fourth quarter with a decrease of 2.7% indicating continued signs of a global recovery. Although the most dramatic revenue declines occurred in the second quarter, as European governments imposed states of emergency and related lockdowns, we continued to experience revenue declines during the third quarter on a year-over-year basis as regional economies remained at reduced activity levels as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a gradual improvement in the rates of decline throughout the third quarter of 2020 with monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 18% in July, 14% in August, and 5% in September. There was a slight increase in the rate of revenue decline in October at 9%, with gradual improvement in the remainder of the fourth quarter with a revenue decline of 3% in November and revenue growth of 5% in December. We experienced a 25.2% decrease in our permanent recruitment business in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. On an overall basis, our Talent Solutions business, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, experienced a decline in 2020 compared to 2019, which was driven by RPO activity. We experienced a sharp reduction in RPO activity as many client programs initiated hiring freezes starting in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis, although we did see improvement in the rate of year-over-year revenue decline in the second half of the year. Our MSP business has been resilient during the crisis and experienced growth in 2020 as we assisted more clients to develop customized workforce solutions during the economic downturn. Our counter-cyclical career transition services within our Right Management business experienced an increase in demand in 2020. In 2020, most of our markets experienced revenue declines due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a revenue decrease in Southern Europe, mainly driven by revenue declines in France and Italy due to the impact from the crisis. We experienced a revenue decrease in Northern Europe due to the declines in all of our key markets as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues decreased 11.4% in the Americas driven by a decrease in the United States related to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a 10.5% revenue decline in APME due to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited (“Deconsolidation”) in 2019 and the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in Japan due to an increase in demand for our staffing/interim services. Our gross profit margin in 2020 compared to 2019 decreased due to the decline in our permanent recruitment business as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and the margin decrease in our Proservia managed services business. The decrease was also due the decline in our staffing/interim margins in the Americas and Southern Europe due primarily to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business. The overall gross margin decrease was partially offset by the growth in our higher-margin MSP offering and career transition services and increase in the staffing/interim margin in APME primarily due to the improvement in Japan. 32 We recorded $110.7 million of restructuring costs in 2020, comprised of $29.5 million in the Americas, $24.5 million in Southern Europe, $52.4 million in Northern Europe, $4.1 million in APME, and $0.2 million in corporate expenses, compared to $39.8 million incurred in 2019, comprised of $9.8 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $18.7 million in Northern Europe, $4.4 million in APME, and $1.5 million in corporate expenses. Both the 2020 and 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities. The 2019 restructuring costs were also related to adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations in 2019. We recorded $72.8 million and $65.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, of goodwill and other impairment charges primarily related to our investment in Germany. In 2020, we also recorded a loss of $5.8 million from the disposition of our Serbia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Croatia businesses. Our operating profit decreased 70.9% in 2020 while our operating profit margin decreased 210 basis points compared to 2019. Excluding the restructuring costs, goodwill impairment and other charges, disposition loss and the $30.4 million gain related to the Deconsolidation in 2019, our operating profit was down 48.7% in organic constant currency with operating profit down 130 basis points compared to 2019. The decrease in operating profit margin reflects the material deleveraging that accompanied the decrease in revenues from the sustained impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We took significant actions in late March and early April, which allowed us to reduce selling and administrative expenses in our business. These reductions remained in place during the remainder of 2020, which partially offset the revenue and gross profit declines in 2020. This included leveraging government unemployment related benefits, which allowed us to move unutilized staff and associates quickly onto these programs, with most of the benefits from these actions occurring in the second quarter. There were a few programs still in place, mostly in Germany and the Netherlands, in the second half of 2020 from which we benefitted. This also included the short-term action of cutting discretionary costs and scaling operations back. In addition to these implemented initiatives, we are prepared to take further cost actions to optimize our business structure through this economic downturn with the intention of simultaneously preserving our ability to rebound when market conditions improve. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. As we manage through this crisis and prepare our business for future opportunities we would also like to emphasize the following points: • Many of our leaders have experience managing through economic downturns, and many of our senior operational leaders previously managed parts of our business during the economic downturn in 2008-2009. We believe this is valuable experience for the current economic environment. Additionally, we have enhanced our enterprise risk management framework in recent years, and we have business continuity plans which have been executed at a global, regional and country level. • The technology investments we have been making for the last few years as part of our transformational activities have facilitated a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of our full-time equivalent employees were working remotely while mitigating potential productivity losses. We have also extended our cyber and information security capability to accelerate the ability for some of our associates and consultants to work for our clients at home mitigating potential operational or financial losses. Expectations of when our full-time equivalent employees return to the workplace will depend on a number of factors including the impact such a return would have on the safety, health and well-being of our employees as well as the impact from any government mandates or restrictions. • Our business has benefitted from our diversification across geographies, industries, and offerings, that we believe position us well to endure the COVID-19 crisis. We believe this diversification may likewise position us to take advantage of market opportunities that present themselves. For example, during 2020 compared to 2019, we have seen smaller declines within our Experis business compared to the Manpower business, and we are positioned with a large portion of our business focused on providing professional services and Talent Solutions. Additionally, portions of our Talent Solutions business are assisting our clients through this downturn with customized solutions. Right Management has experienced increased demand for career transition 33 services and has historically been a counter-cyclical business that helps offset the impact of an economic downturn. Consolidated Results - 2020 compared to 2019 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2020 as compared to 2019. (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Reported Variance Variance in Constant Currency Variance in Organic Constant Currency Revenues from services $ 18,001.0 $ 20,863.5 (13.7 )% (13.9 )% (13.5 )% Cost of services 15,176.3 17,488.4 (13.2 ) (13.4 ) Gross profit 2,824.7 3,375.1 (16.3 ) (16.5 ) (15.9 ) Gross profit margin 15.7 % 16.2 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 2,570.3 2,666.2 (3.6 ) (3.8 ) Goodwill impairment charges 66.8 64.0 4.2 4.6 Selling and administrative expenses 2,637.1 2,730.2 (3.4 ) (3.6 ) (2.9 ) Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues 14.6 % 13.1 % Operating profit 187.6 644.9 (70.9 ) (71.2 ) (71.2 ) Operating profit margin 1.0 % 3.1 % Net interest expense 30.2 38.4 Other expenses (income), net 9.7 (79.0 ) Earnings before income taxes 147.7 685.5 (78.5 ) (78.7 ) Provision for income taxes 123.9 219.8 (43.7 ) Effective income tax rate 83.9 % 32.1 % Net earnings $ 23.8 $ 465.7 (94.9 ) (94.9 ) Net earnings per share - diluted $ 0.41 $ 7.72 (94.7 ) (94.8 ) Weighted average shares - diluted 58.3 60.3 (3.4 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 13.7% (-13.9% in constant currency and -13.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 14.6% (-16.7% in constant currency; -17.5% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 20.8% (-22.8% in constant currency), which was primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower staffing services and a 23.4% decrease (-24.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease also includes a decrease in Italy of 9.1% (-11.3% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 28.4% decrease (-29.8% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis; • decreased demand for services in most of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 16.0% (-16.1% in constant currency; -15.9% in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 30.0% decrease (-30.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 12.2%, 25.4%, 14.3%, 17.5% and 25.5%, respectively (-12.7%, -26.6%, -12.7%, -19.1%, and -27.0%, respectively, in constant currency); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 10.2% (-12.0% on an organic basis) primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 9.6% (-10.0% on an organic basis) decrease in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in our Talent Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering and career transition services; and 34 • a revenue decrease in APME of 10.5% (-10.5% in constant currency; -2.3% in organic constant currency) due to the Deconsolidation and a 27.4% decrease (-27.0% in constant currency; -13.5% in organic constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in revenues in Japan and an increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within the Manpower business; partially offset by • a 0.2% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 50 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 25.2% (-25.1% in constant currency and -22.4% in organic constant currency); • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact due to the margin decrease in our Proservia business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany; and • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from a deterioration in our staffing/interim margin in the Americas and Southern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business and higher rates of sickness and absenteeism in certain countries and increased direct costs associated with early termination of client contracts during the COVID-19 crisis. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by reduced direct costs in certain countries due to government crisis response programs, a direct cost accrual adjustment in France related to a payroll tax audit recorded in 2020, and our execution of various bill/pay yield initiatives due to the COVID-19 crisis; partially offset by • a 20 basis point favorable impact by growth in our higher-margin MSP offering and career transition services. The 3.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in 2020 (-3.6% in constant currency and -2.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 8.3% decrease (-8.5% in constant currency and -7.7% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs due to a reduction of salary-related costs as a result of lower headcount and a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in 2020; • a 6.7% decrease (-6.9% in constant currency and -5.6% in organic constant currency) in non-personnel related costs, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, restructuring costs, loss on disposition of subsidiaries, and gain related to Deconsolidation, due to cost management actions taken across all segments as a result of revenue declines; • the reduction in recurring selling and administrative costs of $38.9 million as a result of the Deconsolidation in 2019 and other dispositions of subsidiaries in 2019 and 2020; and • a 0.2% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • restructuring costs of $110.7 million incurred in 2020 compared to $39.8 million incurred in 2019; • the $30.4 million gain related to the Deconsolidation in 2019; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $18.2 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe and franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019; • the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges to $72.8 million in 2020 from $65.6 million in 2019; and • the $5.8 million loss on the disposition of subsidiaries in 2020. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 150 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019. The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of: • 80 basis point unfavorable impact from expense deleveraging, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, restructuring costs, and gain related to Deconsolidation, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline; • a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs in 2020 compared to 2019; 35 • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from the gain related to the Deconsolidation in 2019; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges. Interest and other expenses (income), net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses (income), net was expenses of $39.9 million in 2020 compared to income of $40.6 million in 2019. Net interest expense decreased $8.2 million in 2020 to $30.2 million from $38.4 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher cash balances. Miscellaneous expense (income), net was an expense $4.8 million in 2020 compared to income of $85.7 million in 2019. The change is primarily due to the $80.4 million gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in 2019, the pension settlement expenses of $10.2 million recorded in 2020 related to one of our United States plans and the decrease in noncontrolling interest expense as a result of a decrease in earnings in a joint venture in Germany. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 83.9% in 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 32.1% in 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, the recognition of discrete valuation allowances in Germany and the Netherlands, the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in Germany, and the French business tax. The French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in 2020 due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. The effective tax rate of 83.9% for 2020 was significantly higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the factors noted above. In 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. The 2021 rate considers the previously scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the recently enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and the extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. Net earnings per share - diluted was $0.41 in 2020 compared to $7.72 in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.01 in 2020. Restructuring costs recorded in 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.56 and $0.52 per share, net of tax, in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.14 and $1.08 per share in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pension settlement expense recorded in 2020 related to one of our United States plans negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in 2020. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in 2020. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.32 per share in 2019. The gain from the Deconsolidation recorded in 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by $0.50 per share in 2019. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased 3.4% to 58.3 million in 2020 from 60.3 million in 2019. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2020 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2019, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2020. Segment Results We evaluate performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. Effective January 2020, our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. We began reporting on the new realigned segments in the first quarter of 2020. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the new presentation. Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 11.4% (-7.6% in constant currency, -8.8% in organic constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 10.2% (-12.0% on an 36 organic basis) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 9.6% (-10.0% on an organic basis), both due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. These decreases in the United States were partially offset by increased demand for our MSP offering and career transition services. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 13.2% (-3.7% in constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. This decline was driven by decreases in Mexico, Canada, Peru, Colombia and Brazil of 15.3%, 5.6%,16.7%, 32.8% and 17.2%, respectively (-6.3%, -4.7%, -12.8%, -24.7% and increase of 7.8%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by the increase in Argentina of 5.7% (55.9% in constant currency) primarily due to inflation. Gross profit margin increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to gross profit margin increase in the United States from the increase in revenues from our higher-margin career transition services and MSP offering. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 13.6% (-12.3% in constant currency) and a decline in the staffing/interim margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues came from our lower margin enterprise clients. In 2020, selling and administrative expenses increased 0.4% (2.9% in constant currency and 1.9% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs to $29.5 million in 2020 compared to $9.8 million in 2019, the impairment charge of $6.0 million recorded in the United States related to capitalized software in 2020, a bad debt expense and a state sales tax related charge incurred 2020, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States. These increases were partially offset by decreases in salary-related costs, due to lower headcount, and discretionary expenses. OUP margin in the Americas was 3.1% and 4.8% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 2.6% for 2020 from 4.9% in 2019 primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs, the software impairment charge and expense deleveraging. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.8% in 2020 from 4.5% in 2019 primarily due to a decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased 14.6% (-16.7% in constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, revenues from services decreased 20.8% (-22.8% in constant currency) in France and decreased 9.1% (-11.3% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 23.4% (-24.6% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 28.4% (-29.8% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 2.7% (-5.2% in constant currency) during 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 32.5% (-33.1% in constant currency), both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Gross profit margin decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decline of 28.2% (-29.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and a decrease in the staffing/interim gross profit margin in France, Italy and certain countries within Other Southern Europe primarily due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business, partially offset by a direct cost accrual adjustment in France recorded in 2020. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 4.4% (-6.4% in constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, we took significant actions in France and Italy in March and April to reduce our costs to help offset the materially reduced revenues. In both France and Italy, we transitioned full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs and other initiatives and eliminated a significant amount of discretionary spend to manage through the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses in 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in certain markets that mostly 37 occurred in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease is also due to the reduction of our discretionary expenses. These decreases were offset by the increase in restructuring costs to $24.5 million in 2020 compared to $5.4 million in 2019, the loss on the disposition of subsidiaries and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 3.0% for 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 3.4% in 2020 compared to 5.2% in 2019. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 4.7% in 2020 compared to 6.8% in 2019. The decreases in France and Italy were primarily due to the decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 1.1% in 2020 compared to 3.1% in 2019, due to the decrease in the gross profit margin, the increase in restructuring costs to $24.5 million in 2020 from $3.1 million in 2019, the loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in 2020 and expense deleveraging. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 35%, 15%, 21%, 11%, and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 16.0% (-16.1% in constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 12.2%, 25.4%, 14.3%, 17.5% and 25.5% (-12.7%, -26.6%, -12.7%, -19.1% and -27.0%, respectively, in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 30.0% decrease (-30.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Gross profit margin decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business in 2020 compared to 2019, and the decline in the Experis interim margins due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues consisted of revenues from our lower-margin enterprise clients, and the margin decrease in our Proservia business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 8.2% (-8.8% in constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decrease in personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in variable incentive costs due to decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in certain markets, mostly in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease is also due to the decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices, and a reduction of our discretionary expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increase of restructuring costs to $52.4 million in 2020 from $18.7 million in 2019. Northern Europe experienced a decrease to an operating unit loss margin of (0.7%) in 2020 from an OUP margin of 1.6% in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in the gross profit margins, the increase in restructuring costs, and expense deleveraging. APME Revenues from services decreased 10.5% (-10.5% in constant currency and -2.3% in organic constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019. In Japan (which represents 45% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 8.8% (6.5% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our Talent Solutions business and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day in 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were partially offset by a 5.7% decrease (-7.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 16% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 14.6% (-13.9% in constant currency) due to the decrease in our staffing/interim revenues, as a result of our decision to exit certain low margin businesses to improve profitability and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, and the 9.4% (-8.2% in constant currency) decline in our permanent recruitment business due to the COVID-19 crisis. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the Deconsolidation, and the decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business. 38 Gross profit margin decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 27.4% (-27.0% in constant currency and -13.5% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the increase in our staffing/interim margin, mostly in Japan. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.2% (1.9% in constant currency and 15.5% in organic constant currency) in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the gain from the Deconsolidation in 2019 and an increase in costs to support the increase in revenues in certain markets. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of recurring selling and administrative costs as a result of the Deconsolidation and the decrease of restructuring costs to $4.1 million in 2020 compared to $4.4 million in 2019. OUP margin decreased to 2.9% in 2020 from 4.8% in 2019 due to the gain from the Deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2019, a decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,425.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund corporate activities. With the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we have no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2020, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $2,077.6 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $10.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We have an additional $439.0 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes as amounts are deemed indefinitely reinvested. We have not estimated the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine. Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate. Cash provided by operating activities was $936.4 million, $814.4 million and $483.1 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $703.6 million and $313.2 million of cash in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to $198.3 million utilized in 2018. The change in 2020 from 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable, due to collections and the receivables not being replaced at the same level as a result of a decrease in demand for our services, and the benefit of certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis. These improvements in our cash flows were partially offset by the decrease in our payroll-related liabilities due to lower activity. The change in 2019 from 2018 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments, a decrease in CICE receivables resulting from the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019, and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the original liability recorded at acquisition date for the acquisitions in the Netherlands. The increase was partially offset by lower net proceeds from the sale of our CICE payroll tax credits. The CICE payroll tax credits are creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2019, we sold a portion of our CICE earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $103.5 million (€92.0 million) with the remaining amount to be used against future tax payments. In April 2018, we sold substantially all of our CICE earned in 2017 for net proceeds of $234.5 million (€190.9 million). We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,901.7 million as of December 31, 2020 from $5,273.1 million as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to successful collection efforts and the revenue decline, partially offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") decreased by approximately three days from December 31, 2019 to approximately 54 days as of December 31, 2020 due to successful collection efforts and favorable mix changes, as a higher percentage of our consolidated revenues were generated in countries with a lower average DSO. Capital expenditures were $50.7 million, $52.9 million and $64.7 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs 40 related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $14.0 million in 2020, $2.0 million in 2019 and $5.6 million in 2018. The lower expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019 are primarily due to overall scale-back of activities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis, completion of a software development project in 2019, and the timing of capital expenditures, partially offset by additional technology investments. The higher expenditures in 2018 compared to 2019 was primarily due to additional technology investment and the timing of capital expenditures. On September 30, 2020 we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for $5.8 million, subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $5.8 million, which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $219.5 million and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $161.2 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate cash consideration paid reflects a post-closing settlement of net debt and net working capital adjustments of $6.8 million, which we paid out during the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $415.1 million, or $97.6 million net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million, which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million, $32.5 million represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill resulting from the Manpower Switzerland acquisition was $44.5 million and $34.2 million, respectively. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2.6 million, $47.7 million and $51.8 million, respectively. The 2020 balance includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $1.9 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2020 and 2019 balances include consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $1.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively, had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million, of which $18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2020, no goodwill and intangible assets were recognized from the 2020 acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2019 acquisitions, excluding Manpower Switzerland, were $14.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively. 41 On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25% of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25%, and then further diluted to 36.87% as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $30.4 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the $30.4 million was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $6.2 million related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive loss. Net debt payments were $38.5 million in 2020 compared to cash provided by net debt borrowings of $19.5 million and $178.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In June 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026, with the net proceeds of €495.7 million predominantly used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018. (See the ""Euro Notes"" section below for further information.) The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in August 2019, August 2018 and July 2016. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During 2020, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $264.7 million. The repurchases in 2020 occurred within the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2020. In 2019, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $203.0 million under the 2018 authorization. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 million. As of December 31, 2020, there were 3.4 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under either the 2018 or 2016 authorizations. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $2.26, $2.18 and $2.02 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $129.1 million, $129.3 million and $127.3 million, respectively. We have aggregate commitments of $2,140.8 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows: (in millions) Total 2021 2022–2023 2024–2025 Thereafter Long-term debt including interest $ 1,132.4 $ 19.9 $ 524.6 $ 21.4 $ 566.5 Short-term borrowings 20.4 20.4 — — — Operating leases 461.3 129.6 169.8 84.6 77.3 Severance and other costs 43.8 39.8 3.6 0.4 — Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act 113.4 11.9 34.3 67.2 — Other 369.5 151.0 148.6 28.4 41.5 $ 2,140.8 $ 372.6 $ 880.9 $ 202.0 $ 685.3 Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $56.8 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled. We recorded net restructuring costs of $110.7 million and $42.0 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of 42 January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $27.3 million during 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $71.9 million during 2020. We have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $890.0 million as of December 31, 2020 ($838.4 million for guarantees and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.9 million for 2020. Total capitalization as of December 31, 2020 was $3,577.4 million, comprised of $1,123.9 million in debt and $2,453.5 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 31% as of December 31, 2020 and 28% as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the “€500.0 million notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 million notes of €495.7 million were used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the €500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the ""€400.0 million notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million notes or the €400.0 million notes. Both the €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2020. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement On June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five-Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit, with an option to request an increase to the total availability by an additional $200 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. 43 Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.8 million annually. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. In the Credit Agreement, Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash in excess of $400 million. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. As defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of (0.12) to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 3.04 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2020. Other In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2020, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $340.3 million, of which $310.9 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $270.6 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2020. Our long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance. COVID-19 We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of December 31, 2020 and for the near future. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,567.1 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600 million of additional cash, which remains unused as of December 31, 2020, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300 million ($600 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $270.6 million was available to use as of December 31, 2020. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,094.5 million as of December 31, 2020 mature in 2022 and 2026, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 44 Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $34.1 million, $17.2 million and $13.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $22.0 million in 2021. The increase in 2020 pension expense is primarily due to the settlement of a U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2020. The calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact annual expense recorded related to the plans. In determining the estimated 2021 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 0.6% compared to 1.1% for 2020, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 1.5% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2021 estimated pension expense compared to 2.2% used for the calculation of the 2020 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would impact our 2021 consolidated pension expense by a decrease of $0.9 million and an increase of $3.3 million, respectively. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would correspondingly decrease or increase our 2021 consolidated pension expense by $1.7 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. The accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not exceed the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements. We provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and 45 experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. For the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included sustained operating losses resulting from the ongoing decline and increased uncertainty in the outlook of the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector in Germany, coupled with the significant implications of the COVID-19 crisis. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $66.8 million, which resulted in full impairment of the remaining goodwill in the Germany reporting unit. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value for our Germany reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test and our quarterly assessments in the intervening periods due to the factors discussed above. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2020 and determined that there was no impairment. The table below provides our reporting units’ estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 80% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2020. (in millions) France United States Right Management United Kingdom Canada Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 2,367.8 $ 1,194.0 $ 383.3 $ 360.9 $ 153.2 $ 84.5 Carrying values 1,320.7 758.2 117.9 321.5 84.9 81.8 The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20% in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units. The United Kingdom reporting unit had a fair value exceeding carrying value of approximately 12%. Key assumptions included in the United Kingdom (Northern Europe Segment) discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 were a discount rate of 11.5%, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 1.0%, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.1%. The Netherlands reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, approximating 3.3%. The Netherlands is part of the Northern Europe Segment. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 included a discount rate of 10.9%, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0%, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5%. Should the operations of the United Kingdom and Netherlands businesses incur further decreases in the operating results, including declines in profitability and cash flow due to continued deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including uncertainty of the financial impacts from COVID-19, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands or United Kingdom reporting units, which were $119.3 million and $100.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units fair values exceeded 20% or more of their respective carrying values, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations Market Risks We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Exchange Rates Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries and our Euro-denominated borrowings. For our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rates impact the United States dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in the subsidiaries and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries. Approximately 87% of our revenues and profits are generated outside of the United States, with 46% generated from our European operations with a Euro-functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, particularly the Euro, may have a significant impact on our reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates each month. Consequently, as the value of the United States dollar changes relative to the currencies of our major markets, our reported results vary. The United States dollar strengthened in the first half of 2020 and weakened in the second half of 2020 against many of the currencies of our major markets during 2020, whereas it generally strengthened in 2019. Revenues from services in constant currency were 0.2% lower and 4.2% higher than reported revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. A change in the strength of the United States dollar by an additional 10% would have impacted our revenues from services by approximately 8.7% from the amounts reported in both 2020 and 2019. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the United States dollar amount of our shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of our non-United States subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The United States dollar weakened relative to many foreign currencies as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, particularly in Euro- and GBP-functional currencies. Consequently, shareholders’ equity increased by $82.3 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2020. If the United States dollar had weakened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2020, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have increased by approximately $124.0 million from the amounts reported. As of December 31, 2019, the United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies compared to December 31, 2018. Consequently, shareholders’ equity decreased by $22.5 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2019. If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2019, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have decreased by approximately $186.2 million from the amounts reported. Although currency fluctuations impact our reported results and shareholders’ equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. We generally have few cross-border transfers of funds, except for transfers to the United States for payment of license fees and interest expense on intercompany loans, working capital loans made between the United States and our foreign subsidiaries, dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, and payments between certain countries and territories for services provided. To reduce the currency risk related to these transactions, we may borrow funds in the relevant foreign currency under our revolving credit agreement or we may enter into a forward contract to hedge the transfer. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding $1,094.5 million in principal amount of Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2020. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are 47 included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ equity decreased by $69.9 million, net of tax, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2020, due to the currency impact on these designated borrowings. The hypothetical impact of the stated change in rates on 2020 total other comprehensive income (loss) for the Euro Notes is as follows: 2020 (in millions) Market Sensitive Instrument 10% Depreciation in Exchange Rates 10% Appreciation in Exchange Rates Euro Notes: €500.0, 1.81% Notes due June 2026 $ 61.1 $ (61.1 ) €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 48.9 (48.9 ) Forward contracts: £0.6 to $0.8 $ (0.1 ) $ 0.1 €(130.3) to $(159.0) 16.0 (16.0 ) ¥182.4 to $1.8 (0.2 ) 0.2 Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, we had the following fixed- and variable-rate borrowings: (in millions) Amount Weighted- Average Interest Rate (1) Variable-rate borrowings $ 20.4 7.9 % Fixed-rate borrowings 1,103.5 1.9 % Total debt $ 1,123.9 (1) The rates are impacted by currency exchange rate movements. Impact of Economic Conditions One of the principal attractions of using workforce solutions and service providers is to maintain a flexible supply of labor to meet changing economic conditions. Therefore, the industry has been and remains sensitive to economic cycles. To help minimize the effects of these economic cycles, we offer clients a continuum of services to meet their needs throughout the business cycle. We believe that the breadth of our operations and the diversity of our service mix cushion us against the impact of an adverse economic cycle in any single country or industry. However, adverse economic conditions in any of our largest markets, or in several markets simultaneously, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 19, 2021 50 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of ManpowerGroup Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases, effective January 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the modified retrospective transition approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill - United Kingdom, United States, and Netherlands Reporting Units – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The annual impairment test of goodwill at a reporting unit level is performed annually during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its respective carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. 51 Given that forecasted revenues and operating unit profit margins for the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in demand and efficiency of operations, and considering the low excess fair value of these reporting units, auditing these estimates and assumptions including the selected discount rates involved especially subjective judgment. As a result, we identified the Company’s evaluation of goodwill impairment for the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States reporting units as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment and the increased extent of effort that was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s significant estimates and assumptions, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins, and the selection of discount rates for the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States reporting units included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill, including controls over the forecasts related to revenue and operating unit profit margin and selection of discount rates. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast revenue and operating unit margins by performing a retrospective comparison of prior forecasts to actual results. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and operating unit margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) forecasted information included in Company press releases, analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s fair value estimate by: o Developing an independent range of fair values based on market multiples of similar companies and comparing this to the company’s estimated fair values. o Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. o Developing a range of independent estimates of discount rates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 19, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005. 52 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS in millions, except per share data Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Revenues from services $ 18,001.0 $ 20,863.5 $ 21,991.2 Cost of services 15,176.3 17,488.4 18,412.2 Gross profit 2,824.7 3,375.1 3,579.0 Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 2,570.3 2,666.2 2,782.3 Goodwill impairment charges 66.8 64.0 — Selling and administrative expenses 2,637.1 2,730.2 2,782.3 Operating profit 187.6 644.9 796.7 Interest and other expenses (income), net 39.9 ( 40.6 ) 42.0 Earnings before income taxes 147.7 685.5 754.7 Provision for income taxes 123.9 219.8 198.0 Net earnings $ 23.8 $ 465.7 $ 556.7 Net earnings per share - basic $ 0.41 $ 7.78 $ 8.62 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 0.41 $ 7.72 $ 8.56 Weighted average shares - basic 58.0 59.9 64.6 Weighted average shares - diluted 58.3 60.3 65.1 The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in millions, except share and per share data (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations ManpowerGroup Inc. is a world leader in the innovative workforce solutions and services industry. Our global network of over 2,200 offices in 75 countries and territories allows us to meet the needs of our global, multinational and local clients across all major industry segments. Our largest operations, based on revenues, are located in France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. We specialize in permanent, temporary and contract recruitment and assessment; training and development; outsourcing; career management and workforce consulting services. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. Our business, operations and consolidated financial statements for 2020 were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. By the end of March, significant lockdown measures had been implemented in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. At the beginning of the third quarter, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis stabilized in many parts of the world, and economies slowly reopened. However, in late 2020, a number of countries started to see increased cases of COVID-19 that led to the implementation of new restrictions in an effort to mitigate the spread. Unlike the lockdowns and restrictions experienced earlier in the year, the same country-wide lockdowns did not occur, but more targeted and localized restrictions. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We are continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations will continue to be adversely affected. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include our operating results and the operating results of all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and the noncontrolling shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, or we have significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for equity investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our ownership share of earnings of these equity method investments, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments, as well as certain other relationships, are also evaluated for consolidation under the accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. These investments were $ 106.6 and $ 97.8 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 57 are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are $ 8.0 and $ 3.4 , respectively, of unremitted earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method. The remaining amounts as of December 31, 2020 relate to accounting for our remaining interest in ManpowerGroup Greater China under the equity method subsequent to deconsolidation (see Note 4 for further information). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As described further in Note 14, effective in the first quarter of 2020 our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. Revenues As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on revenue recognition using the modified retrospective approach applied to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption as there were no significant revenue recognition differences identified between the new and previous accounting guidance. We recognize revenues when control of the promised services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of any sales, value added, or other taxes collected from our clients. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service to the client, and it is the unit of account in the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in our contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. However, we have multiple performance obligations within our Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) contracts as discussed below. For performance obligations that we satisfy over time, revenues are recognized by consistently applying a method of measuring progress toward satisfaction of that performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time (e.g., hours, weeks, months) of service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of each performance obligation. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices included in the client contracts, using expected costs plus margin, or other observable prices. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Certain client contracts have variable consideration, including credits, sales allowances, rebates or other similar items that generally reduce the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration using whichever method, either the expected value method or most likely amount method, better predicts the amount of consideration to which we will become entitled based on the terms of the client contract and historical evidence. These amounts may be constrained and are only included in revenues to the extent we do not expect a significant reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our variable consideration amounts are not material, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates. Our client contracts generally include standard payment terms acceptable in each of the countries and territories in which we operate. The payment terms vary by the type and location of our clients and services offered. Client payments are typically due approximately 60 days after invoicing but may be a shorter or longer term depending on the contract. Our client contracts are generally short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. The timing between satisfaction of the performance obligation, invoicing and payment is not significant. For certain services and client types, we may require payment prior to delivery of services to the client, for which deferred revenue is recorded. In certain scenarios where a third-party vendor is involved in our revenue transactions with our clients, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent in the transaction. In situations where we act as principal in the transaction, we control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as gross revenues and cost of services. When we act as agent in the transaction, we do not control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as revenues on a net basis. 58 A majority of these agent transactions occur within our TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) programs where our performance obligation is to manage our client’s contingent workforce, and we earn a commission based on the amount of staffing services that are managed through the program. We are the agent in these transactions as we do not control the third-party providers' staffing services provided to the client through our MSP program prior to those services being transferred to the client. For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. As allowed under the new guidance, we do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to December 31, 2020 related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 34.9 at December 31, 2020 and $ 44.5 at December 31, 2019. We recognized the entire amount of the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019 as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to recognize the entire amount of deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020 as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration for historical write-off experience, the current aging of receivables, market conditions and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. Balance at Beginning of Year Provisions Charged to Earnings Write-Offs Translation Adjustments Reclassifications and Other Balance at End of Year 2020 $ 113.5 $ 20.3 $ ( 17.8 ) $ 8.1 $ 4.0 $ 128.1 2019 115.7 21.8 ( 19.1 ) ( 5.0 ) 0.1 113.5 2018 110.8 23.0 ( 12.0 ) ( 6.3 ) 0.2 115.7 Bad debt expense is recorded as selling and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and was $ 20.3 , $ 21.8 and $ 23.0 in 2020, 2019 and, 2018 respectively. Factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by our clients and other difficulties collecting amounts billed. On the other hand, an improved write-off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision. Write-offs were $ 17.8 , $ 19.1 and $ 12.0 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advertising Costs We expense production costs of advertising as they are incurred. Advertising expenses were $ 22.2 , $ 25.7 and $ 27.9 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 110.7 , $ 42.0 and $ 39.3 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of 59 January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $ 27.3 during 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $ 71.9 and $ 50.2 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 46.1 reserve will be paid by the end of 2021. As described further in Note 14, effective in the first quarter of 2020 our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 0.5 $ 1.9 $ 13.1 $ — $ — $ 15.5 Severance costs 3.8 5.2 17.6 3.5 2.3 32.4 Office closure costs 5.8 0.1 2.0 0.9 0.8 9.6 Costs paid or utilized ( 9.7 ) ( 6.5 ) ( 26.5 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 50.2 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 0.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ — $ — $ 7.3 Severance costs 5.5 16.2 49.8 2.5 0.2 74.2 Office closure costs 19.6 5.1 2.1 0.5 — 27.3 Other costs 4.4 3.2 0.5 1.1 — 9.2 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out ( 28.0 ) ( 21.7 ) ( 17.9 ) ( 4.1 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 71.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 1.9 $ 3.5 $ 40.7 $ — $ — $ 46.1 (1) Balance related to United States was $ 0.3 as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, United States incurred $ 1.3 for severance costs and $ 5.4 for office closure costs and paid/utilized $ 6.7 , leaving a $ 0.3 liability as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, United States incurred $ 3.8 for severance costs, $ 17.8 for office closure costs and $ 4.2 for other costs and paid/utilized $ 24.7 , leaving a $ 1.4 liability as of December 31, 2020. (2) Balance related to France was $ 1.1 as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, France paid/utilized $ 1.1 , leaving no liability as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, France incurred $ 2.6 for office closure costs and $ 1.2 for other costs and paid/utilized $ 3.2 , leaving a $ 0.6 liability as of December 31, 2020. Balance related to Italy was $ 0.5 as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, Italy incurred $ 2.3 for severance costs and paid/utilized $ 2.5 , leaving a $ 0.3 liability as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, Italy incurred $ 1.9 for severance costs, $ 0.5 for office closure costs and $ 1.0 for other costs and paid/utilized $ 2.3 , leaving a $ 1.4 liability as of December 31, 2020. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 60 Fair Value Measurements The assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Deferred compensation plan assets $ 119.4 $ 119.4 $ — $ — $ 107.3 $ 107.3 $ — $ — Cross-currency swaps 12.1 — 12.1 — 9.7 — 9.7 — Foreign currency forward contracts 1.0 — 1.0 — — — — — $ 132.5 $ 119.4 $ 13.1 $ — $ 117.0 $ 107.3 $ 9.7 $ — Liabilities Cross-currency swaps $ 30.5 $ — $ 30.5 $ — $ 6.0 $ — $ 6.0 $ — $ 30.5 $ — $ 30.5 $ — $ 6.0 $ — $ 6.0 $ — We determine the fair value of our deferred compensation plan assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are measured at the value based on a third party valuation model that performs a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and market observable inputs such as current and forward interest rates and current and forward foreign exchange rates The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,094.5 and $ 1,062.5 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,159.1 and $ 1,002.9 , respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We had goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,225.8 $ — $ 1,225.8 $ 1,260.1 $ — $ 1,260.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 473.0 $ 403.8 $ 69.2 $ 460.5 $ 375.7 $ 84.8 Other 21.9 21.6 0.3 20.9 13.7 7.2 494.9 425.4 69.5 481.4 389.4 92.0 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 127.1 — 127.1 124.6 — 124.6 179.1 — 179.1 176.6 — 176.6 Total intangible assets $ 674.0 $ 425.4 $ 248.6 $ 658.0 $ 389.4 $ 268.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 and $ 577.4 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. 61 The consolidated amortization expense related to intangibles was $ 27.2 , $ 29.8 and $ 35.1 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense expected in each of the next five years related to acquisitions completed as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: 2021 - $ 16.8 , 2022 - $ 13.4 , 2023 - $ 10.7 , 2024 - $ 8.4 and 2025 - $ 6.3 . The weighted-average useful lives of the customer relationships and other are approximately 12 and 3 years, respectively. The tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the tradenames, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Indefinite-lived reacquired franchise rights resulted from our franchise acquisitions in the United States, Switzerland and Canada. These rights entitled the franchisees with unilateral control to operate perpetually in particular territories, and have therefore been assigned an indefinite life. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland.) In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018, and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible as a result of our annual tests. The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units. The United Kingdom reporting unit had a fair value exceeding carrying value of approximately 12 %. Key assumptions included in the United Kingdom (Northern Europe Segment) discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 were a discount rate of 11.5 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 1.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.1 %. The Netherlands reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 %, approximating 3.3 %. The Netherlands is part of the Northern Europe Segment. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 included a discount rate of 10.9 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. Should the operations of the United Kingdom and Netherlands businesses incur further decreases in the operating results, including declines in profitability and cash flow due to continued deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including uncertainty of the financial impacts from COVID-19, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands or United Kingdom reporting units, which were $ 119.3 and $ 100.2 , respectively, as of December 31, 2020 could be subject to impairment. We determine the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing an income approach derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. The income approach is developed from management’s forecasted cash flow data. Significant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2020 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit (“OUP”) margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 9.1 % to 13.5 %, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and OUP margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and OUP margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We would record a goodwill impairment charge by the amount for which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. We are also required to test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. For the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included sustained operating losses resulted from the ongoing decline and increased uncertainty in the outlook of the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector in Germany, coupled with the significant implications of COVID-19. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. As a result of 62 our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 66.8 , which resulted in full impairment of the remaining goodwill in the Germany reporting unit. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value for our Germany reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test and our quarterly assessments in the intervening periods due to the factors discussed above. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote down the carrying value of the Germany reporting unit to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $ 60.2 during the second quarter of 2019. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to our New Zealand operations as a result of it not meeting profitability expectations. The New Zealand reporting unit is included in the APME segment. Marketable Securities Prior to April 2019, when we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise to obtain full ownership of the entity, we accounted for our 49 % interest in our Swiss franchise under the equity method of accounting. The Swiss franchise maintained an investment portfolio with a market value of $ 219.9 as of December 31, 2018. The portfolio was comprised of a wide variety of European and United States debt and equity securities and various professionally-managed funds, all of which were classified as available-for-sale, as well as cash and cash equivalents. Since January 1, 2018, upon adoption of the new accounting guidance on financial instruments, we recognized all the changes in fair value on the investment portfolio in the current period earnings. Our share of net unrealized gains and unrealized losses that were determined to be temporary related to these investments was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with the offsetting amount increasing or decreasing our investment in the franchise. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, realized gains totaled $ 0.0 , $ 0.3 and $ 12.7 , respectively, and realized losses totaled $ 0.0 , $ 0.2 and $ 2.1 , respectively. Other-than-temporary impairment amounts were insignificant for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Capitalized Software for Internal Use We capitalize purchased software as well as internally developed software. Internal software development costs are capitalized from the time when the internal-use software is considered probable of completion until the software is ready for use. Business analysis, system evaluation, selection and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software which ranges from 3 to 10 years . The net capitalized software balance of $ 19.2 and $ 7.5 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense related to the capitalized software costs was $ 1.8 , $ 2.0 and $ 1.5 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Property and Equipment A summary of property and equipment as of December 31 is as follows: 2020 2019 Land $ 0.5 $ 0.5 Buildings 7.1 10.2 Furniture, fixtures, and autos 167.1 164.8 Computer equipment 133.8 130.3 Leasehold improvements 306.2 299.7 Property and equipment $ 614.7 $ 605.5 Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using primarily the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings - up to 40 years; furniture, fixtures, autos and computer equipment - 2 to 63 15 years ; leasehold improvements - lesser of life of asset or expected lease term . Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized whereas expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to income as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the difference between the unamortized cost and the proceeds is recorded as either a gain or a loss and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Leases As of January 1, 2019, we adopted the new accounting guidance on leases, which requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depend on the classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with previous accounting guidance. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption. We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 11 years. Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. We elected the package of three practical expedients which lessened the transitional burden of implementing the new guidance. Accordingly, we did not reassess: 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; or 3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Lastly, we have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. That is, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. Derivative Financial Instruments We account for our derivative instruments in accordance with the accounting guidance on derivative instruments and hedging activities. Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. 64 Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of our non-United States subsidiaries have been translated in accordance with the accounting guidance on foreign currency translation. Under the accounting guidance, asset and liability accounts are translated at the current exchange rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rates each month. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in shareholders’ equity. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes is accounted for as a hedge of our net investment in our subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the amount of the related borrowings, net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ Equity The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2019, August 2018 and July 2016. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During 2020, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 264.7 . The repurchases in 2020 occurred within the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2020. In 2019, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $ 203.0 under the 2018 authorization. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $ 500.7 . As of December 31, 2020, there were 3.4 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under either the 2018 or 2016 authorization. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $ 2.26 , $ 2.18 and $ 2.02 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $ 129.1 , $ 129.3 and $ 127.3 , respectively. Noncontrolling interests, included in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded income of $ 4.7 and $ 4.9 for 2020 and 2018, respectively, and expense of $ 1.8 for 2019. The income recorded in 2020 was due to losses in a joint venture in Germany. The income recorded in 2018 was due to a revision in one of our joint venture agreements. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, term deposits with banks and short-term highly-liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value; and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Payroll Tax Credit In January 2013, the French government passed legislation, Credit d’Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi (“CICE”), that provided payroll tax credits based on a percentage of wages paid to employees receiving less than two-and-a-half times the French minimum wage. The payroll tax credit was equal to 4 % of eligible wages in 2013, 6 % of eligible wages in 2014 to 2016, 7 % of eligible wages in 2017, and 6 % of eligible wages in 2018. The CICE payroll tax credit was accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period earned. In January 2019, the French government replaced the CICE program with a new subsidy program. The payroll tax credit was creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years . Given the amount of our current income taxes payable, we would generally receive 65 the vast majority of these payroll tax credits after the three-year period. In April 2019 and April 2018, we entered into agreements to sell the credits earned in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ) and $ 234.5 (€ 190.9 ),respectively, which represented approximately half of the credits earned in 2018 and substantially all the credits earned in 2017. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement were such that the transaction qualified for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective year. Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2020 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable loss has been incurred. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. We are currently assessing the impact of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates. We do not expect a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 66 (2) Revenue Recognition Revenue Service Types The following is a description of our revenue service types, including Staffing and Interim, Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting, Permanent Recruitment and Other services. Staffing and Interim Staffing and Interim services include the augmentation of clients’ workforce with our contingent employees performing services under the client’s supervision, which provides our clients with a source of flexible labor. Staffing and Interim client contracts are generally short-term in nature, and we generally enter into contracts that include only a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each hour of Staffing and Interim service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting Our Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting services include utilizing consultants and contingent employees who are generally experts in a specific field advising the client to help find strategic solutions to specific matters or achieve a particular outcome. Our services may also include managing certain processes and functions within the client’s organization. We recognize revenues over time based on (i) our clients benefiting from our services as we are providing them, (ii) our clients controlling an asset as it is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance not creating an asset with an alternative use and having an enforceable right to payment for the services we have provided to date. We generally utilize an input measure of time for the service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of these performance obligations. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Permanent Recruitment Permanent Recruitment services include providing qualified candidates to our clients to hire on a permanent basis. We recognize revenues for our Permanent Recruitment services at a point in time when we place the qualified candidate, because we have determined that control of the performance obligation has transferred to the client (i.e., service performed) as we have the right to payment for our service and the client has accepted our service of providing a qualified candidate to fill a permanent position. Revenues recognized from our Permanent Recruitment services are based upon either a fixed fee per placement or as a percentage of the candidate’s salary. Our RPO services are also included in our Permanent Recruitment revenues. RPO services include the various activities of managing a client's permanent workforce, which can include candidate assessments, screening, conducting candidate interviews, providing sourcing technology, and providing our marketing and recruiting expertise. We perform these activities to fulfill the overall obligation to provide permanent workforce management services, so they are not individually distinct and, therefore, we account for them as a single performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time in months, but we do have a few contracts for which we use labor hours of management services provided as this more accurately depicts the progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of management services provided, as each month of management services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of management services as we provide them. For those contracts for which we use labor hours as the input measure, we recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each labor hour of management services provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. We consider the RPO management services and placement services to be distinct and, therefore, separate performance obligations within our RPO contracts as (i) our clients can benefit from each service on its own, and (ii) each service is separately identifiable within the client contract. The prices as specified in our contracts will generally be broken out between management fees and placement fees, which we consider the standalone selling price of each service as they are the observable inputs which depict the prices as if they were sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. The consideration from our client contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. 67 Other Services Other services include revenues from outplacement services, MSP services, training services and franchise fees. • Outplacement services include assisting our clients in managing their workforce transitions and their employees in managing career changes by developing additional skills and finding new employment. We recognize revenues over time as we provide the service (i.e., transfer control of the performance obligation) using the input measure of hours of service to measure progress toward completion of the performance obligation. • MSP services include overall program management of our clients’ contingent workforce and generally include various activities such as reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution, depending on each client contract. We provide these services to fulfill the overall obligation of contingent workforce management services so the individual activities are not distinct and therefore we account for them as a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of MSP services provided, as each month of MSP services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of MSP services as we provide them. • Training services include teaching skills that relate to specific competencies in order for our client’s workforce to acquire knowledge and develop skills proficiencies. We recognize revenues over time for each hour of training service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. • Our franchise fees include the performance obligation of providing the right to use our intellectual property in a specifically defined exclusive te rritory as defined in a franchise agreement. Our franchise agreements generally state that franchise fees are calculated based on a percentage of revenues earned by the franchise operations and are payable on a monthly basis. As such, we record franchise fee revenues monthly over time calculated based on the specific fee percentage and the monthly revenues of the franchise operations. Franchise fees were $ 14.1 , $ 18.4 and $ 24.1 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Disaggregation of Revenues In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types and timing of revenue recognition and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenues by reportable segment. As described further in Note 14, effective in the first quarter of 2020 our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. 68 Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 1,942.9 $ 125.3 $ 88.4 $ 170.6 $ 2,327.2 $ 2,186.8 $ 150.7 $ 98.0 $ 155.1 $ 2,590.6 Other Americas 1,393.0 41.8 17.8 12.6 1,465.2 1,596.6 53.0 25.4 13.0 1,688.0 3,335.9 167.1 106.2 183.2 3,792.4 3,783.4 203.7 123.4 168.1 4,278.6 Southern Europe: France 3,985.6 295.7 39.7 17.1 4,338.1 5,159.5 237.8 52.1 30.2 5,479.6 Italy 1,296.7 30.1 27.0 16.9 1,370.7 1,401.9 45.5 37.6 23.3 1,508.3 Other Southern Europe 1,752.0 341.5 39.9 13.0 2,146.4 1,800.7 333.8 58.9 13.1 2,206.5 7,034.3 667.3 106.6 47.0 7,855.2 8,362.1 617.1 148.6 66.6 9,194.4 Northern Europe 3,545.7 264.9 100.3 65.8 3,976.7 4,180.9 339.9 145.6 69.1 4,735.5 APME 1,876.3 340.7 121.6 38.1 2,376.7 2,159.7 301.7 159.9 33.7 2,655.0 Total $ 15,792.2 $ 1,440.0 $ 434.7 $ 334.1 $ 18,001.0 $ 18,486.1 $ 1,462.4 $ 577.5 $ 337.5 $ 20,863.5 Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 2,281.7 $ 45.5 $ 2,327.2 $ 2,536.7 $ 53.9 $ 2,590.6 Other Americas 1,453.6 11.6 1,465.2 1,670.6 17.4 1,688.0 3,735.3 57.1 3,792.4 4,207.3 71.3 4,278.6 Southern Europe: France 4,301.8 36.3 4,338.1 5,430.7 48.9 5,479.6 Italy 1,345.4 25.3 1,370.7 1,473.6 34.7 1,508.3 Other Southern Europe 2,113.0 33.4 2,146.4 2,157.7 48.8 2,206.5 7,760.2 95.0 7,855.2 9,062.0 132.4 9,194.4 Northern Europe 3,889.2 87.5 3,976.7 4,608.7 126.8 4,735.5 APME 2,310.0 66.7 2,376.7 2,554.1 100.9 2,655.0 Total $ 17,694.7 $ 306.3 $ 18,001.0 $ 20,432.1 $ 431.4 $ 20,863.5 69 (3) Share-Based Compensation Plans During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $ 24.2 , $ 26.3 and $ 27.8 , respectively, in share-based compensation expense related to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units, all of which is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Consideration received from share-based awards for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 7.4 , $ 7.0 and $ 5.2 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized related to share-based compensation during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 1.7 , $ 1.8 and $ 4.5 , respectively. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each award. Stock Options All share-based compensation is granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of ManpowerGroup Inc. (“2011 Plan”). Options and stock appreciation rights are granted at a price not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Generally, options are granted with a ratable vesting period of up to four years and expire ten years from date of grant. No stock appreciation rights had been granted or were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. A summary of stock option activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg.

The total fair value of options vested during the same periods was $ 2.3 , $ 2.3 and $ 3.1 , respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation cost was approximately $ 2.0 , net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Average risk-free interest rate 1.5 % 2.5 % 2.6 % Expected dividend yield 2.5 % 2.9 % 1.6 % Expected volatility 27.0 % 27.0 % 27.0 % Expected term (years) 6.0 6.0 6.0 The average risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (weighted 75 %) of our stock price over the past five years and implied volatility (weighted 25 %) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We believe that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than considering purely historical volatility. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option granted during the year was $ 18.95 , $ 17.78 and $ 31.46 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Deferred Stock Our non-employee directors may elect to receive deferred stock in lieu of part or all of their annual cash retainer otherwise payable to them. The number of shares of deferred stock is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the terms and conditions adopted under the 2011 Plan; the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock according to these terms and conditions. During December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were 1,432 , 1,275 and 5,551 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. Non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of deferred stock (or restricted stock, if they so elect) as additional compensation for board service. The award vests in equal quarterly installments over one year and the vested portion of the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock either upon a director’s termination of service or three years after the date of grant (which may in most cases be extended at the directors’ election) in accordance with the terms and conditions under the 2011 Plan. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were 11,004 , 18,172 and 10,152 , respectively, shares of deferred stock and 7,208 , 7,407 and 6,345 , respectively, shares of restricted stock granted under this arrangement, all of which are vested except for 1,666 shares of restricted stock granted in 2018 that were cancelled. We recognized expense of $ 1.3 , $ 1.4 and $ 1.9 related to deferred stock in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 71 Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and to non-employee directors who may elect to receive restricted stock rather than deferred stock as described above. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging up to six years , and in some cases upon retirement. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Unvested, January 1, 2018 448 $ 77 1.2 Granted 145 119 Vested ( 174 ) 77 Forfeited ( 23 ) 89 Unvested, December 31, 2018 396 $ 92 1.3 Granted 236 $ 84 Vested ( 150 ) 76 Forfeited ( 36 ) 93 Unvested, December 31, 2019 446 $ 97 1.5 Granted 200 $ 92 Vested ( 145 ) 95 Forfeited ( 17 ) 93 Unvested, December 31, 2020 484 $ 94 1.4 $ 44 During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $ 15.7 , $ 15.5 and $ 13.3 , respectively, of expense related to restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $ 17.2 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. Performance Share Units Our 2011 Plan allows us to grant performance share units. Historically, our performance shares have been granted with a typical performance period of three years . Vesting of units occurs at the end of the performance period or after a subsequent holding period, except in the case of termination of employment where the units are forfeited immediately. Upon retirement, a prorated number of units vest depending on the period worked from the grant date to retirement date or in certain cases all of the units vest. In the case of death or disability, the units immediately vest at the Target Award level if the death or disability date is during the performance period, or at the level determined by the performance criteria met during the performance period if the death or disability occurs during the subsequent holding period. The units are settled in shares of our common stock. A payout multiple is applied to the units awarded based on the performance criteria determined by the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. In the event the performance criteria exceeds the Target Award level, an additional number of shares, up to the Outstanding Award level, may be granted. In the event the performance criteria falls below the Target Award level, a reduced number of shares, as low as the Threshold Award level, may be granted. If the performance criteria falls below the Threshold Award level, no shares will be granted. 72 A summary of the performance share units detail by grant year is as follows: 2017 2018 2019 2020 Grant Date(s) February 9, 2017 February 15, 2018 February 15, 2019 February 14, 2020 Performance Period (years) 2017-2019 2018-2020 2019-2021 2020-2022 Vesting Date February 2020(a) February 2021(a) February 2022(a) February 2023(a) Payout Levels (in units): Threshold Award 57,563 42,361 61,381 59,698 Target Award 115,125 84,726 122,761 119,395 Outstanding Award 230,250 169,452 245,522 238,790 Shares Issued in 2020 88,807 — — — Payout Achieved Over Performance Period — 42,361 — — (a) 2018, 2019 and 2020 awards are scheduled to vest in February 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, when the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the achievement of the performance criteria. We recognize and adjust compensation expense based on the likelihood of the performance criteria specified in the award being achieved. The compensation expense is recognized over the performance and holding periods and is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. We have recognized total compensation expense of $ 3.7 , $ 5.2 and $ 8.4 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the performance share units. (4) Acquisitions and Dispositions Switzerland Acquisitions On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 219.5 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 161.2 was for cash and cash equivalents. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The total cash impact of the acquisition was an inflow of $ 98.0 , net of cash acquired of $ 317.5 In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 80.4 , $ 32.5 represented foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest from accumulated other comprehensive loss. 73 The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of April 3, 2019: Cash and cash equivalents $ 317.5 Accounts receivable 60.4 Prepaid expenses and other assets 31.4 Goodwill 33.8 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 19.6 Intangible assets not subject to amortization, reacquired franchise rights 25.5 Property and equipment 0.4 Accounts payable ( 21.6 ) Employee compensation payable ( 2.5 ) Accrued liabilities ( 9.9 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 7.5 ) Value added taxes payable ( 7.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 24.6 ) Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 415.1 Other Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 2.6 , $ 47.7 and $ 51.8 , respectively. The 2020 and 2019 balances include consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 1.9 and $ 13.0 , respectively, had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $ 9.1 and contingent consideration payments of $ 42.7 , of which $ 18.6 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. No goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in 2020. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2019 acquisitions, excluding Manpower Switzerland, were $ 14.2 and $ 9.0 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $ 6.1 and $ 0.7 , respectively. ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited Disposition On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51 % controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25 % of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25 %, and then further diluted to 36.87 % as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $ 30.4 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the $30.4 was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $ 6.2 related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive loss. Other Dispositions Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations in order to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. On September 30, 2020 we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for $ 5.8 subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into 74 franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $ 5.8 , which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for an after tax net gain of $ 3.8 and divested a majority interest in a fully consolidated entity in China for an immaterial gain. (5) Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Current United States Federal $ 5.2 $ 16.7 $ 17.2 State 4.5 2.5 10.8 Non-United States 124.6 243.6 181.9 Total current 134.3 262.8 209.9 Deferred United States Federal ( 11.0 ) ( 22.1 ) ( 7.5 ) State ( 4.9 ) 1.1 1.0 Non-United States 5.5 ( 22.0 ) ( 5.4 ) Total deferred ( 10.4 ) ( 43.0 ) ( 11.9 ) Total provision $ 123.9 $ 219.8 $ 198.0 75 A tax reconciliation between taxes computed at the United States federal statutory rate of 21 % and the consolidated effective tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Income tax based on statutory rate $ 31.0 $ 143.9 $ 158.5 Increase (decrease) resulting from: Non-United States tax rate difference: French business tax (1) 43.7 54.9 59.1 French CICE (2) — — ( 39.9 ) Other (1)(2) 9.7 37.3 20.0 Repatriation of non-United States earnings ( 2.0 ) ( 17.8 ) 2.5 State income taxes, net of federal benefit ( 1.3 ) 3.1 8.2 Change in valuation allowance (3) 48.5 20.0 0.7 Work Opportunity Tax Credit (4) ( 4.9 ) ( 10.4 ) ( 8.8 ) Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction ( 8.8 ) ( 11.9 ) ( 12.5 ) United States Tax Act and French tax reform — — 3.2 Goodwill impairment (5) 13.4 11.9 — Gain related to Manpower Switzerland and Greater China transactions (6) — ( 22.8 ) — Other, net ( 5.4 ) 11.6 7.0 Tax provision $ 123.9 $ 219.8 $ 198.0 (1) The French business tax is allowed as a deduction for French income tax purposes. The gross amount of the French business tax was $ 55.3 , $ 69.5 and $ 74.8 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts in the table above of $ 43.7 , $ 54.9 and $ 59.1 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represent the French business tax expense net of the French tax benefit using the United States federal rate of 21 %. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences are benefits of $ 6.1 , $ 9.3 and $ 10.1 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the difference between the United States federal rate and the French tax rate applied to the respective gross amounts of the French business tax. In December 2020, the French Parliament approved the Finance Bill for 2021 which lowered the business tax rate from 1.5 % to 0.75 %. The benefit of this tax rate reduction will be reflected in our 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) The French CICE was a payroll tax credit that was tax-free for French tax purposes and increased French earnings. The amount in the table above of $ 39.9 for 2018 represents the French tax benefit using the United States federal rate of 21 %. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences is a benefit of $ 25.5 for 2018 related to the difference between the United States federal rate and French tax rate applied to the respective gross French CICE amount. In January 2019, the French government replaced the CICE subsidy with new subsidies that are taxable. (3) In 2020, we determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Germany and the Netherlands would not be realized and recorded income tax expense of $ 36.9 and $ 8.1 , respectively, to establish valuation allowances. (4) In December 2020, the Consolidation Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law, which includes a five-year extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit through December 31, 2025. (5) Non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charges recorded in Germany in June 2020 and 2019. (6) Non-taxable gains on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland in April 2019 and the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019. 76 Deferred income taxes are recorded based on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Temporary differences, which give rise to the deferred taxes, are as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Future Income Tax Benefits (Expense) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance $ 32.2 $ 12.8 Employee compensation payable 26.2 27.2 Pension and postretirement benefits 79.1 62.3 Intangible assets ( 113.6 ) ( 108.7 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings ( 10.0 ) ( 8.8 ) Loans denominated in foreign currencies 13.5 ( 16.4 ) Operating lease ROU assets ( 106.2 ) ( 115.8 ) Operating lease liabilities 112.0 118.1 Net operating losses 136.2 89.5 Other 127.9 135.0 Valuation allowance ( 149.4 ) ( 87.8 ) Total future tax benefits $ 147.9 $ 107.4 Deferred tax asset $ 165.7 $ 126.2 Deferred tax liability ( 17.8 ) ( 18.8 ) Total future tax benefits $ 147.9 $ 107.4 Pre-tax earnings of non-United States operations were $ 86.3 , $ 416.6 and $ 551.0 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on $ 439.0 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested. We have not estimated the deferred tax liability on these earnings as such estimation is not practicable to determine. As of December 31, 2020, deferred taxes for non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $ 2,077.6 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 10.0 and $ 8.8 , respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We had United States federal and non-United States net operating loss carryforwards and United States state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 658.6 and $ 167.2 , respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: United States Federal and Non-United States United States State 2021 $ 5.2 $ 4.6 2022 6.7 5.0 2023 3.9 9.8 2024 7.2 55.9 2025 20.7 5.6 Thereafter 49.6 85.5 No expirations 565.3 0.8 Total net operating loss carryforwards $ 658.6 $ 167.2 We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $ 136.2 as of December 31, 2020, for the benefit of these net operating losses. Realization of this asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards. A related valuation allowance of $ 115.2 was recorded as of December 31, 2020, as management believes that realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is unlikely. 77 We had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 64.5 , $ 69.5 and $ 34.2 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate if recognized. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next year. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We accrued net interest and penalties of $ 0.0 and $ 1.6 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2018, we recognized a reduction of interest and penalties of $ 18.4 due to the settlement of tax litigation. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2020, 2019 and 2018: 2020 2019 2018 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 65.9 $ 32.2 $ 46.1 Increases in prior year tax positions 1.4 35.7 11.4 Decreases in prior year tax positions ( 4.1 ) ( 2.6 ) ( 1.8 ) Increases for current year tax positions 3.2 4.7 5.9 Expiration of statute of limitations and audit settlements ( 5.5 ) ( 4.1 ) ( 29.4 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 60.9 $ 65.9 $ 32.2 Potential interest and penalties 3.6 3.6 2.0 Balance, end of year $ 64.5 $ 69.5 $ 34.2 We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2013 through 2020 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (6) Net Earnings Per Share The calculation of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Net earnings available to common shareholders: $ 23.8 $ 465.7 $ 556.7 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions): Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 58.0 59.9 64.6 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — — 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.3 0.4 0.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 58.3 60.3 65.1 Net earnings per share - basic $ 0.41 $ 7.78 $ 8.62 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 0.41 $ 7.72 $ 8.56 There were 0.6 million, 0.4 million, and 0.3 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (7) Goodwill As described further in Note 14, effective in the first quarter of 2020 our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. 78 Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total (4) Balance, January 1, 2019 $ 519.9 $ 112.2 $ 435.4 $ 102.0 $ 127.6 $ 1,297.1 Goodwill acquired 14.2 33.8 — — — 48.0 Goodwill allocated to business units deconsolidated (5) — — — ( 18.5 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 20.1 ) Impairment charge (6) — — ( 60.2 ) ( 3.8 ) — ( 64.0 ) Currency impact and other 1.5 ( 1.2 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 0.6 ) — ( 0.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 535.6 144.8 374.6 79.1 126.0 1,260.1 Impairment charge (7) — — ( 66.8 ) — — ( 66.8 ) Currency impact and other 1.0 10.1 18.8 2.6 — 32.5 Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 536.6 $ 154.9 $ 326.6 $ 81.7 $ 126.0 $ 1,225.8 (1) Balances related to United States were $ 490.3 as of January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 and $ 490.2 as of December 31, 2020. (2) Balances related to France were $ 68.9 , $ 67.3 and $ 73.3 as of January 1, 2019, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.8 , $ 4.6 and $ 4.2 as of January 1, 2019, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. (4) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 513.4 ($ 235.2 related to Right Management and $ 278.2 related to Corporate) as of January 1, 2019, $ 577.4 ($ 60.2 related to Northern Europe, $ 3.8 related to APME, $ 235.2 related to Right Management and $ 278.2 related to Corporate) as of December 31, 2019, and $ 644.2 ($ 127.0 related to Northern Europe, $ 3.8 related to APME, $ 235.2 related to Right Management and $ 278.2 related to Corporate) as of December 31, 2020. (5) Reductions relate to our China and Hong Kong reporting units, which were deconsolidated as of July 10, 2019. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (6) The 2019 impairment charges of $ 60.2 and $ 3.8 relate to our Germany and New Zealand reporting units, respectively, which were recorded during the second quarter of 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (7) The 2020 impairment charge of $ 66.8 relates to our Germany reporting unit, which was recorded during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: December 31 2020 2019 United States $ 545.7 $ 545.8 Netherlands 119.3 109.5 United Kingdom 100.2 97.3 France 73.3 67.3 Germany — 67.2 Other reporting units 387.3 373.0 Total goodwill $ 1,225.8 $ 1,260.1 79 (8) Debt Information concerning short-term borrowings is as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Short-term borrowings $ 20.4 $ 61.0 Weighted-average interest rates 7.9 % 7.7 % We maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2020, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $ 340.3 , of which $ 310.9 was unused. Under our revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $ 300.0 in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $ 600.0 in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $ 270.6 could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2020. A summary of long-term debt is as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Euro-denominated notes: € 500.0 due June 2026 $ 606.7 $ 555.8 € 400.0 due September 2022 487.8 447.1 Other 9.0 9.5 1,103.5 1,012.4 Less current maturities — — Long-term debt $ 1,103.5 $ 1,012.4 Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold € 500.0 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750 % notes due June 2026 (the “€ 500.0 notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 notes of € 495.7 were used to repay our € 350.0 notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 notes were issued at a price of 99.564 % to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809 %. Interest on the €500.0 notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our € 400.0 aggregate principal amount 1.875 % notes (the ""€400.0 notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $ 600.0 revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 notes or the €400.0 notes. Both the € 500.0 notes and € 400.0 notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2020. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement We have a Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of June 18, 2023 . The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $ 600.0 in various currencies, and up to $ 150.0 may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 0.5 as of both 80 December 31, 2020 and 2019. Additional borrowings of $ 599.5 were available to us under the facility as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. Debt Maturities The maturities of long-term debt payable within each of the four years subsequent to December 31, 2021 are as follows: 2022 - $ 494.0 , 2023 - $ 0.0 , 2024 - $ 0.0 , 2025 - $ 0.0 . (9) Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans For all of our United States defined benefit and retiree health care plans, we adopted the Society of Actuaries’ Pri-2012 Mortality Table with MP-2020 Mortality Improvement Scale in determining the plans’ benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. In 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (“PBGC”) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 , which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement, will be utilized to fund future qualified 401(k) plan contributions following the conclusion of the standard PBGC audit. In 2020 we recognized a partial settlement in our Switzerland pension plan as a result of local regulations and turnover common to our industry. As a result of the partial settlement we reclassified pension losses of $ 2.7 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). In 2019, a new pension plan was added as a result of our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) 81 The reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans are as follows. The actuarial (gain) loss related to the Non-United States plans benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 was primarily related to changes in discount rates. United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 52.8 $ 48.9 $ 794.8 $ 450.0 Service cost — — 21.0 15.1 Interest cost 0.8 1.8 8.6 10.9 Acquisitions — — — 201.2 Settlements ( 22.3 ) — ( 42.2 ) ( 40.9 ) Transfers — — 27.0 52.7 Actuarial (gain) loss ( 0.4 ) 6.3 90.9 100.1 Plan participant contributions — — 11.6 9.0 Benefits paid ( 2.4 ) ( 4.2 ) ( 13.2 ) ( 11.3 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — 67.1 8.0 Benefit obligation, end of year $ 28.5 $ 52.8 $ 965.6 $ 794.8 United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 38.8 $ 36.1 $ 655.4 $ 354.1 Actual return on plan assets 0.1 4.4 49.7 69.5 Acquisitions — — — 196.8 Settlements ( 22.3 ) — ( 42.2 ) ( 40.9 ) Transfers — — 26.2 51.6 Plan participant contributions — — 11.6 9.0 Company contributions ( 14.2 ) 2.5 16.1 15.4 Benefits paid ( 2.4 ) ( 4.2 ) ( 13.2 ) ( 11.3 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — 50.0 11.2 Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ — $ 38.8 $ 753.6 $ 655.4 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 28.5 ) $ ( 14.0 ) $ ( 211.9 ) $ ( 139.4 ) Amounts Recognized Noncurrent assets $ — $ 15.0 $ 32.1 $ 41.4 Current liabilities ( 2.4 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 0.7 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 26.1 ) ( 26.5 ) ( 242.8 ) ( 180.1 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 28.5 ) $ ( 14.0 ) $ ( 211.9 ) $ ( 139.4 ) 82 Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consisted of: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net loss $ 8.6 $ 15.8 $ 95.2 $ 50.5 Prior service cost — — 7.6 7.8 Total $ 8.6 $ 15.8 $ 102.8 $ 58.3 The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $ 957.0 and $ 817.6 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The ABO for plans that have plan assets was $ 841.6 and $ 717.2 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 491.5 $ 163.8 Plan assets 368.8 80.4 In 2020, one of our larger plans became further underfunded and its accumulated benefit obligation exceeded its plan assets as of December 31, 2020. As a result, this plan was included in the amounts disclosed above for 2020 but not for 2019. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $ 994.1 and $ 847.6 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The PBO for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Projected benefit obligation $ 503.2 $ 414.6 Plan assets 368.8 324.3 By their nature, certain of our plans do not have plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for these plans was $ 115.4 and $ 100.4 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The components of the net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for all plans were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost $ 21.0 $ 15.1 $ 10.9 Interest cost 9.4 12.7 11.6 Expected return on assets ( 13.5 ) ( 12.9 ) ( 10.6 ) Settlements 13.8 0.4 — Net loss 2.7 1.2 1.4 Prior service cost 0.7 0.7 0.6 Net periodic benefit cost 34.1 17.2 13.9 Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligation Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net loss (gain) 44.1 45.5 ( 16.6 ) Prior service cost 0.4 1.0 1.4 Amortization of net loss ( 6.3 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 1.4 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 0.6 ) Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss 37.5 44.2 ( 17.2 ) Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ 71.6 $ 61.4 $ ( 3.3 ) 83 The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the benefit obligation were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Discount rate 2.1 % 2.5 % 0.6 % 1.1 % Rate of compensation increase — 3.0 % 1.7 % 1.7 % The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Discount rate - service cost 2.5 % 4.2 % 3.6 % 1.1 % 1.8 % 2.1 % Discount rate - interest cost 2.5 % 4.2 % 3.2 % 1.1 % 1.8 % 2.1 % Expected long-term return on plan assets — 4.3 % 4.5 % 2.2 % 2.7 % 2.7 % Rate of compensation increase — 3.0 % 3.0 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans — — — 2.0 % 2.0 % — We determine our assumption for the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. Our overall expected long-term rate of return used in the measurement of the 2020 net periodic benefit cost on non-United States plans varied by country and ranged from 0.6 % to 3.0 %. None of our United States plans had plan assets as of December 31, 2020 due to the settlement of the Qualified Retirement Plan liability during the first quarter of 2020. For a majority of our plans, a building block approach has been employed to establish this return. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income instruments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. We also use guaranteed insurance contracts for four of our foreign plans. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected rate of return. Projected salary levels utilized in the determination of the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans are based upon historical experience and the future expectations for each respective country. Our plans’ investment policies are to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Our long-term objective is to minimize plan expenses and contributions by outperforming plan liabilities. We have historically used a balanced portfolio strategy based primarily on a target allocation of equity securities and fixed-income instruments, which vary by location. These target allocations, which are similar to the 2020 allocations, are determined based on the favorable risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted within a specified range to advance our overall objective. The fair values of our Level 1 and Level 2 pension plan assets are primarily determined by using market quotes and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Insurance contracts and annuity contracts are measured at the present value of expected future benefit payments primarily using associated interest curves. Hedge funds consist of a number of diversified funds including those investing in international securities, equity and private partnership interests valued using market available data and various models and assumptions. 84 The fair value of our pension plan assets by asset category was as follows. As of December 31, 2020, all of our plan assets were associated with non-United States plans.

The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the pension assets that are measured using Level 3 inputs. We determined that transfers between fair-value-measurement levels occurred on the date of the event that caused the transfer.

Due to the nature of the plan, there are no plan assets. The reconciliation of the changes in the plan’s benefit obligation and the statement of the funded status of the plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 14.1 $ 13.7 Interest cost 0.4 0.5 Actuarial loss 1.0 0.8 Benefits paid ( 0.9 ) ( 0.9 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 14.6 $ 14.1 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 14.6 ) $ ( 14.1 ) Amounts Recognized Current liabilities $ ( 1.1 ) $ ( 1.1 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 13.5 ) ( 13.0 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 14.6 ) $ ( 14.1 ) The amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consists of a net loss of $ 2.3 and $ 1.5 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a prior service credit of $ 2.9 and $ 3.5 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of the benefit obligation was 2.2 % and 3.0 % in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of net periodic benefit cost was 3.0 %, 4.2 % and 3.2 % in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for this plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Net Periodic Benefit Credit Interest cost $ 0.4 $ 0.5 $ 0.5 Net loss 0.1 — 0.1 Prior service credit ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) Net periodic benefit credit $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.2 ) Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net loss (gain) $ 1.1 $ 0.8 $ ( 0.5 ) Amortization of net loss ( 0.1 ) — ( 0.1 ) Amortization of prior service credit 0.8 0.8 0.8 Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss 1.8 1.6 0.2 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ 1.5 $ 1.3 $ — The health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 6.5 % for 2021, decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 % in 2027. Assumed health care cost trend rates are not expected to have a material effect on the amounts reported. 87 Future Contributions and Payments During 2021, we plan to contribute approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Projected benefit payments from the plans as of December 31, 2020 were estimated as follows: Year Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2021 $ 65.8 $ 1.1 2022 35.6 1.1 2023 27.1 1.1 2024 25.7 1.0 2025 25.0 1.0 2026–2029 150.0 4.6 Total projected benefit payments $ 329.2 $ 9.9 Defined Contribution Plans and Deferred Compensation Plans We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all permanent United States employees and various other employees throughout the world. With our company-sponsored plans, employees may elect to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans and we match a portion of their contributions up to a maximum percentage of the employee’s salary. In addition, profit sharing contributions are made if a targeted earnings level is reached at management’s discretion. The total expense for our match and any profit sharing contributions was $ 16.6 , $ 16.9 and $ 17.7 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In certain countries with statutory defined contribution plans, we pay a percentage of the employees' salary in pension premiums. The total expense for the statutory defined contribution plans was $ 27.5 , $ 32.1 and $ 37.4 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We also have deferred compensation plans in the United States. One of the plans had an asset and liability of $ 118.4 and $ 106.2 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the remaining plans holding immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities. (10) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Foreign currency translation $ ( 72.1 ) $ ( 260.5 ) Translation (loss) gain on derivative instruments, net of income taxes of $( 34.9 ) and $( 9.1 ), respectively ( 81.2 ) 13.1 Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 133.3 ) ( 121.5 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $( 38.2 ) and $( 30.9 ), respectively ( 111.4 ) ( 74.1 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.8 and $ 1.6 , respectively 0.7 2.0 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 397.3 ) $ ( 441.0 ) 88 (11) Interest and Other Expenses (Income), Net Interest and other expenses (income), net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 43.3 $ 44.4 $ 47.0 Interest income ( 13.1 ) ( 6.0 ) ( 6.0 ) Foreign exchange loss 4.9 6.7 1.4 Miscellaneous expenses (income), net (1) 4.8 ( 85.7 ) ( 0.4 ) Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 39.9 $ ( 40.6 ) $ 42.0 (1) Included in 2019 is an $ 80.4 gain related to our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (12) Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 487.8 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 606.7 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2020. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on OCI for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 was as follows: (Loss) Gain Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2020 2019 Euro Notes $ ( 90.3 ) $ 22.9 Cross-currency swaps ( 23.0 ) ( 9.0 ) Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each 89 period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019, we entered into to a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We apply the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on OCI, AOCL and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 2019: Gain Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCL into Income Year Ended December 31, Location of Gain Reclassified Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2020 2019 from AOCL into Income 2020 2019 Cross-currency swaps $ 1.4 $ 7.3 Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 1.1 $ 8.3 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains and losses included in AOCL at December 31, 2020 to be reclassified into earnings to approximate $ 1.0 over the next twelve months. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-Designated Instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 1.1 $ 11.9 90 Derivative and Non-Derivative Assets and Liabilities The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, and 2019: Assets December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 12.1 $ 9.7 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net 1.0 — Total instruments $ 13.1 $ 9.7 Liabilities December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,094.5 $ 1,002.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 30.5 6.0 Total instruments $ 1,125.0 $ 1,008.9 The fair value measurements of these items recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, outplacement services, talent management services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 92 Total assets for the segments are reported after the elimination of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany accounts.

We record accruals for loss contingencies based on the circumstances of each claim, when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition. 96 Guarantees We have entered into certain guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $ 890.0 as of December 31, 2020 ($ 838.4 for guarantees and $ 51.6 for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. 97 (16) Quarterly Data (Unaudited) First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total Year Ended December 31, 2020 Revenues from services $ 4,619.1 $ 3,742.2 $ 4,584.8 $ 5,054.9 $ 18,001.0 Gross profit 724.0 576.7 725.1 798.9 2,824.7 Operating profit (loss) (a)( c )(d) (e) 37.7 ( 50.0 ) 61.6 138.3 187.6 Net earnings (loss) (a)(b)(c)(d) (e)(f) 1.7 ( 64.4 ) 10.3 76.2 23.8 Net earnings (loss) per share - basic $ 0.03 $ ( 1.11 ) $ 0.18 $ 1.34 $ 0.41 Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted ( g ) 0.03 ( 1.11 ) 0.18 1.33 0.41 Dividends per share — 1.09 — 1.17 2.26 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Revenues from services $ 5,044.9 $ 5,373.1 $ 5,248.9 $ 5,196.6 $ 20,863.5 Gross profit 804.8 870.4 840.3 859.6 3,375.1 Operating profit ( h ) (i)(k) 105.5 130.8 217.0 191.6 644.9 Net earnings ( h ) (i)(j)(k) 53.5 127.3 146.1 138.8 465.7 Net earnings per share - basic $ 0.88 $ 2.12 $ 2.44 $ 2.35 $ 7.78 Net earnings per share - diluted ( l ) 0.88 2.11 2.42 2.33 7.72 Dividends per share — 1.09 — 1.09 2.18 (a) Included restructuring costs of $ 48.2 , $ 40.2 net of tax, $ 49.9 , $ 42.1 net of tax, and $ 12.6 , $ 8.7 net of tax, recorded in the first, third and fourth quarter, respectively.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 99 Item 9B.

Our Operations Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. 4 Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. When demand drops, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline at the same pace as revenues. In periods of economic contraction, we may have more significant expense deleveraging, as we believe it is prudent not to reduce selling and administrative expenses to levels that could negatively impact the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with an average days sales outstanding of between 55 and 60 days based on the markets where we do business. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Due to our industry’s sensitivity to economic factors, the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short-term nature of staffing assignments, it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with certainty. As a result, we monitor a number of economic indicators, as well as recent business trends, to predict future revenue trends for each of the countries and territories where we operate. Based upon these anticipated trends, we determine what level of personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities. During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have helped drive demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the global economy continues to grow and adapt with new technology, we are helping clients manage their workforce transformation and ensure they have the right skills now and in the future. Whether it is through workforce assessments, targeted training or by creating longer-term development paths, we help organizations and candidates adapt their skills to changing workforce needs. Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and industrial positions. These services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for over 70 years with a primary focus on the areas of office and industrial services and solutions. We provide services under our Experis brand, particularly in the areas of IT, Engineering, and Finance, that include high-impact solutions, and help accelerate organizations’ growth by attracting, assessing and placing specialized expertise to deliver in-demand talent for important positions. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates’ workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise or continue. ManpowerGroup Solutions specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and outcome-based solutions. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through exclusive outsourcing contracts. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative functions. TBO and Proservia services also include management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities. Our career management services have historically been counter-cyclical to our staffing services, which helps to offset the impact of an economic downturn on our overall financial results. 5 Americas We provide services as Manpower, Experis and ManpowerGroup Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The Americas segment had 562 branch and 172 franchise offices. In the United States, where we realized 60% of the Americas’ revenue, we had 376 branch and 164 franchise offices as of December 31, 2019, as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico and Argentina, we had 186 branch offices and 8 franchise offices. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise. Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower® service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchisee sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise with appropriate prices and terms.

It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the increasing demand for skilled people, employers’ desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including one of the employment services industry’s most recognized and respected brands; geographic 7 diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and high-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, and large national and multinational client relationships, which comprised approximately 60% of our revenues in 2019. Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses are based on a local or regional relationship, and tend to rely less on longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. The large national and multinational clients, on the other hand, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to local managers. As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed. Legal Regulations The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: • regulation of the employer/employee relationship between the firm and its temporary and contract employees; • registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements; • substantive limitations on the operations or the use of temporary and contract employees by clients; and • regulation that requires new or additional benefits and pay parity for our associates. In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us. In most countries, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, health and other benefits, anti-discrimination and workers’ compensation, govern the firm. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement. In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination. Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subject to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission’s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises. 8 Changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which workforce solutions and services firms may operate. These changes could impose additional costs, taxes, record keeping or reporting requirements; restrict the tasks to which contingent workers may be assigned; limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the relationship (with us or the client); or otherwise adversely affect the industry. In December 2018, the French government published their final budget for 2019, which replaced the CICE program with new subsidies in January 2019. This transition led to a profit-sharing cost that reduced the gross profit margin benefit of the subsidies. These subsidies are subject to income tax. In October 2019, incremental subsidies were implemented as expected. We offset the net negative impact in 2019 with ongoing initiatives. In Germany, the Confederation of German Trade Unions (representing eight German trade unions and over six million people) and the Employer’s Association of the Temporary Staffing Industry (representing two major temporary worker employers’ associations) entered into a Collective Labor Agreement (“CLA”), which was implemented in multiple phases between 2014 and 2017. The first phases of the CLA required higher wages to temporary employees and higher cost for vacation, sick pay, and temporary staff time accounts. The following phase went into effect in June 2016 with a 2.3% to 3.6% wage increase. A new CLA in 2017 required three additional wage increases through 2019, with wage increases of 2.5% to 4.8% in 2017, 2018, 2019. Proposed wage increases for 2020 range from 1.9% to 2.3% for both the east and west, with a second increase in the east of 2.2%. In 2021, the wage increases are between 3.0% and 7.1%, when the wage differences between the east and west will be eliminated. The proposed wage increase in 2022 is 4.1%. There is also a mandate that was effective in January 2018 of equal pay for our associates after nine months on assignment. This new regulation generally had an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in Germany, as we often cannot pass on the additional costs to the client or, if so, without a mark-up. In October 2018, the 18-month rule took effect, which limited the maximum period of associate assignments to 18 months, after which such associates will be classified as employees for their assignment and allowed clients to in-source our staff. There are initiatives in place to manage any potential impact. Trademarks We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries and territories. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup ® , ManpowerGroup ® Solutions, Manpower ® , Experis ® , Right Management ® , Brook Street ® , and Proservia ® have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Employees We had approximately 28,000 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we recruit millions of permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year on behalf of our clients. As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees. 9 Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions. Our business is sensitive to changes in global macroeconomic conditions, which at various times have included considerable uncertainty and volatility. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, and we are at continued risk that a downturn or a decline in economic activity globally, or in key markets, could have an adverse impact on our business. In the past, we have experienced periods during which economic conditions have been unstable and difficult to predict globally, and during which many of our operating regions experienced volatile growth patterns or declines. For example, in the latter part of 2019, the economic environment was one of slowing growth globally, including in many of our European countries. Such conditions can adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions and result in declines or declining growth rates in our business. Additionally, because country and regional economies are often interdependent, there is a risk that negative economic conditions in one market could give rise to a more widespread, or global, decline. Economic uncertainty or decline often causes our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new projects that require our solutions, or to decrease their demand for our various staffing services. If any of these trends or situations arises or intensifies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 11 Our profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. When demand drops or remains low, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline as quickly as revenues . In periods of decline , we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, during periods of decline or uncertainty, companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer . Economic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, political volatility and changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, trade disputes, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, changes in immigration policy, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. We are particularly susceptible to changes in demand patterns and economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and 66% of our revenue. In 2019, the environment has been one of revenue declines in most of our European markets, with slowing economic growth and continued tight labor markets, and there is a risk that some or many of the European economies may be hampered by events which emerged in recent years, including labor unrest, civil protest, heightened trade tensions, and the uncertainty around the transition and terms under which United Kingdom will exit the European Union. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated. Even without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. This situation can be exacerbated by uncertain and volatile economic conditions, which may cause clients to reduce or defer projects for which they utilize our services, thereby negatively affecting demand for them. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities. We may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients. There is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our diverse clients, which span all industries and whose needs may change rapidly as their businesses and industries evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 28,000 employees based out of over 2,500 offices in 75 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources to drive service improvements and to provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at anticipating or meeting the widely ranging needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 12 The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives. Our business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services. This includes expanding our sales in higher margin professional resourcing, such as our Experis brand in IT recruitment. There is a risk that our growth strategy in Experis may be impeded due to the scarcity of talent in the IT field, which is particularly in demand, and which may restrict our ability to fulfill customer requirements. Similarly, another aspect of our strategy to expand beyond our core staffing and employment services is through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. Our higher-margin Right Management career management services have historically performed well in periods of downturn, and it is part of our business strategy that this counter-cyclical effect would help cushion our results in the event of a future period of decline. However, in the event of a downturn, there can be no assurances that the margin contribution from Right Management would increase, or that it would significantly offset other declines we might experience in the business. Additionally, our workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client’s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions. Our business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant rapid disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. 13 Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We could incur liabilities, or our reputation could be damaged from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate, candidate or client data, including personal data. In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics. In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy social engineering attacks, viruses, ransomware, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks. An incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personally identifiable and confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We regularly engage an independent external security firm to assess our defenses to a potential cyberattack, and these assessments may uncover new or additional vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a compromise of our systems and/or a loss of personally identifiable information. In a recent evaluation, additional vulnerabilities were identified that could contribute to the loss of personally identifiable information. The assessment firm was able to penetrate defensive protections adopted by us, as well as protections that we obtain from third party providers. We are prioritizing the resolution of security gaps that could lead to a loss of personally identifiable information or to other damage. Despite our efforts to identify and address such vulnerabilities, there are no assurances that our efforts will be successful. There is a risk that our and our third-party vendors’ preventative security controls and practices will be inadequate to prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personally identifiable and confidential data, or fraudulent activity. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. The potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the opportunity for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and security are subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, which include the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), as well as additional legislation in place, or expected to become effective, in various US states and other countries. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, the GDPR and CCPA impose significant new compliance obligations that add costs and operational burdens to our business with respect to our collection, use, storage and retention of personal data. Compliance with these obligations could reduce operational efficiency, and failure to satisfy these requirements may lead to significant regulatory enforcement actions and/or large private litigation in the event of a security breach or other violation. Under the GDPR, the maximum fine can be up to 4% of a company’s global revenue, and there is no maximum penalty under the CCPA. 14 Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, storage, processing, disclosure, transfer, destruction or security of personally identifiable data or other privacy and security related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, or any failure to mitigate other cyberattacks or material vulnerabilities, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. The increasing discovery and/or disclosure of material vulnerabilities in various systems and components, along with the uncertainty concerning patches to those material vulnerabilities and the emergence of malware and tools to exploit those material vulnerabilities, may also have a detrimental effect on our cybersecurity posture and the ability to thwart a cyberattack. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach. We have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption, increased costs, and reputational risk. We have increasingly outsourced important processes of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs, potential disruptions to our business operations, and reputational risk. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide important back office support. We have increasingly centralized our vendor profile so that we are reliant on a small number of vendors for highly critical corporate and technology functions. While we believe these third-party vendors provide greater efficiency and expertise, our dependence on a small number of vendors, increases the risk that our business will be adversely affected if our vendors are unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Similarly, our business continuity and our margins could be adversely affected if we needed to replace one of our critical vendors for performance or economic reasons. Our operations also depend significantly upon these vendors’ and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third-party vendors’ implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations, any of which could damage our reputation in the market. If we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results. During 2019, approximately 88% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $1,073.4 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 was denominated in foreign currencies, including $1,002.9 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported results and shareholders’ equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses unless we repatriate funds. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult. 15 We seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps . A portion of our Euro-denominated notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2019 , to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective. A loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients, which comprised approximately 60% of our revenues in 2019, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted by economic conditions affecting our clients. Our working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a focus on Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase, and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer. Our performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments. Our contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our clients have become more sophisticated in their contractual negotiation process and more detailed in defining their operational requirements. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners’ ability to meet our clients’ delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability. Additionally, we may incur liability for the actions or omissions of our partners or vendors and we may face challenges or be unable to enforce these obligations against those partners. If we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer. Our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations. 16 Intense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients’ staffing needs. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. In many markets, we have been experiencing an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. This is especially acute for individuals with IT and other technology skills, as competition for such individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organization’s workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Our global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control. With operations in 75 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results. Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Moreover, many countries, including the Netherlands and Japan, have established regulations that require equal-pay for equal-work for temporary workers and fixed term employees. These new regulations could have a significant impact to our revenues, costs, and operating margins as we and customers adjust to these new regulations. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding enforcement of immigration laws, and there is a risk that we will incur greater expense in connection with immigration law compliance. The countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: • create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide; • require new or additional benefits be paid to our associates; • require pay parity for our associates; • require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or • increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes. 17 Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients. Failure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business. We are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our temporary associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business. We may be exposed to legal claims, including employment-related claims that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide variety of potential litigation and other legal claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us. For example, through our direct interaction with our clients’ businesses and facilities, including functions and systems that are sensitive or critical to their core businesses, we may be exposed to operational, regulatory, reputational and other risks specific to their business, including data security risks. These risks may be reduced through contractual provisions that limit damages or mitigate our responsibility for losses caused by our assigned workers; but these types of contractual protections are not always possible because we may perceive an important economic opportunity, because of the contracting practices of our industry competitors or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities include: • claims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients; • claims by our associates of wrongful termination or retaliation; • claims arising out of the actions or inactions of our associates, including matters for which we may have indemnified a client; • claims arising from violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; • claims related to classification of workers as employees or independent contractors; • claims related to the employment of undocumented or illegal workers; • payment of workers’ compensation claims and other similar claims; • violations of employee pay and benefits requirements such as violations of wage and hour requirements; • entitlement to employee benefits, including healthcare coverage; • errors and omissions of our associates and other individuals working on our behalf in performing their jobs, such as accountants, IT professionals, engineers and other technical workers; and • claims by our clients relating to our associates’ misuse of clients’ proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims. 18 We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business regardless of the merits of the claim. For example, in the past, we have devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based “wage and hour” claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we are frequently sued by plaintiffs in various other employment-related matters, including those seeking class action status in the US. It is likely we will continue to experience similar claims in the future. We cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our business exposes us to competition law risk. We are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate, and there is a risk that we will be subject to regulatory investigation by relevant authorities. For example, in 2009, we were fined by the French Competition Council following a 2004 investigation. As previously reported, in 2013, the French Competition Authority commenced another investigation covering ManpowerGroup and a number of our competitors in France, which was subsequently closed by the French Competition Authority in 2019. There continues to be a risk, in France and in the other countries where we operate, of inquiries by competition law regulators into how we operate our business. There is no assurance we will successfully defend against such regulatory inquiries, and they may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these matters and any future matters could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. We believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services. From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 19 Our results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs. From time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets or enter into operating joint ventures. These activities involve significant risks, including: • difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, financial reporting, services and corporate culture of acquired companies; • failure of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form, to meet performance expectations, which could trigger payment obligations; • over-valuation by us of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form; • disputes that arise with sellers; • failure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies as well as regulatory requirements; • insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions; and • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. In addition, future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges could also occur. From time to time, we may reduce our global footprint via sales, franchising, joint ventures or other exit activities, and we may face risks related to such transactions. From time to time we review the effectiveness of our global operations, including our global geographic footprint, and we may elect to exit certain countries or operations after analyzing their performance or their position in our overall global strategy. We have engaged in such dispositions in the past, and we expect that we will continue to dispose of portions of our business that are not meeting our performance or strategic objectives. Among other alternatives, this could take the form of a closure of a business, the contribution of the business to a joint venture, or an exit by means of a sale to, or a franchise arrangement with, a third party. There are risks and costs associated with any exit activities, which could include difficulties in the separation of operations, services or personnel, the diversion of management attention, and the disruption of our business. Any such transactions may require regulatory or governmental approvals, which could impede the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in, or liability with respect to, the divested businesses. As a result of divestiture transactions, we could incur severance charges for personnel and payments for lease and other commitments, charges from the impairment or write-off of assets, and other financial loss due to the transaction. Furthermore, there is the risk that we might lose customers, in particular multinational clients with operations in the exited countries or operations. Additionally, if we choose to enter into a franchise arrangement for a third party to operate our business in the exited region using our trademarks and other licensed assets, we face potential counterparty and reputational risks arising from the franchisee’s operation of the business. 20 For example, in 2019, we sold a portion of our G reater China business, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, to public shareholders through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We contributed this business to a joint venture entity in 2015, which we continued to control until the IPO transaction. As a result of the IPO, our ownership in the entity was reduced to a minority position, and our effective control over the governance and the operations of the business was eliminated . As a result, we deconsolidated the operations from our financial results. The listed entity continues to operate the Manpower branded business in the G reater China territory pursuant to a license to use our trademark and other intellectual property. There is a risk that any disputes, claims, controversies, regulatory investigations, litigation, or any activities of the joint venture entity could have an adverse reputational impact on us, as the marketplace, including clients, candidates and the media, may ascribe such issues to us, believing that we control the operations of the business within the Greater China region. We have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Our debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,073.4 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following: • we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, significant acquisition opportunities, or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing; • borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and • we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions. Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. The lenders under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, or our interest expense may increase substantially. 21 Furthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected. The performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries. Since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances. Our inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries. In a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business . In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may disagree in the future, with our judgments. Many taxing authorities are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states. Among other things, the directives require companies to provide increased country-by-country disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities, which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them. These possible change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, could have an adverse impact on our current or future tax positions. 22 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors. The market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2019, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $97.36 to a low of $63.72. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these “Risk Factors” and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: • changes in general economic conditions; • actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; • announcement of new services by us or our competitors; • announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; • changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and • changes in investor sentiment regarding the company arising from these or other events, or the economy in general. Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult. Certain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include: • permitting removal of directors only for cause; • providing that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and • requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees. In addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin’s “fair price” and “business combination” provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties We own properties at various locations worldwide, none of which are material. Most of our operations are conducted from leased premises and we do not anticipate any difficulty in renewing these leases or in finding alternative sites in the ordinary course of business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are involved in litigation of a routine nature and various legal matters, which are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 23 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF MANPOWERGROUP (as of February 19, 2020) Name of Officer Office Jonas Prising Age 55 Chairman of ManpowerGroup as of December 31, 2015.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Common Stock Listing and Trading The Company's common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MAN. Shareholders of Record As of February 19, 2020, the Company's common stock was held by approximately 2,800 record holders. Dividend Policy While we currently expect that future semi-annual dividends will continue to be paid, our dividend policy is subject to review and change at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may depend upon, among other factors, earnings, financial condition, and other requirements. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In August 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 6.0 million shares of our common stock. We conduct share repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. The following table shows the total amount of shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, there were 6.0 million and 0.8 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and 2018 authorization, respectively.

As of and for the Year Ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Operations Data Revenues from services $ 20,863.5 $ 21,991.2 $ 21,034.3 $ 19,654.1 $ 19,329.9 Gross profit 3,375.1 3,579.0 3,484.6 3,333.8 3,295.8 Operating profit 644.9 796.7 789.2 745.5 693.1 Net earnings 465.7 556.7 545.4 443.7 419.2 Per Share Data Net earnings — basic $ 7.78 $ 8.62 $ 8.13 $ 6.33 $ 5.46 Net earnings — diluted 7.72 8.56 8.04 6.27 5.40 Dividends 2.18 2.02 1.86 1.72 1.60 Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 9,223.8 $ 8,519.8 $ 8,883.6 $ 7,574.2 $ 7,517.5 Long-term debt 1,012.4 1,025.3 478.1 785.6 810.9 28 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Measures — Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included on page 37. Results of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 The financial discussion that follows focuses on 2019 results compared to 2018. For a discussion of 2018 results compared to 2017, see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . During 2019, the United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in the majority of our markets than in 2018, and subsequently was having an unfavorable impact on our reported results. This strengthening was particularly pronounced against the Euro and British Pound. Our reported revenues from services decreased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018 and our reported operating profit decreased 19.1%. Given the relative weakness of other currencies against the United States dollar in 2019 compared to the 2018, these results generally may understate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 4.2% unfavorable impact on revenues from services, a 3.5% unfavorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.28 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share - diluted. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. 29 In 2019, the environment has been one of revenue declines in most of our European markets, with slow ing economic growth globally and continued tight labor markets in many countries that has overshadow ed modest constant currency growth elsewhere. Over the course of the year, we experienced the following changes to o ur consolidated revenues : first quarter constant currency revenue decrease of 2.2%, 0.1% decrease in constant currency in the second quarter, 0.3% constant currency increase in the third quarter, with a deterioration in the fourth quarter to a 1.8 % constant currency decrease. We remain highly focused on our business in Europe, where Southern and Northern Europe segments combined reflect 66% of our total consolidated revenues. In 2019, several key markets within Southern and Northern Europe experienced revenue declines, partially offset by constant currency revenue increases in certain markets within the Americas and APME. We experienced a revenue decline in organic constant currency in Southern Europe due to the revenue decline s in France and Italy, partially offset by organic constant currency revenue growth in certain markets within Other Southern Europe. The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the decrease s in Germany , the Netherlands, and Sweden due mostly to reduced demand from the manufacturing sector in those markets and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts . In the Americas, revenues increased 3.6 % in constant currency due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within Other Americas and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. These increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in the United States primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim due to the challenging manufacturing environment . Our gross profit margin in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the decreased margins in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, particularly within our Talent Based Outsourcing business, partially offset by a favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Our operating profit decreased 19.1% in 2019 (-15.6% in constant currency and -14.4% in organic constant currency) while our operating profit margin decreased 50 basis points compared to 2018. Included in 2019 and 2018 were $39.8 million and $39.3 million, respectively, of restructuring costs. The 2019 restructuring costs were primarily related to our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations. The 2018 restructuring costs were primarily related to the integration of certain acquisitions and front-office, back-office and delivery-model optimization. We recorded $64.0 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our investments in Germany and New Zealand ($60.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively) and additional charges of $1.6 million related to our New Zealand operations in 2019. ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, which operates in the Greater China region of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) on the Hong Kong Stock Market on July 10, 2019, resulting in deconsolidation of the entity. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a non-cash accounting gain of $30.4 million (see further information in Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited’s results through July 10, 2019, were included in our 2019 consolidated results. Excluding the restructuring costs in both 2019 and 2018, the goodwill impairment and other related charges and the IPO noncash accounting gain, our operating profit was down 8.5% in organic constant currency with operating profit margin down 30 basis points compared to 2018. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities. Although 2019 was a challenging year, we have made good progress advancing the key initiatives that we believe will position us well for future revenue growth. We anticipate the overall strength of labor markets will continue, though not evenly distributed across regions and industries, amidst high levels of talent shortage and changing client skill needs due to the increased pace of technological and transformational changes. Despite headwinds from geopolitical forces, including the adverse impact of global trade conflict on growth and employment in the manufacturing sector, we believe we are well-positioned to help our clients address these challenges with our market-leading global footprint and our portfolio of solutions and services. In early 2020, there has been potential progress on trade agreements, but even if trade issues are resolved, we anticipate that instability resulting from trade policies may continue to impact our business for a period of time, particularly within the manufacturing sector. If consumer confidence remains at high levels, supported by low unemployment levels in many of our key countries, we expect our outlook will be stable over the coming several quarters. 30 Consolidated Results - 2019 compared to 2018 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2019 as compared to 2018. (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Reported Variance Variance in Constant Currency Variance in Organic Constant Currency Revenues from services $ 20,863.5 $ 21,991.2 (5.1 )% (0.9 )% (1.0 )% Cost of services 17,488.4 18,412.2 (5.0 ) (0.8 ) Gross profit 3,375.1 3,579.0 (5.7 ) (1.8 ) (1.3 ) Gross profit margin 16.2 % 16.3 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charge 2,666.2 2,782.3 Goodwill impairment charge 64.0 — Selling and administrative expenses 2,730.2 2,782.3 (1.9 ) 2.2 2.4 Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues 13.1 % 12.7 % Operating profit 644.9 796.7 (19.1 ) (15.6 ) (14.4 ) Operating profit margin 3.1 % 3.6 % Net interest expense 38.4 41.0 Other (income) expenses, net (79.0 ) 1.0 Earnings before income taxes 685.5 754.7 (9.2 ) (5.7 ) Provision for income taxes 219.8 198.0 11.1 Effective income tax rate 32.1 % 26.2 % Net earnings $ 465.7 $ 556.7 (16.4 ) (13.3 ) Net earnings per share - diluted $ 7.72 $ 8.56 (9.8 ) (6.5 ) Weighted average shares - diluted 60.3 65.1 (7.3 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 5.1% (-0.9% in constant currency and -1.0% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • decreased demand for services in several of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 12.6% (-7.6% in constant currency and -6.8% in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services due to low levels of manufacturing activity and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts, and the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018. We experienced revenue declines in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Nordics of 25.2%, 24.7%, 10.2%, 4.4%, and 10.1% (-21.1%, -20.5%, -5.3%, -0.1%, and -2.6%, respectively, in constant currency; -16.7% and -1.4% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands and the Nordics, respectively); • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 2.2% (increase of 2.8% in constant currency; -0.8% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 6.3% (-1.2% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and a slight decrease in our Manpower staffing revenues, partially offset by increased demand in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and the additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland in April 2019. The Southern Europe decrease also included a decrease in Italy of 9.8% (-4.9% in constant currency) due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by a 4.3% increase (10.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business; • a revenue decrease in the United States of 0.6% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services, partially offset by additional revenues as a result of franchise acquisitions in August and October 2019; • a revenue decrease in APME of 9.1% (-7.2% in constant currency; increase of 3.7% in organic constant currency) due to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019 (the “Deconsolidation”), the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues; 31 • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 1.6 % ( increase of 0.9 % in constant currency), as our outplacement services were flat (increase of 2.6 % in constant currency ) , and we experienced a 7.3 % decrease (- 5.1 % in constant currency) in our talent management business; and • a 4.2% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 10 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from the declining margins in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, particularly within our Talent Based Outsourcing business; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The 1.9% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in 2019 (increase of 2.2% in constant currency and 2.4% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • the $30.4 million gain related to the Deconsolidation; • a 7.0% decrease (-3.8% constant currency and -4.2% in organic constant currency) in office-related costs primarily due to a decrease in the number of offices as a result of our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations, and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates; • a 3.6% decrease (increase of 0.3% in constant currency and 0.5% organic constant currency) in personnel costs primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in headcount to support the increase in revenues in certain markets within the Americas, Southern Europe, and APME; and • the reduction in recurring selling and administrative costs of $44.5 million as a result of the Deconsolidation in July 2019 and dispositions in December 2018 in Northern Europe and APME; partially offset by • goodwill impairment and related charges of $65.6 million related to our Germany reporting unit and New Zealand operations in 2019; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $39.0 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe and franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019; and • restructuring costs of $39.8 million incurred in 2019, comprised of $5.1 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $18.7 million in Northern Europe, $4.4 million in APME, $4.7 million in Right Management, and $1.5 million in corporate expenses, compared to $39.3 million incurred in 2018, comprised of $0.3 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $33.3 million in Northern Europe and $0.3 million in Right Management. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 40 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of: • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact from the goodwill impairment and other related charges; • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact as expenses increased slightly, excluding the goodwill impairment and other related charges, restructuring costs and the Deconsolidation gain, while our revenues declined on an organic constant currency basis; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from the Deconsolidation gain. Interest and other (income) expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other (income) expenses, net was income of $40.6 million in 2019 compared to expenses of $42.0 million in 2018. Net interest expense decreased $2.6 million in 2019 to $38.4 million from $41.0 million in 2018 due to the lower interest rate on our €500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Miscellaneous income increased to $85.7 million in 2019 from $0.4 million in 2018 primarily due to the gain of $80.4 million related to our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in our Swiss franchise and an increase in income from the equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited subsequent to the Deconsolidation, partially offset by the decrease in the income from the equity investment in Switzerland prior to the acquisition. 32 We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.1% in 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 26.2% in 2018. The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. These items were partially offset by a one-time tax benefit related to the refinancing of an intercompan y lending arrangement . The 32.1% effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the French business tax, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. In 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately 34% due primarily to the exclusion of the one-time tax benefit related to the refinancing of an intercompany lending arrangement . Net earnings per share - diluted was $7.72 in 2019 compared to $8.56 in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.28 in 2019. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.32 per share. Goodwill impairment and related tax and other charges recorded in 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.26. The gain from the Deconsolidation recorded in 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.50 per share. In 2019 and 2018, restructuring costs negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.52 and $0.46 per share, net of tax. The gain from the sale of the Netherlands' language translation business favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06 per share, net of tax, for 2018. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased 7.3% to 60.3 million in 2019 from 65.1 million in 2018. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2018, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2019. Segment Results We evaluate performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. Effective January 2020, our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. We will report on the new realigned segments beginning in the first quarter of 2020. All previously reported results will be restated to conform to the new presentation. Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 0.6% (3.6% in constant currency and 3.1% in organic constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 0.6% (-1.4% on an organic basis) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services in a challenging manufacturing environment, partially offset by a 5.2% increase in our permanent recruitment business, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering, and the additional revenues as a result of franchise acquisitions in August and October 2019. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 2.3% (10.0% in constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, and Peru of 2.2%, 13.7%, and 17.3%, respectively (2.4%, 16.3%, and 19.0%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil of 28.8%, 2.3% and 5.6%, respectively (increases of 26.0%, 8.5% and 2.5%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. 33 Gross profit margin was flat for 2019 compared to 2018 . We experienced an increase in our United States staffing/interim margin due to pricing discipline and lower payroll tax and insurance costs. Gross profit margin also increased due to the increase of 4.8 % ( 6.2 % in constant currency and 5.9% in organic constant currency ) in the permanent recruitment business in 2019 compared to 2018. The gross profit margin increases in 2019 compared to 2018 were offset by the decreases in the staffing/interim gross profit margins within certain markets within Other Americas. In 2019, selling and administrative expenses increased 3.8% (6.3% in constant currency; 5.8% in organic constant currency), due primarily to an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount related to growth initiatives, and an increase in restructuring costs to $5.1 million in 2019 from $0.3 million in 2018. OUP margin in the Americas was 4.5% and 4.9% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin was 4.5% and 5.2% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The margin decrease in the United States was primarily due to increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives, partially offset by an improvement in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 4.4% in 2019 from 4.5% in 2018 due primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs and increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. Southern Europe In 2019, revenues from services in Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, decreased 2.2% (increase of 2.8% in constant currency; -0.8% in organic constant currency) compared to 2018. In 2019, revenues from services decreased 6.3% (-1.2% in constant currency) in France (which represents 60% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 9.8% (-4.9% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 16% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. The decrease in Italy was due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day and a 4.3% increase (10.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 17.5% (21.9% in constant currency and 4.1% in organic constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the additional revenue from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 7.9% (12.6% in constant currency and 4.5% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased in 2019 compared to 2018, partially due to the favorable direct cost adjustments and various initiatives undertaken to address the unfavorable impact from transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program and the improvement of the staffing/interim gross profit margin in Italy. The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program. The Southern Europe gross profit margin also increased due to growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 2.3% increase (7.6% in constant currency and 4.6% in organic constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2019, selling and administrative expenses increased 0.4% (5.5% in constant currency and 1.4% in organic constant currency) compared to 2018, primarily due to the additional recurring costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland and an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.0% in both 2019 and 2018. In France, the OUP margin increased to 5.2% in 2019 from 5.0% in 2018, primarily due to improvement in the gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in salary-related expenses. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 6.8% in 2019 from 6.7% in 2018, primarily due to the improvement in the gross profit margin, partially offset by expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline. In Other Southern Europe, OUP margin decreased to 3.1% in 2019 comparted to 3.5% in 2018, due to a decline in the gross profit margin and increase in salary-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs. 34 Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 33%, 17%, 21%, 12% and 9%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 12.6% (-7.6% in constant currency and -6.8% in organic constant currency) in 2019 as compared to 2018. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 4.4%, 25.2%, 10.1%, 24.7% and 10.2%, respectively (-0.1%, -21.1%, -2.6%, -20.5% and -5.3%, respectively, in constant currency; -1.4% and -16.7% in organic constant currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands, respectively). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market, decreases in our staffing/interim services in the Netherlands due to a reduction in manufacturing-related demand and the exit from certain client contracts as a result of pricing decisions, decreased demand in Sweden related to lower activity from our manufacturing clients, and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts. This decrease was also due to a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018 and the 10.8% decrease (-5.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. These decreases were partially offset by an increased demand for our staffing/interim services in Norway. Gross profit margin decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes, lower associate utilization and higher vacation and sickness rates in Germany, and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 12.9% (-7.7% in constant currency and -6.6% in organic constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018, due to the decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices, a decrease in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities incurred in the latter part of 2018 and a decrease in restructuring costs to $19.8 million in 2019 from $33.3 million in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the $8.4 million gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands in 2018. The 2019 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium. The 2018 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 1.4% in 2019 from 2.3% in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. APME Revenues from services decreased 9.1% (-7.2% in constant currency and an increase of 3.7% in organic constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018. In Japan (which represents 37% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 6.9% (5.5% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, and a 9.5% increase (8.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of five fewer billing days in 2019 compared to 2018. In Australia (which represents 16% of APME’s revenues), revenue from services decreased 25.0% (-19.1% in constant currency) as we chose to exit certain low-margin Manpower business to improve profitability, and due to the 6.8% decrease (increase of 0.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the Deconsolidation and disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, partially offset by increased demand for Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Korea and Thailand. Gross profit margin decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 18.6% (-14.7% in constant currency; increase of 0.4% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the increase in our staffing/interim margin, due primarily to the improvement in Japan, and the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China in December 2018. 35 Selling and administrative expenses de creased 15.3 % ( - 12.7 % in constant currency and - 2.1 % in organic constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018 . The de crease is primarily due to the gain from the D econsolidation, the reduction of recurring selling and administrative costs as a result of the D econsolidation and disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China in December 2018, and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs to support the increase in revenues in certain markets . OUP margin for APME increased to 4.7% in 2019 compared to 4.0% in 2018 due to the gain from the Deconsolidation, partially offset by the decline in the gross profit margin and an increase in restructuring costs. Right Management In 2019, revenues from services for Right Management decreased 1.6% (increase of 0.9% in constant currency). The decrease is primarily due to the 7.3% decrease (-5.1% in constant currency) in our talent management services due mostly to softening demand in our European and Asian markets and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Our outplacement business was flat (increase of 2.6% in constant currency) in 2019 compared to 2018 as the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates was offset by increased demand in our European and Asian markets. Gross profit margin decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in both our outplacement business gross profit margin, partially offset by the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a higher percentage of the revenue mix and an increase in our talent management business gross profit margin. In 2019, selling and administrative expenses decreased 0.9% (increase of 1.5% in constant currency) compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the number of offices, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs to $4.7 million in 2019 from $0.3 million in 2018. OUP margin for Right Management decreased to 15.3% in 2019 compared to 16.4% in 2018 due to the decline in the gross profit margin and the increase in restructuring costs. 36 Financial Measures Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Certain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2019, we had $894.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund corporate activities. With the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we have no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2019, deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,867.0 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $8.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We have an additional $371.5 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes. Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate. Cash provided by operating activities was $814.4 million, $483.1 million and $400.9 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $313.2 million of cash in 2019 compared to $198.3 million and $78.9 million utilized in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in 2019 from 2018 is primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments, a decrease in CICE receivables resulting from the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019, and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the original liability recorded at acquisition date for the acquisitions in the Netherlands. The increase was partially offset by lower net proceeds from the sale of our CICE payroll tax credits. The change in 2018 from 2017 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date. The CICE payroll tax credits are creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2019, we sold a portion of our CICE earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $103.5 million (€92.0 million) with the remaining amount to be used against future tax payments. In April 2018 and March 2017, we sold substantially all of our CICE earned in 2017 and 2016, respectively, for net proceeds of $234.5 million (€190.9 million) and $143.5 million (€133.0 million), respectively. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,273.1 million as of December 31, 2019 from $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018. This decrease is due to changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") decreased by approximately one day from December 31, 2018. Capital expenditures were $52.9 million, $64.7 million and $54.7 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $2.0 million in 2019, $5.6 million in 2018 and $1.7 million in 2017. The higher expenditures in 2018 compared to 2019 was primarily due to additional technology investment and the timing of capital expenditures. 38 On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $219.5 million and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $161.2 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate cash consideration paid reflects a post-closing settlement of net debt and net working capital adjustments of $6.8 million , which we paid out during the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $415.1 million, or $97.6 million net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million, which is included within interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million, $32.5 million represented foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest from accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill resulting from the Manpower Switzerland acquisition was $44.5 million and $34.2 million, respectively. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $47.7 million , $51.8 million and $45.7 million, respectively. The 2019 balance includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $13.0 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million , of which $18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $32.7 million and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $13.0 million , of which $10.3 million was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S Group GmbH (""7S"") in Germany. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2019 acquisitions, excluding Manpower Switzerland, were $14.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $6.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25% of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25%, and then further diluted to 36.87% as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $30.4 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the $30.4 million was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $6.2 million related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive income. 39 Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies . In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for net cash proceeds of $13.2 million and divested a majority interest in a consolidated entity in China with an immaterial cash impact. Cash provided by net debt borrowings was $19.5 million, $178.2 million and $5.2 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In June 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026, with the net proceeds of €495.7 million predominantly used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018. (See the ""Euro Notes"" section below for further information.) The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2019, August 2018 and July 2016. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2019, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $203.0 million under the 2018 authorization. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 million. In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $203.9 under the 2016 authorization. As of December 31, 2019, there were 6.0 million and 0.8 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and 2018 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized under the 2016 authorization. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $2.18, $2.02 and $1.86 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $129.3 million, $127.3 million and $123.7 million, respectively. We have aggregate commitments of $2,152.3 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows: (in millions) Total 2020 2021–2022 2023–2024 Thereafter Long-term debt including interest $ 1,106.5 $ 18.2 $ 491.1 $ 21.7 $ 575.5 Short-term borrowings 61.0 61.0 — — — Operating leases 503.9 133.8 181.4 92.7 96.0 Severances and other office closure costs 7.3 5.9 1.3 0.1 — Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act 124.9 11.6 23.8 52.2 37.3 Other 348.7 128.0 153.3 30.6 36.8 $ 2,152.3 $ 358.5 $ 850.9 $ 197.3 $ 745.6 Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $50.5 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled. We recorded net restructuring costs of $42.0 million and $39.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve was $50.2 million and $37.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect a majority of the remaining $7.3 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. We have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $845.0 million as of December 31, 2019 ($793.4 million for guarantees and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.7 million for 2019. 40 Total capitalization as of December 31, 201 9 was $ 3,834.9 million, comprised of $ 1 , 073 . 4 million in debt and $ 2 , 761 . 5 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 28% as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018 and 25% as of December 31, 2017. Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the “€500.0 million notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 million notes of €495.7 million were used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the €500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the ""€400.0 million notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million notes or the €400.0 million notes. Both the €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2019. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement On June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five-Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.8 million annually. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. 41 As defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0. 5 7 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5. 0 1 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 201 9 . Other In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2019, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $324.1 million, of which $253.6 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $229.5 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2019. Our long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $17.2 million, $13.9 million and $11.2 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $33.0 million in 2020. The increase in 2020 estimated pension expense is primarily due to the settlement of a U.S. pension plan in February 2020. The calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact annual expense recorded related to the plans. In determining the estimated 2020 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 1.1% compared to 1.8% for 2019, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 2.2% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2020 estimated pension expense compared to 2.7% used for the calculation of the 2019 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would impact our 2020 consolidated pension expense by a decrease of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.7 million, respectively. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would correspondingly decrease or increase our 2020 consolidated pension expense by $1.4 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) 42 Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. The accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not meet the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements. We provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year. In December 2017, the Tax Act made broad changes to the United States tax code, including a reduction of the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and a transition to a Territorial Tax regime resulting in a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted post-1986 non-United States earnings. The Tax Act also established new provisions related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI""), Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) and a Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (“BEAT”). The computation of these new provisions is highly complex, and our estimates could significantly change as a result of new rules or guidance from the various standard-setting bodies. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be a component of the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2019 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote down the carrying value of the Germany reporting unit down to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $60.2 million during the second quarter of 2019. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.8 million related to our New Zealand operations as a result of it not meeting profitability expectations. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2019, 2018 and 2017, and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests. 43 The table below provides our reporting units ’ estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 80 % of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2019 . (in millions) France United States United Kingdom Right Management Germany Canada Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 2,723.2 $ 1,386.4 $ 407.6 308.9 $ 265.8 $ 184.2 $ 158.7 Carrying values 1,302.9 801.5 337.2 126.6 262.8 92.0 129.1 The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20% in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Germany reporting unit. Key assumptions included in the Germany discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2019 included a discount rate of 10.8% and a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2%. Should the operations of the business incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, some or all of the recorded goodwill, which was $64.8 million as of September 30, 2019, could be subject to impairment. 44 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations Market Risks We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Exchange Rates Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries and our Euro-denominated borrowings. For our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rates impact the United States dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in the subsidiaries and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries. Approximately 88% of our revenues and profits are generated outside of the United States, with 48% generated from our European operations with a Euro-functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, particularly the Euro, may have a significant impact on our reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates each month. Consequently, as the value of the United States dollar changes relative to the currencies of our major markets, our reported results vary. The United States dollar generally strengthened against many of the currencies of our major markets in 2019, whereas it generally weakened in 2018. Revenues from services in constant currency were 4.2% higher and 2.0% lower than reported revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. A change in the strength of the United States dollar by an additional 10% would have impacted our revenues from services by approximately 8.8% from the amounts reported in both 2019 and 2018. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the United States dollar amount of our shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of our non-United States subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, while it weakened against certain currencies in which we hold significant balances. Consequently, shareholders’ equity increased by $22.5 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2019. If the United States dollar had weakened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2019, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have increased by approximately $186.2 million from the amounts reported. As of December 31, 2018, the United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies compared to December 31, 2017. Consequently, shareholders’ equity decreased by $108.7 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2018. If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2018, resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have decreased by approximately $198.5 million from the amounts reported. Although currency fluctuations impact our reported results and shareholders’ equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. We generally have few cross-border transfers of funds, except for transfers to the United States for payment of license fees and interest expense on intercompany loans, working capital loans made between the United States and our foreign subsidiaries, dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, and payments between certain countries and territories for services provided. To reduce the currency risk related to these transactions, we may borrow funds in the relevant foreign currency under our revolving credit agreement or we may enter into a forward contract to hedge the transfer. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding $1,002.9 million in principal amount of Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2019. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ equity increased by $17.7 million, net of tax, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2019, due to the currency impact on these designated borrowings. 45 The hypothetical impact of the stated change in rates on 2019 total other comprehensive income (loss) for the Euro Notes is as follows: 2019 (in millions) Market Sensitive Instrument 10% Depreciation in Exchange Rates Euro Notes: €500.0, 1.81% Notes due June 2026 $ 56.1 €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 44.9 Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we had the following fixed- and variable-rate borrowings: (in millions) Amount Weighted- Average Interest Rate (1) Variable-rate borrowings $ 61.0 7.7 % Fixed-rate borrowings 1,012.4 1.9 Total debt $ 1,073.4 2.2 % (1) The rates are impacted by currency exchange rate movements. Impact of Economic Conditions One of the principal attractions of using workforce solutions and service providers is to maintain a flexible supply of labor to meet changing economic conditions. Therefore, the industry has been and remains sensitive to economic cycles. To help minimize the effects of these economic cycles, we offer clients a continuum of services to meet their needs throughout the business cycle. We believe that the breadth of our operations and the diversity of our service mix cushion us against the impact of an adverse economic cycle in any single country or industry. However, adverse economic conditions in any of our largest markets, or in several markets simultaneously, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 21, 2020 48 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ManpowerGroup Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases, effective January 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the modified retrospective transition approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill - Germany, United Kingdom, United States, and Netherlands Reporting Units – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The annual impairment test of goodwill at a reporting unit level is performed annually during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its respective carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate 49 fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both . During the second quarter of 2019 the company identified circumstances that caused it to evaluate the goodwill associated with the Germany reporting unit for potential impairment. The Company updated their cash flow estimates as of June 30, 2019 to reflect current market conditions and as a result of the test recorded a $60.2 million impairment of goodwill based on the excess of the Germany reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining goodwill balance for the Germany reporting unit was $67.2 million. Subsequent to the impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill during the third quarter. Because the estimated fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values, no additional impairments were recorded. Given that forecasted revenues and operating unit profit margins for the Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in demand, sales and customer mix, and efficiency of operations, and considering the low excess fair value of these reporting units, auditing these assumptions and the selection of the discount rates involved especially subjective judgment. As a result, we identified the Company’s evaluations of goodwill impairment for the Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States reporting units as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment and the increased extent of effort that was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of revenue and operating unit profit margins, as well as the selection of discount rates, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenues and operating unit profit margins (“forecasts”), and the selection of discount rates for the Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States reporting units included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill, including controls over the forecasts related to revenue and operating unit profit margin and selection of discount rates. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast revenue and operating unit margins by performing a retrospective review of prior forecasts compared to actual results. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and operating unit margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) forecasted information included in Company press releases, analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s fair value estimate by: o Developing an independent range of fair values based on market multiples of similar companies and comparing this to the company’s estimated fair values. o Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. o Developing a range of independent estimates of discount rates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 21, 2020 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005. 50 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS in millions, except per share data Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Revenues from services $ 20,863.5 $ 21,991.2 $ 21,034.3 Cost of services 17,488.4 18,412.2 17,549.7 Gross profit 3,375.1 3,579.0 3,484.6 Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charge 2,666.2 2,782.3 2,695.4 Goodwill impairment charge 64.0 — — Selling and administrative expenses 2,730.2 2,782.3 2,695.4 Operating profit 644.9 796.7 789.2 Interest and other (income) expenses, net ( 40.6 ) 42.0 51.9 Earnings before income taxes 685.5 754.7 737.3 Provision for income taxes 219.8 198.0 191.9 Net earnings $ 465.7 $ 556.7 $ 545.4 Net earnings per share - basic $ 7.78 $ 8.62 $ 8.13 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 7.72 $ 8.56 $ 8.04 Weighted average shares - basic 59.9 64.6 67.1 Weighted average shares - diluted 60.3 65.1 67.9 The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

and per share data (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations ManpowerGroup Inc. is a world leader in the innovative workforce solutions and services industry. Our global network of over 2,500 offices in 75 countries and territories allows us to meet the needs of our global, multinational and local clients across all major industry segments. Our largest operations, based on revenues, are located in France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. We specialize in permanent, temporary and contract recruitment and assessment; training and development; outsourcing; career management and workforce consulting services. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include our operating results and the operating results of all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and the noncontrolling shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, or we have significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for equity investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our ownership share of earnings of these equity method investments, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments, as well as certain other relationships, are also evaluated for consolidation under the accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. These investments were $ 97.8 and $ 161.4 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are $ 3.4 and $ 105.2 , respectively, of unremitted earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method. The decreases in the amounts above relate to our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in our Swiss franchise. The remaining amounts as of December 31, 2019 relate to accounting for our remaining interest in ManpowerGroup Greater China under the equity method subsequent to deconsolidation (see Note 4 for further information). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenues As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on revenue recognition using the modified retrospective approach applied to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with previous accounting guidance. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption as there were no significant revenue recognition differences identified between the new and previous accounting guidance. We recognize revenues when control of the promised services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of any sales, value added, or other taxes collected from our clients. 55 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service to the client, and it is the unit of account in the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in our contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. However, we have multiple performance obligations within our Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) contracts as discussed below. For performance obligations that we satisfy over time, revenues are recognized by consistently applying a method of measuring progress toward satisfaction of that performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time (e.g., hours, weeks, months) of service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of each performance obligation. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices included in the client contracts, using expected costs plus margin, or other observable prices. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Certain client contracts have variable consideration, including credits, sales allowances, rebates or other similar items that generally reduce the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration using whichever method, either the expected value method or most likely amount method, better predicts the amount of consideration to which we will become entitled based on the terms of the client contract and historical evidence. These amounts may be constrained and are only included in revenues to the extent we do not expect a significant reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our variable consideration amounts are not material, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates. Our client contracts generally include standard payment terms acceptable in each of the countries and territories in which we operate. The payment terms vary by the type and location of our clients and services offered. Client payments are typically due approximately 60 days after invoicing but may be a shorter or longer term depending on the contract. Our client contracts are generally short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. The timing between satisfaction of the performance obligation, invoicing and payment is not significant. For certain services and client types, we may require payment prior to delivery of services to the client, for which deferred revenue is recorded. In certain scenarios where a third-party vendor is involved in our revenue transactions with our clients, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent in the transaction. In situations where we act as principal in the transaction, we control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as gross revenues and cost of services. When we act as agent in the transaction, we do not control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as revenues on a net basis. A majority of these agent transactions occur within our TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) programs where our performance obligation is to manage our client’s contingent workforce, and we earn a commission based on the amount of staffing services that are managed through the program. We are the agent in these transactions as we do not control the third-party providers' staffing services provided to the client through our MSP program prior to those services being transferred to the client. For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. As allowed under the new guidance, we do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to December 31, 2019 related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 44.5 at December 31, 2019 and $ 42.8 at December 31, 2018. We recognized the entire amount of the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. 56 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration for historical write-off experience, the current aging of receivables and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. Bad debt expense is recorded as selling and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and was $ 21.8 , $ 23.0 and $ 18.1 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by our clients and other difficulties collecting amounts billed. On the other hand, an improved write-off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision. Write-offs were $ 19.1 , $ 12.0 and $ 17.6 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Advertising Costs We expense production costs of advertising as they are incurred. Advertising expenses were $ 25.7 , $ 27.9 and $ 26.6 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 42.0 , $ 39.3 and $ 34.5 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve was $ 50.2 and $ 37.3 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 7.3 reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2017 $ 1.7 $ 0.9 $ 9.6 $ — $ 1.2 $ 0.1 $ 13.5 Severance costs 0.3 5.4 25.8 — 0.3 — 31.8 Office closure costs — — 7.5 — — — 7.5 Costs paid or utilized ( 1.7 ) ( 4.6 ) ( 29.8 ) — ( 1.1 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 37.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 0.3 $ 1.7 $ 13.1 $ — $ 0.4 $ — $ 15.5 Severance costs 3.6 5.2 17.6 3.5 0.2 2.3 32.4 Office closure costs (3) 1.3 0.1 2.0 0.9 4.5 0.8 9.6 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out (3) ( 4.8 ) ( 6.3 ) ( 26.5 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 5.1 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 50.2 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 0.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ — $ — $ — $ 7.3 (1) Balance related to United States was $ 1.5 as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, United States paid/utilized $ 1.2 , leaving a $ 0.3 liability as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, United States incurred $ 1.1 for severance costs and $ 1.3 for office closure costs and paid/utilized $ 2.4 , leaving a $ 0.3 liability as of December 31, 2019. (2) Balance related to France was $ 0.9 as of both December 31, 2017 and 2018. In 2019, France paid/utilized $ 0.9 , leaving no liability as of December 31, 2019. Italy had no restructuring reserves recorded as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, Italy incurred $ 1.9 for severance costs and paid/utilized $ 1.4 , leaving a $ 0.5 liability as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, Italy incurred $ 2.3 for severance costs and paid/utilized $ 2.5 , leaving a $ 0.3 liability as of December 31, 2019. (3) The office closure costs of $ 9.6 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining liability of $ 3.2 related to office closures is recorded in current operating lease liabilities. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 57 Fair Value Measurements The assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Deferred compensation plan assets $ 107.3 $ 107.3 $ — $ — $ 89.5 $ 89.5 $ — $ — Cross-currency swaps 9.7 — 9.7 — — — — — Foreign currency forward contracts — — — — 0.1 — 0.1 — $ 117.0 $ 107.3 $ 9.7 $ — $ 89.6 $ 89.5 $ 0.1 $ — Liabilities Cross-currency swaps $ 6.0 $ — $ 6.0 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Foreign currency forward contracts — — — — 0.1 — 0.1 — $ 6.0 $ — $ 6.0 $ — $ 0.1 $ — $ 0.1 $ — We determine the fair value of our deferred compensation plan assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are measured at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable third parties. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,062.5 and $ 1,052.9 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,002.9 and $ 1,024.6 , respectively. 58 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We had goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,260.1 $ — $ 1,260.1 $ 1,297.1 $ — $ 1,297.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 460.5 $ 375.7 $ 84.8 $ 444.8 $ 351.7 $ 93.1 Other 20.9 13.7 7.2 18.5 16.0 2.5 481.4 389.4 92.0 463.3 367.7 95.6 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 124.6 — 124.6 98.7 — 98.7 176.6 — 176.6 150.7 — 150.7 Total intangible assets $ 658.0 $ 389.4 $ 268.6 $ 614.0 $ 367.7 $ 246.3 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 577.4 and $ 513.4 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. The consolidated amortization expense related to intangibles was $ 29.8 , $ 35.1 and $ 34.6 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense expected in each of the next five years related to acquisitions completed as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: 2020 - $ 26.6 , 2021 - $ 16.2 , 2022 - $ 12.8 , 2023 - $ 10.0 and 2024 - $ 7.8 . The weighted-average useful lives of the customer relationships and other are approximately 14 and 4 years, respectively. The tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the tradenames, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Indefinite-lived reacquired franchise rights resulted from our franchise acquisitions in the United States, Switzerland and Canada. These rights entitled the franchisees with unilateral control to operate perpetually in particular territories, and have therefore been assigned an indefinite life. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland.) In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019, 2018 and 2017, and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible as a result of our annual tests. We determine the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing an income approach derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. The income approach is developed from management’s forecasted cash flow data. Significant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2019 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit (“OUP”) margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 9.9 % to 13.1 %, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and OUP margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and OUP margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We would record a goodwill impairment charge by the amount for which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. We are also required to test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. 59 For the second quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included a further downward trend in the performance of the business due to current market conditions, a more cautious outlook for the business stemming from the impact of changes to temporary staffing regulations in Germany, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our Germany deferred tax assets during the second quarter. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2019. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 60.2 during the second quarter of 2019. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to our New Zealand operations as a result of it not meeting profitability expectations. The New Zealand reporting unit is included in the APME segment. Marketable Securities Prior to April 2019, when we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise to obtain full ownership of the entity, we accounted for our 49 % interest in our Swiss franchise under the equity method of accounting. The Swiss franchise maintained an investment portfolio with a market value of $ 219.9 as of December 31, 2018. The portfolio was comprised of a wide variety of European and United States debt and equity securities and various professionally-managed funds, all of which were classified as available-for-sale, as well as cash and cash equivalents. Since January 1, 2018, upon adoption of the new accounting guidance on financial instruments, we recognized all the changes in fair value on the investment portfolio in the current period earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, only our share of net realized gains and losses, and declines in value determined to be other-than-temporary, was included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our share of net unrealized gains and unrealized losses that were determined to be temporary related to these investments was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with the offsetting amount increasing or decreasing our investment in the franchise. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, realized gains totaled $ 0.3 , $ 12.7 and $ 14.7 , respectively, and realized losses totaled $ 0.2 , $ 2.1 and $ 3.8 , respectively. Other-than-temporary impairment amounts were insignificant for 2019, 2018 and 2017. Capitalized Software for Internal Use We capitalize purchased software as well as internally developed software. Internal software development costs are capitalized from the time when the internal-use software is considered probable of completion until the software is ready for use. Business analysis, system evaluation, selection and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software which ranges from 3 to 10 years . The net capitalized software balance of $ 7.5 and $ 7.4 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense related to the capitalized software costs was $ 2.0 , $ 1.5 and $ 1.3 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Property and Equipment A summary of property and equipment as of December 31 is as follows: 2019 2018 Land $ 0.5 $ 3.4 Buildings 10.2 12.0 Furniture, fixtures, and autos 164.8 167.3 Computer equipment 130.3 128.7 Leasehold improvements 299.7 302.2 Property and equipment $ 605.5 $ 613.6 60 Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using primarily the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings - up to 40 years ; furniture, fixtures, autos and computer equipment - 2 to 15 years ; leasehold improvements - lesser of life of asset or expected lease term . Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized whereas expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to income as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the difference between the unamortized cost and the proceeds is recorded as either a gain or a loss and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Leases We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 14 years. Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our right-of-use (“ROU”) assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. We elected the package of three practical expedients which lessened the transitional burden of implementing the new guidance. Accordingly, we did not reassess: 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; or 3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Lastly, we have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. That is, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. Derivative Financial Instruments We account for our derivative instruments in accordance with the accounting guidance on derivative instruments and hedging activities. Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of our non-United States subsidiaries have been translated in accordance with the accounting guidance on foreign currency translation. Under the accounting guidance, asset and liability accounts are translated at the current exchange rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rates each month. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in shareholders’ equity. 61 As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes is accounted for as a hedge of our net investment in our subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the amount of the related borrowings, net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ Equity The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2019, August 2018 and July 2016. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2019, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $ 203.0 under the 2018 authorization. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $ 500.7 . In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $ 203.9 under the 2016 authorization. As of December 31, 2019, there were 6.0 million and 0.8 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and 2018 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized under the 2016 authorization. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $ 2.18 , $ 2.02 and $ 1.86 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $ 129.3 , $ 127.3 and $ 123.7 , respectively. Noncontrolling interests, included in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 1.8 and $ 6.5 for 2019 and 2017, respectively, and income of $ 4.9 for 2018. The income recorded in 2018 was due to a revision in one of our joint venture agreements. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Payroll Tax Credit In January 2013, the French government passed legislation, Credit d’Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi (“CICE”), that provided payroll tax credits based on a percentage of wages paid to employees receiving less than two-and-a-half times the French minimum wage. The payroll tax credit was equal to 4 % of eligible wages in 2013, 6 % of eligible wages in 2014 to 2016, 7 % of eligible wages in 2017, and 6 % of eligible wages in 2018. The CICE payroll tax credit was accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period earned. In January 2019, the French government replaced the CICE program with a new subsidy program. The payroll tax credit was creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years . Given the amount of our current income taxes payable, we would generally receive the vast majority of these payroll tax credits after the three-year period. In April 2019, April 2018 and March 2017, we entered into agreements to sell the credits earned in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ), $ 234.5 (€ 190.9 ) and $ 143.5 (€ 133.0 ), respectively, which represented approximately half of the credits earned in 2018 and substantially all the credits earned in 2017 and 2016. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement were such that the transaction qualified for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective year. 62 Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2019 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued new accounting guidance on leases, ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which we adopted on January 1, 2019. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depend on the classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption. As of the transition date, the ROU asset and total lease liability (current and long-term) were $ 458.1 and $ 458.7 , respectively. In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on hedge accounting. The amendments in this guidance include the elimination of the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges, recognition and presentation of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, recognition and presentation of components excluded from an entity's hedge effectiveness assessment, addition of the ability to elect to perform subsequent effectiveness assessments qualitatively, and addition of new disclosure requirements. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. There was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the modified disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting comprehensive income. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""Tax Act""). The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2019. We elected not to adopt this optional reclassification. In June 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment awards. The guidance makes the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees largely consistent with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. There was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable loss has been incurred. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 63 Subsequent Events Effective January 2020, our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. We will report on the new realigned segments beginning in the first quarter of 2020. All previously reported results will be restated to conform to the new presentation. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.0 from our United States Qualified Retirement Plan in January and February 2020, respectively, as a result of our ongoing settlement. The completion of lump sum payments in February will trigger final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we will reclassify the related pension losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized losses related to the pension plans of $ 7.4 , net of tax. The amount of the total required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. We have evaluated all other events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date through our filing date and noted no other events that are subject to recognition or disclosure. (2) Revenue Recognition Revenue Service Types The following is a description of our revenue service types, including Staffing and Interim, Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting, Permanent Recruitment and Other services. Staffing and Interim Staffing and Interim services include the augmentation of clients’ workforce with our contingent employees performing services under the client’s supervision, which provides our clients with a source of flexible labor. Staffing and Interim client contracts are generally short-term in nature, and we generally enter into contracts that include only a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each hour of Staffing and Interim service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting Our Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting services include utilizing consultants and contingent employees who are generally experts in a specific field advising the client to help find strategic solutions to specific matters or achieve a particular outcome. Our services may also include managing certain processes and functions within the client’s organization. We recognize revenues over time based on (i) our clients benefiting from our services as we are providing them, (ii) our clients controlling an asset as it is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance not creating an asset with an alternative use and having an enforceable right to payment for the services we have provided to date. We generally utilize an input measure of time for the service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of these performance obligations. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Permanent Recruitment Permanent Recruitment services include providing qualified candidates to our clients to hire on a permanent basis. We recognize revenues for our Permanent Recruitment services at a point in time when we place the qualified candidate, because we have determined that control of the performance obligation has transferred to the client (i.e., service performed) as we have the right to payment for our service and the client has accepted our service of providing a qualified candidate to fill a permanent position. Revenues recognized from our Permanent Recruitment services are based upon either a fixed fee per placement or as a percentage of the candidate’s salary. 64 Our RPO services are also included in our Permanent Recruitment revenues. RPO services include the various activities of managing a client's permanent workforce, which can include candidate assessments, screening, conducting candidate interviews, providing sourcing technology, and providing our marketing and recruiting expertise. We perform these activities to fulfill the overall obligation to provide permanent workforce management services, so they are not individually distinct and, therefore, we account for them as a single performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time in months, but we do have a few contracts for which we use labor hours of management services provided as this more accurately depicts the progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of management services provided, as each month of management services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of management services as we provide them. For those contracts for which we use labor hours as the input measure, w e recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each labor hour of management services provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. We consider the RPO management services and placement services to be distinct and, therefore, separate performance obligations within our RPO contracts as (i) our clients can benefit from each service on its own, and (ii) each service is separately identifiable within the client contract. The prices as specified in our contracts will generally be broken out between management fees and placement fees, which we consider the standalone selling price of each service as they are the observable inputs which depict the prices as if they were sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. The consideration from our client contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. Other Services Other services include revenues from outplacement services, MSP services, training services and franchise fees. • Outplacement services include assisting our clients in managing their workforce transitions and their employees in managing career changes by developing additional skills and finding new employment. We recognize revenues over time as we provide the service (i.e., transfer control of the performance obligation) using the input measure of hours of service to measure progress toward completion of the performance obligation. • MSP services include overall program management of our clients’ contingent workforce and generally include various activities such as reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution, depending on each client contract. We provide these services to fulfill the overall obligation of contingent workforce management services so the individual activities are not distinct and therefore we account for them as a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of MSP services provided, as each month of MSP services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of MSP services as we provide them. • Training services include teaching skills that relate to specific competencies in order for our client’s workforce to acquire knowledge and develop skills proficiencies. We recognize revenues over time for each hour of training service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. • Our franchise fees include the performance obligation of providing the right to use our intellectual property in a specifically defined exclusive territory as defined in a franchise agreement. Our franchise agreements generally state that franchise fees are calculated based on a percentage of revenues earned by the franchise operations and are payable on a monthly basis. As such, we record franchise fee revenues monthly over time calculated based on the specific fee percentage and the monthly revenues of the franchise operations. Franchise fees were $ 18.4 , $ 24.1 and $ 23.7 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 65 Disaggregation of Revenues In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types and timing of revenue recognition and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenues by reportable segment.

Consideration received from share-based awards for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 7.0 , $ 5.2 and $ 44.2 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized related to share-based compensation during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 1.8 , $ 4.5 and $ 23.7 , respectively. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each award. Stock Options All share-based compensation is granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of ManpowerGroup Inc. (“2011 Plan”). Options and stock appreciation rights are granted at a price not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Generally, options are granted with a ratable vesting period of up to four years and expire ten years from date of grant. No stock appreciation rights had been granted or were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. A summary of stock option activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg.

The total fair value of options vested during the same periods was $ 2.3 , $ 3.1 and $ 2.3 , respectively. As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation cost was approximately $ 2.0 , net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Average risk-free interest rate 2.5 % 2.6 % 2.0 % Expected dividend yield 2.9 % 1.6 % 2.0 % Expected volatility 27.0 % 27.0 % 31.0 % Expected term (years) 6.0 6.0 6.0 The average risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (weighted 75 %) of our stock price over the past five years and implied volatility (weighted 25 %) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We believe that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than considering purely historical volatility. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option granted during the year was $ 17.78 , $ 31.46 and $ 25.58 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Deferred Stock Our non-employee directors may elect to receive deferred stock in lieu of part or all of their annual cash retainer otherwise payable to them. The number of shares of deferred stock is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the terms and conditions adopted under the 2011 Plan; the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock according to these terms and conditions. During December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were 1,275 , 5,551 and 3,647 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. Non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of deferred stock (or restricted stock, if they so elect) as additional compensation for board service. The award vests in equal quarterly installments over one year and the vested portion of the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock either upon a director’s termination of service or three years after the date of grant (which may in most cases be extended at the directors’ election) in accordance with the terms and conditions under the 2011 Plan. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were 18,172 , 10,152 and 9,857 , respectively, shares of deferred stock and 7,407 , 6,345 and 9,792 , respectively, shares of restricted stock granted under this arrangement, all of which are vested except for 1,666 shares of restricted stock granted in 2018 that were cancelled. We recognized expense of $ 1.4 , $ 1.9 and $ 1.4 related to deferred stock in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 68 Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and to non-employee directors who may elect to receive restricted stock rather than deferred stock as described above. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging up to six years , and in some cases upon retirement. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Unvested, January 1, 2017 451 $ 70 1.4 Granted 167 98 Vested ( 133 ) 79 Forfeited ( 37 ) 80 Unvested, December 31, 2017 448 $ 77 1.2 Granted 145 $ 119 Vested ( 174 ) 77 Forfeited ( 23 ) 89 Unvested, December 31, 2018 396 $ 92 1.3 Granted 236 $ 84 Vested ( 150 ) 76 Forfeited ( 36 ) 93 Unvested, December 31, 2019 446 $ 97 1.5 $ 43 During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $ 15.5 , $ 13.3 and $ 12.3 , respectively, of expense related to restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $ 16.0 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. Performance Share Units Our 2011 Plan allows us to grant performance share units. We grant performance share units typically with a performance period of three years . Vesting of units occurs at the end of the performance period or after a subsequent holding period, except in the case of termination of employment where the units are forfeited immediately. Upon retirement, a prorated number of units vest depending on the period worked from the grant date to retirement date or in certain cases all of the units vest. In the case of death or disability, the units immediately vest at the Target Award level if the death or disability date is during the performance period, or at the level determined by the performance criteria met during the performance period if the death or disability occurs during the subsequent holding period. The units are settled in shares of our common stock. A payout multiple is applied to the units awarded based on the performance criteria determined by the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. In the event the performance criteria exceeds the Target Award level, an additional number of shares, up to the Outstanding Award level, may be granted. In the event the performance criteria falls below the Target Award level, a reduced number of shares, as low as the Threshold Award level, may be granted. If the performance criteria falls below the Threshold Award level, no shares will be granted. 69 A summary of the performance share units detail by grant year is as follows: 2016 2017 2018 2019 Grant Date(s) February 16, 2016 February 9, 2017 February 15, 2018 February 15, 2019 Performance Period (years) 2016-2018 2017-2019 2018-2020 2019-2021 Vesting Date February 2019 February 2020(a) February 2021(a) February 2022(a) Payout Levels (in units): Threshold Award 65,141 57,563 47,003 68,132 Target Award 130,282 115,125 94,005 136,264 Outstanding Award 260,564 230,250 188,010 272,528 Shares Issued in 2019 125,070 — — — Payout Achieved Over Performance Period — 88,377 — — (a) 2017, 2018 and 2019 awards are scheduled to vest in February 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, when the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the achievement of the performance criteria. We recognize and adjust compensation expense based on the likelihood of the performance criteria specified in the award being achieved. The compensation expense is recognized over the performance and holding periods and is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. We have recognized total compensation expense of $ 5.2 , $ 8.4 and $ 10.8 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the performance share units. (4) Acquisitions and Dispositions Switzerland Acquisitions On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 219.5 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 161.2 was for cash and cash equivalents. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $ 415.1 , or $ 97.6 net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 80.4 , $ 32.5 represented foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest from accumulated other comprehensive income. 70 The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of April 3, 2019: Cash and cash equivalents $ 317.5 Accounts receivable 60.4 Prepaid expenses and other assets 31.4 Goodwill 33.8 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 19.6 Intangible assets not subject to amortization, reacquired franchise rights 25.5 Property and equipment 0.4 Accounts payable ( 21.6 ) Employee compensation payable ( 2.5 ) Accrued liabilities ( 9.9 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 7.5 ) Value added taxes payable ( 7.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 24.6 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 415.1 The customer relationship intangible asset will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The goodwill from the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill was $ 44.5 and $ 34.2 , respectively. Manpower Switzerland contributed revenues from services of $ 337.7 since the acquisition. Our consolidated unaudited proforma historical revenues from services, as if Manpower Switzerland had been acquired at the beginning of 2018, are estimated as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Revenues from services $ 20,957.9 $ 22,452.6 Other Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 47.7 , $ 51.8 and $ 45.7 , respectively. The 2019 balance includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 13.0 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $ 9.1 and contingent consideration payments of $ 42.7 , of which $ 18.6 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $ 32.7 and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $ 13.0 , of which $ 10.3 was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S Group GmbH (""7S"") in Germany. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2019 acquisitions, excluding Manpower Switzerland, were $ 14.2 and $ 9.0 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $ 6.1 and $ 0.7 , respectively. 71 ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited Disposition On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51 % controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25 % of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25 %, and then further diluted to 36.87 % as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $ 30.4 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the $30.4 was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $ 6.2 related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive income. Other Dispositions Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations in order to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for an after tax net gain of $ 3.8 and divested a majority interest in a fully consolidated entity in China for an immaterial gain. (5) Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Current United States Federal $ 16.7 $ 17.2 $ 211.7 State 2.5 10.8 8.4 Non-United States 243.6 181.9 168.6 Total current 262.8 209.9 388.7 Deferred United States Federal ( 22.1 ) ( 7.5 ) ( 178.2 ) State 1.1 1.0 ( 0.8 ) Non-United States ( 22.0 ) ( 5.4 ) ( 17.8 ) Total deferred ( 43.0 ) ( 11.9 ) ( 196.8 ) Total provision $ 219.8 $ 198.0 $ 191.9 72 A tax reconciliation between taxes computed at the United States federal statutory rate of 21 % for 2019 and 2018 and 35 % for 2017 and the consolidated effective tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Income tax based on statutory rate $ 143.9 $ 158.5 $ 258.1 Increase (decrease) resulting from: Non-United States tax rate difference: French business tax (1) 54.9 59.1 46.9 French CICE (2) — ( 39.9 ) ( 77.1 ) Other (1)(2) 37.3 20.0 ( 28.6 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings (2)(3) ( 17.8 ) 2.5 69.7 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.1 8.2 1.1 Change in valuation allowance 20.0 0.7 ( 6.9 ) Work Opportunity Tax Credit ( 10.4 ) ( 8.8 ) ( 10.5 ) Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction ( 11.9 ) ( 12.5 ) — United States Tax Act and French tax reform (3) — 3.2 ( 73.7 ) Goodwill impairment (4) 11.9 — — Gain related to Manpower Switzerland and Greater China transactions (5) ( 22.8 ) — — Other, net 11.6 7.0 12.9 Tax provision $ 219.8 $ 198.0 $ 191.9 (1) The French business tax is allowed as a deduction for French income tax purposes. The gross amount of the French business tax was $ 69.5 , $ 74.8 and $ 72.1 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amounts in the table above of $ 54.9 , $ 59.1 and $ 46.9 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represent the French business tax expense net of the French tax benefit using the United States federal rate of 21 % for 2019 and 2018 and 35 % for 2017. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences are a benefit of $ 9.3 and $ 10.1 for 2019 and 2018, respectively, and an expense of $ 0.4 for 2017 related to the difference between the United States federal rate and the French tax rate applied to the respective gross amounts of the French business tax. (2) The French CICE was a payroll tax credit that was tax-free for French tax purposes and increased French earnings. The amounts in the table above of $ 39.9 and $ 77.1 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, represent the French tax benefits using the United States federal rate of 21 % for 2018 and 35 % for 2017. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences are a benefit of $ 25.5 for 2018 and an expense of $ 1.3 for 2017 related to the difference between the United States federal rate and French tax rate applied to the respective gross French CICE amounts. In January 2019, the French government replaced the CICE subsidy with new subsidies that are taxable. (3) Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, we recorded $ 83.3 of tax expense in 2017 related to non-United States earnings that were deemed to be not permanently invested. This amount was included in the Repatriation of non-United States earnings consistent with prior years. As a result of the Tax Act, this $83.3 was reversed as we were no longer recording United States federal income tax expense on these earnings, and this tax benefit was included in the United States Tax Act and French tax reform benefit of $ 73.7 . (4) Non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in Germany in June 2019. (5) Non-taxable gains on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland in April 2019 and the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019. 73 Deferred income taxes are recorded based on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The Tax Act significantly impacted our deferred income taxes. Temporary differences, which give rise to the deferred taxes, are as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Future Income Tax Benefits (Expense) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance $ 12.8 $ 13.8 Employee compensation payable 27.2 17.8 Pension and postretirement benefits 62.3 46.9 Intangible assets ( 108.7 ) ( 102.1 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings ( 8.8 ) ( 15.3 ) Loans denominated in foreign currencies ( 16.4 ) ( 19.6 ) Operating lease ROU assets ( 115.8 ) — Operating lease liabilities 118.1 — Net operating losses 89.5 100.5 Other 135.0 97.4 Valuation allowance ( 87.8 ) ( 72.4 ) Total future tax benefits $ 107.4 $ 67.0 Deferred tax asset $ 126.2 $ 99.3 Deferred tax liability ( 18.8 ) ( 32.3 ) Total future tax benefits $ 107.4 $ 67.0 Pre-tax earnings of non-United States operations were $ 416.6 , $ 551.0 and $ 514.9 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on $ 371.5 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2019, deferred taxes for non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $ 1,867.0 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 8.8 and $ 15.3 , respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We had United States federal and non-United States net operating loss carryforwards and United States state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 399.4 and $ 169.2 , respectively, as of December 31, 2019. The net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: United States Federal and Non-United States United States State 2020 $ 2.1 $ 0.2 2021 5.3 3.0 2022 3.8 11.1 2023 3.9 9.8 2024 5.7 57.3 Thereafter 25.2 87.8 No expirations 353.4 — Total net operating loss carryforwards $ 399.4 $ 169.2 We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $ 89.5 as of December 31, 2019, for the benefit of these net operating losses. Realization of this asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards. A related valuation allowance of $ 72.7 was recorded as of December 31, 2019, as management believed that realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is unlikely. 74 As of December 31, 2019 , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 69.5 that would favorably affect the effective tax rate if recognized. During 2019, we filed our 2018 United States federal tax return with a position related to the transition tax imposed as part of the Tax Act, resulting in an increase to our unrecognized tax benefits of $ 32.0 with minimal impact to the tax provision. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next year. As of December 31, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 34.2 . We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. In 2019, we accrued net interest and penalties of $ 1.6 . In 2018, we recognized a reduction of interest and penalties due to the settlement of tax litigation of $ 18.4 . We accrued net interest and penalties of $ 0.2 in 2017. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2019, 2018 and 2017: 2019 2018 2017 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 32.2 $ 46.1 $ 23.8 Increases in prior year tax positions 35.7 11.4 27.1 Decreases in prior year tax positions ( 2.6 ) ( 1.8 ) ( 1.2 ) Increases for current year tax positions 4.7 5.9 6.6 Expiration of statute of limitations and audit settlements ( 4.1 ) ( 29.4 ) ( 10.2 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 65.9 $ 32.2 $ 46.1 Potential interest and penalties 3.6 2.0 20.4 Balance, end of year $ 69.5 $ 34.2 $ 66.5 We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2012 through 2019 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2019, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Israel, and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (6) Net Earnings Per Share The calculation of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Net earnings available to common shareholders: $ 465.7 $ 556.7 $ 545.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions): Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 59.9 64.6 67.1 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.1 0.2 Effect of other share-based awards 0.4 0.4 0.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 60.3 65.1 67.9 Net earnings per share - basic $ 7.78 $ 8.62 $ 8.13 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 7.72 $ 8.56 $ 8.04 There were certain share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, because their impact was anti-dilutive. No share-based awards were excluded from the calculation for the year ended December 31, 2017. The number, exercise prices and weighted-average remaining life of these antidilutive awards were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Shares (in thousands) 401 264 — Exercise price $ 99 $ 109 $ — Weighted-average remaining life 0.9 years 1.2 years — 75 (7) Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate (3) Total (4) Balance, January 1, 2018 $ 519.2 $ 121.9 $ 468.1 $ 106.2 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,343.0 Goodwill acquired 4.6 — — 1.5 — — 6.1 Goodwill allocated to business units sold — — ( 8.8 ) — — — ( 8.8 ) Currency impact and other ( 3.9 ) ( 9.7 ) ( 23.9 ) ( 5.7 ) — — ( 43.2 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 519.9 112.2 435.4 102.0 62.1 65.5 1,297.1 Goodwill acquired 14.2 33.8 — — — — 48.0 Goodwill allocated to business units deconsolidated (5) — — — ( 18.5 ) — ( 1.6 ) ( 20.1 ) Impairment charge (6) — — ( 60.2 ) ( 3.8 ) — — ( 64.0 ) Currency impact and other 1.5 ( 1.2 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 0.6 ) — — ( 0.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 535.6 $ 144.8 $ 374.6 $ 79.1 $ 62.1 $ 63.9 $ 1,260.1 (1) Balances related to United States were $ 476.5 as of January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and $ 490.3 as of December 31, 2019. (2) Balances related to France were $ 76.3 , $ 68.9 and $ 67.3 as of January 1, 2018, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 5.0 , $ 4.8 and $ 4.6 as of January 1, 2018, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance as of December 31, 2019 relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisition of Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ) which is part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See the table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. (4) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 513.4 ($ 235.2 related to Right Management and $ 278.2 related to Corporate) as of January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and $ 577.4 ($ 60.2 related to Northern Europe, $ 3.8 related to APME, $ 235.2 related to Right Management and $ 278.2 related to Corporate) as of December 31, 2019. (5) Reductions relate to our China and Hong Kong reporting units, which were deconsolidated as of July 10, 2019. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (6) The impairment charges of $ 60.2 and $ 3.8 relate to our Germany and New Zealand reporting units, respectively, which were recorded during the second quarter of 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: December 31 2019 2018 United States $ 545.8 $ 532.0 Netherlands 109.5 112.0 United Kingdom 97.3 93.7 France 67.3 68.9 Germany 67.2 129.2 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Other reporting units 310.9 299.2 Total goodwill $ 1,260.1 $ 1,297.1 76 (8) Debt Information concerning short-term borrowings is as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Short-term borrowings $ 61.0 $ 49.9 Weighted-average interest rates 7.7 % 8.4 % We maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2019, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $ 324.1 , of which $ 253.6 was unused. Under our revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $ 300.0 in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $ 600.0 in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $ 229.5 could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2019. A summary of long-term debt is as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Euro-denominated notes: € 500.0 due June 2026 $ 555.8 $ 567.8 € 400.0 due September 2022 447.1 456.8 Other 9.5 0.9 1,012.4 1,025.5 Less current maturities — 0.2 Long-term debt $ 1,012.4 $ 1,025.3 Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold € 500.0 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750 % notes due June 2026 (the “ € 500.0 notes”). The net proceeds from t he €500.0 notes of € 495.7 were used to repay our € 350.0 notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 notes were issued at a price of 99.564 % to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809 %. Interest on the €500.0 notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our € 400.0 aggregate principal amount 1.875 % notes (the "" €400.0 notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $ 600.0 r evolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 notes or the €400.0 notes. Both the € 500.0 notes and € 400.0 notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. These notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2019. Since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) 77 Revolving Credit Agreement We have a Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of June 18, 2023 . The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $ 600.0 in various currencies, and up to $ 150.0 may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 0.5 as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Additional borrowings of $ 599.5 were available to us under the facility as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. Debt Maturities The maturities of long-term debt payable within each of the four years subsequent to December 31, 2020 are as follows: 2021 - $ 0.1 , 2022 - $ 454.5 , 2023 - $ 2.0 , 2024 - $ 0.0 . (9) Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans For all of our United States defined benefit and retiree health care plans, we adopted the Society of Actuaries’ Pri-2012 Mortality Table with MP-2019 Mortality Improvement Scale in determining the plans’ benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019. 78 Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. In 2019, a new pension plan was added as a result of our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) The reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans are as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 48.9 $ 53.7 $ 450.0 $ 489.5 Service cost — — 15.1 10.9 Interest cost 1.8 1.6 10.9 10.0 Acquisitions — — 201.2 — Settlements — — ( 40.9 ) — Transfers — — 52.7 1.2 Actuarial loss (gain) 6.3 ( 2.0 ) 100.1 ( 28.0 ) Plan participant contributions — — 9.0 0.2 Benefits paid ( 4.2 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 11.3 ) ( 10.5 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — 8.0 ( 23.3 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 52.8 $ 48.9 $ 794.8 $ 450.0 United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 36.1 $ 38.7 $ 354.1 $ 376.7 Actual return on plan assets 4.4 ( 0.7 ) 69.5 ( 2.4 ) Acquisitions — — 196.8 — Settlements — — ( 40.9 ) — Transfers — — 51.6 ( 0.3 ) Plan participant contributions — — 9.0 0.2 Company contributions 2.5 2.5 15.4 9.2 Benefits paid ( 4.2 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 11.3 ) ( 10.5 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — 11.2 ( 18.8 ) Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 38.8 $ 36.1 $ 655.4 $ 354.1 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 14.0 ) $ ( 12.8 ) $ ( 139.4 ) $ ( 95.9 ) Amounts Recognized Noncurrent assets $ 15.0 $ 15.0 $ 41.4 $ 46.9 Current liabilities ( 2.5 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 0.5 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 26.5 ) ( 25.3 ) ( 180.1 ) ( 142.3 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 14.0 ) $ ( 12.8 ) $ ( 139.4 ) $ ( 95.9 ) 79 Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consisted of: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net loss $ 15.8 $ 13.7 $ 50.5 $ 16.5 Prior service cost — — 7.8 7.7 Total $ 15.8 $ 13.7 $ 58.3 $ 24.2 The accumulated benefit obligation for our plans that have plan assets was $ 717.2 and $ 390.4 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 163.8 $ 129.4 Plan assets 80.4 67.0 The projected benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Projected benefit obligation $ 414.6 $ 135.8 Plan assets 324.3 67.0 The Swiss plan that we acquired during 2019 was underfunded, resulting in the significant increase in the amounts above. By their nature, certain of our plans do not have plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for these plans was $ 100.4 and $ 86.0 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The components of the net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for all plans were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost $ 15.1 $ 10.9 $ 10.1 Interest cost 12.7 11.6 10.6 Expected return on assets ( 12.9 ) ( 10.6 ) ( 10.8 ) Settlements 0.4 — — Net loss 1.2 1.4 0.9 Prior service cost 0.7 0.6 0.4 Net periodic benefit cost 17.2 13.9 11.2 Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligation Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net loss (gain) 45.5 ( 16.6 ) ( 1.5 ) Prior service cost 1.0 1.4 2.9 Amortization of net loss ( 1.6 ) ( 1.4 ) ( 0.9 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 0.7 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 0.4 ) Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss 44.2 ( 17.2 ) 0.1 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ 61.4 $ ( 3.3 ) $ 11.3 80 The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 20 20 are $ 3.1 and $ 0.7 , respectively. The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the benefit obligation were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Discount rate 2.5 % 4.2 % 1.1 % 2.4 % Rate of compensation increase 3.0 % 3.0 % 1.7 % 1.8 % The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Discount rate - service cost 4.2 % 3.6 % 4.1 % 1.8 % 2.1 % 2.2 % Discount rate - interest cost 4.2 % 3.2 % 3.3 % 1.8 % 2.1 % 2.2 % Expected long-term return on plan assets 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.8 % Rate of compensation increase 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 1.7 % 1.8 % 1.7 % We determine our assumption for the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. Our overall expected long-term rate of return used in the measurement of the 2019 net periodic benefit cost on United States plan assets was 4.3 %, while the rates of return on our non-United States plans varied by country and ranged from 1.4 % to 3.5 %. For a majority of our plans, a building block approach has been employed to establish this return. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income instruments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. We also use guaranteed insurance contracts for four of our foreign plans. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected rate of return. Projected salary levels utilized in the determination of the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans are based upon historical experience and the future expectations for each respective country. Our plans’ investment policies are to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Our long-term objective is to minimize plan expenses and contributions by outperforming plan liabilities. We have historically used a balanced portfolio strategy based primarily on a target allocation of equity securities and fixed-income instruments, which vary by location. These target allocations, which are similar to the 2019 allocations, are determined based on the favorable risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted within a specified range to advance our overall objective. The fair values of our Level 1 and Leve 2 pension plan assets are primarily determined by using market quotes and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Insurance contracts and annuity contracts are measured at the present value of expected future benefit payments primarily using associated interest curves. Hedge funds consist of a number of diversified funds including those investing in international securities, equity and private partnership interests valued using market available data and various models and assumptions. 81 The fair value of our pension plan assets by asset category was as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents (1) $ 5.8 $ — $ 5.8 $ — $ 5.5 $ 5.5 $ — $ — Equity securities: Mutual funds 7.8 7.8 — — 98.0 98.0 — — Common stock — — — — 22.3 22.3 — — Fixed income instruments: Fixed income funds 25.2 — 25.2 — 160.0 — 160.0 — Annuity contract — — — — 52.5 — — 52.5 Bonds — — — — 37.0 — 37.0 — Guaranteed insurance contracts — — — — 18.5 — 18.5 — Other types of investments: Insurance contracts — — — — 130.6 — — 130.6 Real estate funds — — — — 93.3 — 87.3 6.0 Hedge funds — — — — 29.3 — 9.6 19.7 Other — — — — 8.4 — 2.4 6.0 $ 38.8 $ 7.8 $ 31.0 $ — $ 655.4 $ 125.8 $ 314.8 $ 214.8 (1) This category includes a prime obligations money market portfolio. 82 United States Plans Non-United States Plans Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents (1) $ 5.1 $ — $ 5.1 $ — $ 35.5 $ 35.5 $ — $ — Equity securities: Mutual funds 6.3 6.3 — — 30.5 30.5 — — Fixed income instruments: Fixed income funds 24.7 — 24.7 — 99.4 — 99.4 — Annuity contract — — — — 46.2 — — 46.2 Guaranteed insurance contracts — — — — 17.7 — 17.7 — Bank loans — — — — 8.9 — 8.9 — Other types of investments: Insurance contracts — — — — 107.7 — — 107.7 Real estate funds — — — — 8.2 — 8.2 — $ 36.1 $ 6.3 $ 29.8 $ — $ 354.1 $ 66.0 $ 134.2 $ 153.9 (1) This category includes a prime obligations money market portfolio. Certain asset categories in the prior year have been reclassified in order to consolidate for presentation purposes and to conform to current year presentation. The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the pension assets that are measured using Level 3 inputs. We determined that transfers between fair-value-measurement levels occurred on the date of the event that caused the transfer. Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 Balance, beginning of year $ 153.9 $ 108.8 Actual return on plan assets 30.5 4.2 Acquisitions 27.6 — Transfers — 46.2 Purchases, sales and settlements, net 2.5 ( 0.3 ) Currency exchange rate changes 0.3 ( 5.0 ) Balance, end of year $ 214.8 $ 153.9 83 Retiree Health Care Plan We provide medical and dental benefits to certain eligible retired employees in the United States. Due to the nature of the plan, there are no plan assets. The reconciliation of the changes in the plan’s benefit obligation and the statement of the funded status of the plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 13.7 $ 14.9 Interest cost 0.5 0.5 Actuarial loss (gain) 0.8 ( 0.5 ) Benefits paid ( 0.9 ) ( 1.2 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 14.1 $ 13.7 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year $ ( 14.1 ) $ ( 13.7 ) Amounts Recognized Current liabilities $ ( 1.1 ) $ ( 1.1 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 13.0 ) ( 12.6 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 14.1 ) $ ( 13.7 ) The amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consists of a net loss of $ 1.5 and $ 0.9 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a prior service credit of $ 3.5 and $ 4.1 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of the benefit obligation was 3.0 % and 4.2 % in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of net periodic benefit cost was 4.2 %, 3.2 % and 4.0 % in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for this plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Net Periodic Benefit Credit Interest cost $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 0.6 Net loss — 0.1 0.1 Prior service credit ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) Net periodic benefit credit $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.2 ) $ ( 0.1 ) Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net loss (gain) $ 0.8 $ ( 0.5 ) $ ( 0.3 ) Amortization of net loss — ( 0.1 ) ( 0.1 ) Amortization of prior service credit 0.8 0.8 0.8 Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss 1.6 0.2 0.4 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $ 1.3 $ — $ 0.3 The estimated net loss and prior service credit for the retiree health care plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2020 are $ 0.1 and $ 0.8 , respectively. The health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 6.8 % for 2020, decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5 % in 2027. Assumed health care cost trend rates are not expected to have a material effect on the amounts reported. 84 Future Contributions and Payments During 2020, we plan to contribute approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Projected benefit payments from the plans as of December 31, 2019 were estimated as follows: Year Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2020 $ 86.0 $ 1.1 2021 35.3 1.1 2022 25.6 1.1 2023 23.2 1.1 2024 25.3 1.0 2025–2029 142.0 4.7 Total projected benefit payments $ 337.4 $ 10.1 Defined Contribution Plans and Deferred Compensation Plans We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all permanent United States employees and various other employees throughout the world. With our company-sponsored plans, employees may elect to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans and we match a portion of their contributions up to a maximum percentage of the employee’s salary. In addition, profit sharing contributions are made if a targeted earnings level is reached at management’s discretion. The total expense for our match and any profit sharing contributions was $ 16.9 , $ 17.7 and $ 17.6 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In certain countries with statutory defined contribution plans, we pay a percentage of the employees' salary in pension premiums. The total expense for the statutory defined contribution plans was $ 32.1 , $ 37.4 and $ 35.6 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also have deferred compensation plans in the United States. One of the plans had an asset and liability of $ 106.2 and $ 88.5 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the remaining plans holding immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities. (10) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Foreign currency translation $ ( 260.5 ) $ ( 223.2 ) Translation gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of income taxes of $( 9.1 ) and $( 12.9 ), respectively 13.1 ( 4.7 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 121.5 ) ( 137.2 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $( 30.9 ) and $( 23.2 ), respectively ( 74.1 ) ( 37.9 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.6 and $ 2.0 , respectively 2.0 3.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 441.0 ) $ ( 399.8 ) (11) Interest and Other (Income) Expenses, Net Interest and other (income) expenses, net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Interest expense $ 44.4 $ 47.0 $ 49.4 Interest income ( 6.0 ) ( 6.0 ) ( 4.8 ) Foreign exchange loss 6.7 1.4 0.8 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 85.7 ) ( 0.4 ) 6.5 Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ ( 40.6 ) $ 42.0 $ 51.9 (1) Includes an $ 80.4 gain related to our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 85 (12) Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ( $ 447.1 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 555.8 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2019. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The hedging relationship is expected to be perfectly effective, as the critical terms of the swap match the designated hedge. Effectiveness will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively every reporting period by confirming these conditions continue to be met. If they are no longer met at any time during the relationship, the hypothetical derivative method will be used to assess hedge effectiveness. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 2018 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Reclassified Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Year Ended December 31, from AOCI into Income Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2019 2018 2019 2018 Euro Notes $ 22.9 $ 45.4 Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ — $ — Cross-currency swaps ( 9.0 ) — Interest and other (income) expenses, net 8.7 — Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 86 In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019 , we entered into to a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We apply the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on OCI, AOCI and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 2018: Gain Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income Year Ended December 31, Location of Gain Reclassified Year Ended December 31, Instrument 2019 2018 from AOCI into Income 2019 2018 Cross-currency swaps $ 7.3 $ — Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ 8.3 $ — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains and losses included in AOCI at December 31, 2019 to be reclassified into earnings to approximate $ 10.0 over the next twelve months. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-Designated Instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ 11.9 $ — 87 Derivative and Non-Derivative Assets and Liabilities The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019, and 2018: Assets December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 9.7 $ — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net — 0.1 Total instruments $ 9.7 $ 0.1 Liabilities December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,002.9 $ 1,024.6 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 6.0 — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities — 0.1 Total instruments $ 1,008.9 $ 1,024.7 The fair value measurements of these items recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (13) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 153.5 Short-term lease expense 17.6 Other lease expense (1) 15.8 Total lease expense $ 186.9 (1) Other lease expense includes variable lease expense and sublease income.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. We develop and implement global workforce solutions for our clients that deliver the outcomes that help them achieve their business strategy. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; APME; and Right Management. 89 The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from the placement of contingent workers. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from other workforce solutions and services, including ManpowerGroup Solutions (RPO, MSP, Proservia and Talent Based Outsourcing (TBO)), recruitment and assessment, and training and development. The Right Management segment revenues are derived from career management and talent management services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on operating unit profit, which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. Total assets for the segments are reported after the elimination of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany accounts.

We record accruals for loss contingencies based on the circumstances of each claim, when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition. 93 On April 26, 2017, the sellers of 7S, a company we acquired in 2015, formally disputed the contingent consideration related to the acquisition, claiming an additional $ 23.7 (€ 20.8 ), plus interest. The dispute was submitted to an arbitration tribunal in Germany. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration forum handed down its decision, rejecting the claims brought by the 7S sellers. Finding in favor of ManpowerGroup, the arbitration tribunal confirmed that no further amounts are owed by us, and also awarded us reimbursement of legal fees and other costs. Guarantees We have entered into certain guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $ 845.0 as of December 31, 2019 ($ 793.4 for guarantees and $ 51.6 for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements .

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 95 Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During 2019, we implemented internal controls to ensure we have adequately evaluated our lease portfolio and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to leases on our financial statements to support the adoption on January 1, 2019. We did not have any significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard. Item 9B. Other Information Not applicable. 96 PART III Item 10.

We are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Operations Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, as we experienced in the first half of 2018 , we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. When demand drops, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline at the same pace as revenues. In periods of economic contraction, we may have more significant expense deleveraging, as we believe it is prudent not to reduce selling and administrative expenses to levels that could negatively impact the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. 4 The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with an average days sales outstanding of between 50 and 60 days based on the markets where we do business. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable are outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Due to our industry’s sensitivity to economic factors, the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short-term nature of staffing assignments, it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with certainty. As a result, we monitor a number of economic indicators, as well as recent business trends, to predict future revenue trends for each of the countries and territories where we operate. Based upon these anticipated trends, we determine what level of personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities. During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have helped drive demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the global economy continues to grow and adapt with new technology, we are helping clients manage their workforce transformation and ensure they have the right skills now and in the future. Whether it is through workforce assessments, targeted training or by creating longer-term development paths, we help organizations and candidates future-proof their skills. Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and industrial positions. All of these services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for 70 years with a primary focus on the areas of office and industrial services and solutions. We provide services under our Experis brand, particularly in the areas of IT, Engineering, and Finance, that include high-impact solutions, and accelerate organizations’ growth by attracting, assessing and placing specialized expertise to deliver in-demand talent for mission-critical positions. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates’ workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise or continue. ManpowerGroup Solutions specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and outcome-based solutions. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through exclusive outsourcing contracts. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative functions. TBO and Proservia services also include management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities. Our career management services are counter-cyclical to our staffing services, which helps to offset the impact of an economic downturn on our overall financial results. Americas We provide services as Manpower, Experis and ManpowerGroup Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The Americas segment had 573 branch and 182 franchise offices. In the United States, where we realized 61% of the Americas’ revenue, we had 377 branch and 167 franchise offices as of December 31, 2018 , as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico and Argentina, we had 196 branch offices and 15 franchise offices. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise. 5 Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower® service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchisee sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise with appropriate prices and terms. Our Manpower and Experis operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. During 2018 in this segment, approximately 38% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 23% from placing office staff, and 39% from placing professional and technical staff. For our United States operations in 2018 , approximately 48% of the temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 13% from placing office staff, and 39% from placing professional and technical staff. Our ManpowerGroup Solutions operations provide a variety of outcome-based solutions including RPO, MSP and TBO. We also conduct business in the Americas under our Right Management brand as discussed below. Southern Europe We are a leading provider of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing services throughout Europe. The Southern Europe segment had 1,103 branch offices and 49 franchise offices as of December 31, 2018 . Our largest operations in this segment are in France ( 62% of the segment revenue) and Italy ( 18% of the segment revenue). The franchise offices are in Switzerland, where we own 49% of the franchise. During 2018 for our Southern Europe operations, approximately 73% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 14% from placing office staff, and 13% from placing professional and technical staff. We conduct our operations in France and the surrounding region as a leading workforce solutions and service provider through 530 branch offices as Manpower, Experis, ManpowerGroup Solutions and Proservia, and 146 branch offices under the name Supplay. The employment services market in France calls for a wide range of our services including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. The temporary recruitment market is predominantly focused on recruitment for industrial positions. In 2018 , we derived approximately 83% of our temporary recruitment revenues in France from the supply of industrial and construction workers, 16% from the supply of office staff, and 1% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In Italy, we are a leading workforce solutions and services provider. As of December 31, 2018 , ManpowerGroup Italy conducted operations through a network of 229 branch offices. It provides a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis or ManpowerGroup Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. In 2018 , approximately 69% of our temporary and contract recruitment revenues in Italy were derived from placing industrial staff, 5% from placing office staff, including contact center staff, and 26% from placing professional and technical staff. We also conduct business in Southern Europe under our Right Management brand as discussed below. Northern Europe Our largest operations in Northern Europe are in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics and the Netherlands, providing a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services through Manpower, Experis, and ManpowerGroup Solutions. Collectively, we operate through 449 branch offices in this region. During 2018 for our Northern Europe operations, approximately 41% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 24% from placing office staff, and 35% from placing professional and technical staff. 6 In the United Kingdom, where we have the largest operation in this segment, we are a leading provider of workforce solutions and services. As of December 31, 2018 , we conducted operations in the United Kingdom as Manpower, Experis and ManpowerGroup Solutions through a network of 33 branch offices and also provided on-site services to clients who have significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. During 2018 , approximately 23% of our United Kingdom operation’s temporary recruitment revenues were derived from the supply of industrial staff, 25% from the supply of office staff, and 52% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, we also conduct operations as Brook Street Bureau PLC, or Brook Street, through a total of 34 branch offices. Its core business is secretarial, office and light industrial recruitment. Brook Street operates as a local network of branches and competes primarily with local or regional independents. Brook Street’s revenues are comprised of temporary and contract placements as well as permanent recruitment. We also conduct business in Northern Europe under our Right Management brand as discussed below. APME We operate through 175 branch offices in the Asia Pacific Middle East (APME) region. The largest of these operations are located in Japan, Australia, India, Greater China and Korea, all of which operate through branch offices. Our APME operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis and ManpowerGroup Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. During 2018 , approximately 12% of our APME temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 52% from placing office staff, and 36% from placing professional and technical staff.

We design and deliver solutions to align talent strategy with business strategy. Our expertise spans Talent Assessment, Leader Development, Organizational Effectiveness, Employee Engagement, and Workforce Transition and Outplacement. With 68 offices in 51 countries and territories, we partner with companies of all sizes to help grow and engage their talent, increase productivity and optimize business performance. Competition We compete in the employment services industry by offering a broad range of services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, project-based workforce solutions, assessment and selection, training, career and talent management, managed service solutions, outsourcing, consulting and professional services. Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of United States dollars in annual revenues. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. In addition to us, the largest publicly owned companies specializing in recruitment services are The Adecco Group and Randstad. We also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies such as Recruit Holdings, Kelly Services, Robert Half, Kforce, PageGroup, Korn/Ferry International and Alexander Mann. It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the increasing demand for skilled people, employers’ desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including one of the employment services industry’s most recognized and respected brands; geographic diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and high-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, and large national and multinational client relationships, which comprised approximately 58% of our revenues in 2018 . Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses are based on a local or regional relationship, and tend to rely less on longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. The large national and multinational clients, on the other hand, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to local managers. As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed. 7 Legal Regulations The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: • regulation of the employer/employee relationship between the firm and its temporary and contract employees; • registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements; and • substantive limitations on the operations or the use of temporary and contract employees by clients. In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us. In most countries, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, health and other benefits, anti-discrimination and workers’ compensation, govern the firm. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement. In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination. Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subject to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission’s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises. Changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which workforce solutions and services firms may operate. These changes could impose additional costs, taxes, record keeping or reporting requirements; restrict the tasks to which contingent workers may be assigned; limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the relationship (with us or the client); or otherwise adversely affect the industry. Our results in France are affected by complementary health insurance costs, the Crédit d’Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi (""CICE""), and changes in social charges. In France, the government passed CICE legislation effective January 1, 2013 to improve the competitiveness and reduce employment costs by offering payroll tax credits to most French and foreign enterprises subject to corporate tax in France. This law provides credits based on a percentage of wages paid to employees receiving less than two-and-a-half times the French minimum wage. The payroll tax credit was equal to 6% in 2018. We have used, and intend to use, the credit to invest in employment opportunities and to improve our competitiveness, as required by the law. The CICE credit is accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period earned, and has had a favorable impact on our consolidated gross profit margin, as well as margins in France and Southern Europe. 8 In December 2018, the French government published their final budget for 2019, which replaced the CICE program with new subsidies in January 2019. This transition leads to a profit-sharing cost that will reduce the gross profit margin benefit of the subsidies. Based on the final budget, we estimate a reduction of our gross profit margin in France of approximately 50 basis points (-0.50%) in the first three quarters of 2019, and beginning in the fourth quarter after incremental subsidies are scheduled, we estimate the reduction will then represent approximately 15 basis points (-0.15%) going forward. We would seek to offset this net negative impact in 2019 with ongoing initiatives. In Germany, the Confederation of German Trade Unions (representing eight German trade unions and over six million people) and the Employer’s Association of the Temporary Staffing Industry (representing two major temporary worker employers’ associations) entered into a Collective Labor Agreement (“CLA”), which was implemented in multiple phases between 2014 and 2017. The first phases of the CLA required higher wages to temporary employees and higher cost for vacation, sick pay, and temporary staff time accounts. The following phase went into effect in June 2016 with a 2.3% to 3.6% wage increase. A new CLA in 2017 required three additional wage increases through 2019, with wage increases of 2.5% to 4.8% in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and that required the wage differences between the East and West be eliminated by 2021. There is also a mandate that was effective in January 2018 of equal pay for our associates after nine months on assignment. This new regulation generally had an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in Germany, as we often cannot pass on the additional costs to the client or, if so, without a mark-up. In October 2018, the 18-month rule took effect, which limited the maximum period of associate assignments to 18 months, after which such associates will be classified as employees for their assignment and allowed clients to in-source our staff. There are initiatives in place to manage any potential impact. Trademarks We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries and territories. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup ® , ManpowerGroup ® Solutions, Manpower ® , Experis ® , Right Management ® , Brook Street ® , and Proservia ® have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. Employees We had approximately 30,000 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2018 . In addition, we recruit millions of permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year on behalf of our clients. As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees. 9 Item 1A. Risk Factors FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. This section provides you with cautionary statements identifying, for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. You can identify these forward-looking statements by forward-looking words such as “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “may”, “will”, “believe”, “seek”, “estimate”, and similar expressions. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We caution that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Some or all of these factors may be beyond our control. We caution you that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions. Our business is affected by global macroeconomic conditions, which at various times have included considerable uncertainty and volatility. In particular, we have experienced periods during which economic conditions have been unstable and difficult to predict globally, and during which many regions experienced volatile growth patterns or declines. In the latter part of 2018, global economic conditions slowed down, particularly in Europe, and were marked by greater volatility and uncertainty, and in some countries, such as France and Germany, declining business sentiment. This adversely affected client demand for our services and solutions, and resulted in declines or declining growth rates in many of our markets. There is a risk if these trends continue or intensify, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. When demand drops or remains low, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, such as we experienced in some of our markets in the second half of 2018, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, during periods of decline or uncertainty, companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer. Economic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, changes in immigration policy, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. We are particularly susceptible to changes in economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and approximately 67% of our revenue. During 2018 , various economies in Europe experienced a slowdown, and there is a risk that some or many of the European economies may be hampered by events which 11 emerged in recent years, including the uncertainty around the terms under which United Kingdom will exit the European Union in March 2019. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated. Even without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. This situation can be exacerbated by uncertain and volatile economic conditions, which may cause clients to reduce or defer projects for which they utilize our services, thereby negatively affecting demand for them. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities. We may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients. There is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our clients, which may change rapidly as their businesses evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 30,000 employees based out of nearly 2,600 offices in 80 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources and provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at meeting the needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability. The worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. We may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives. Our business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. These workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client’s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner 12 that properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions. Our business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve, and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We could incur liabilities or our reputation could be damaged from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate, candidate or client data, including personal data. In connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics. In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy social engineering attacks, viruses, ransomware, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks. An incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personally identifiable and confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. It is possible that our and our third party vendors’ preventative security controls and practices may not thwart unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personally identifiable and confidential data, or fraudulent activity. 13 The potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the opportunity for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and security is subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, in 2018, European regulators began conducting audits and investigations and imposing fines on entities subject to the GDPR, which carries a potential maximum fine of up to 4% of a company’s global revenues. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, storage, processing, disclosure, transfer, destruction or security of personally identifiable data or other privacy and security related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, or any failure to mitigate other cyberattacks or material vulnerabilities, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. The increasing discovery and/or disclosure of material vulnerabilities in various systems and components, along with the uncertainty concerning patches to those material vulnerabilities and the emergence of malware and tools to exploit those material vulnerabilities, may also have a detrimental effect on our cybersecurity posture and the ability to thwart a cyberattack. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach. We have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption and increased costs. We have outsourced important aspects of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs and potential disruptions to our business operations. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide certain back office support. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk that our vendors will be unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Additionally, we replace these vendors from time to time, and there is a risk that we might suffer interruptions in service or data loss as we transition from one vendor to another. Our operations depend significantly upon these vendors’ and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third party vendors’ implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations. If the cost of our outsourced services is more than expected, if we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, in a deficiency of our internal operations or controls, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, or if our ability to deliver our services is interrupted, then our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results. During 2018 , approximately 88% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $1,075.4 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 was denominated in foreign currencies, including $1,024.6 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported 14 results and shareholders’ equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult. We seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018, to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective. A loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients, which comprised approximately 58% of our revenues in 2018 , will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business. Uncertain economic conditions may adversely impact our liquidity Our working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a focus on Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer. Our performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments. Our contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our clients' delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability. If we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer. Our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations. Intense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients’ staffing needs. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. In many markets, we have been experiencing an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable 15 to meet our clients' requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Our global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control. With operations in 80 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results. Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding enforcement of immigration laws, and there is a risk that we will incur greater expense in connection with immigration law compliance. The countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: • create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide; • require new or additional benefits be paid to our associates; • require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or • increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes. Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients. Failure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business. We are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business. 16 We may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs from clients or third parties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities include: • claims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients; • claims by our associates of wrongful termination or retaliation; • claims arising out of the actions or inactions of our associates, including matters for which we may have indemnified a client; • claims arising from violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; • claims related to classification of workers as employees or independent contractors; • claims related to the employment of undocumented or illegal workers; • payment of workers’ compensation claims and other similar claims; • violations of employee pay and benefits requirements such as violations of wage and hour requirements; • entitlement to employee benefits, including healthcare coverage; • errors and omissions of our associates and other individuals working on our behalf in performing their jobs, such as accountants, IT professionals, engineers and other technical workers; and • claims by our clients relating to our associates’ misuse of clients’ proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims. We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business. In the past several years, we devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based “wage and hour” claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we cannot be certain we will not experience similar claims in the future. We cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our business exposes us to competition law risk. We are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate, and there is a risk that we will be subject to regulatory investigation by relevant authorities. For example, in 2009, we were fined by the French Competition Council following a 2004 investigation. As previously reported, in 2013, the French Competition Authority commenced another investigation covering ManpowerGroup and a number of our competitors in France. In February 2019, the French Competition Authority announced that they have closed the investigation. There continues to be a risk, in France and in the other countries where we operate, of inquiries by competition law regulators into how we operate our business. There is no assurance we will successfully defend against such regulatory inquiries, and they may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these matters and any future matters could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. We believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute 17 to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services. From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs. From time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets or enter into operating joint ventures. These activities involve significant risks, including: • difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, financial reporting, services and corporate culture of acquired companies; • failure of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form, to meet performance expectations, which could trigger payment obligations; • over-valuation by us of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form; • disputes that arise with sellers; • failure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies as well as regulatory requirements; • insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions; and • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. 18 These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. In addition, future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, or restructuring charges could also occur. We have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Our debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $1,075.4 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following: • we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, significant acquisition opportunities, or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing; • borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and • we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions. Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. The lenders under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected or our interest expense may increase substantially. Furthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected. 19 The performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries. Since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances. Our inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries. In a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business. In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. These audits may result in additional tax liabilities. Any increase in our income tax provision and other tax provision may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors. The market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2018 , the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $136.02 to a low of $62.59 . Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these “Risk Factors” and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: • changes in general economic conditions; and • actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; • announcement of new services by us or our competitors; • announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; • changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and • changes in investor sentiment regarding the company arising from these or other events, or the economy in general. 20 Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult. Certain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include: • permitting removal of directors only for cause; • providing that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and • requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees. In addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin’s “fair price” and “business combination” provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties We own properties at various locations worldwide, none of which are material. Most of our operations are conducted from leased premises and we do not anticipate any difficulty in renewing these leases or in finding alternative sites in the ordinary course of business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are involved in litigation of a routine nature and various legal matters, which are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 21 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF MANPOWERGROUP (as of February 20, 2019 ) Name of Officer Office Jonas Prising Age 54 Chairman of ManpowerGroup as of December 31, 2015.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Common Stock Listing and Trading The Company's common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MAN. Shareholders of Record As of February 20, 2019 , the Company's common stock was held by approximately 2,900 record holders. Dividend Policy While we currently expect that future semi-annual dividends will continue to be paid, our dividend policy is subject to review and change at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may depend upon, among other factors, earnings, financial condition, and other requirements. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In August 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock. We conduct share repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. As of December 31, 2018 , there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under this authorization. The following table shows the total amount of shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2018 . Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plan or programs Maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan or programs October 1 - 31, 2018 946,376 $ 77.56 946,376 4,769,198 November 1 - 30, 2018 1,621,209 (1) 78.99 1,620,405 3,148,793 December 1 - 31, 2018 — — — 3,148,793 Total 2,567,585 $ 78.47 2,566,781 3,148,793 (1) Includes 804 shares of common stock withheld by ManpowerGroup to satisfy tax withholding obligations on shares acquired by certain officers in settlement of restricted stock. 24 Performance Graph Set forth below is a graph for the periods ending December 31, 2013-2018 comparing the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 400 Midcap Stock Index and the Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Human Resources and Employment Services Index. We are included in the Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Human Resources and Employment Services Index and we estimate that we constituted approximately 17% of the total market capitalization of the companies included in the index. The graph assumes a $100 investment on December 31, 2013 in our common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 400 Midcap Stock Index and the Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Human Resources and Employment Services Index and assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.

Under the new guidance, we are required to present non-service cost components of net benefit cost in interest and other expenses, as opposed to selling and administrative expenses. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Measures — Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our 26 industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are included on pages 38 and 39. Results of Operations - For Years of Operation Ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 During 2018 , t he United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in Europe, having a favorable impact on our reported results. While our reported revenues from services increased 4.5% from 2017 , our reported operating profit increased 0.9% , and our net earnings per share – diluted increased 6.5% , these results were impacted by the relative strength of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to 2017 , and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 2.0% favorable impact on revenues from services, a 1.3% favorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.08 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. In 2018 , we experienced uneven results as we saw constant currency revenue declines in the United States, Northern Europe, and Right Management, while we saw constant-currency revenue growth in Other Americas, France, Italy, Other Southern Europe and APME. Our consolidated revenues were up 2.5% in constant currency in 2018 compared to 2017 . We experienced increasing demand in the first half of the year while demand softened to a nearly flat consolidated growth rate in the second half of the year, primarily driven by lower growth rates or declines in constant currency in most of our European markets, most notably France, Italy and Germany. Our 2018 results reflect a slower growth environment during the second half of the year in certain markets within Southern and Northern Europe, which when combined represented approximately 67% of our total consolidated revenues. We expect the European economic slowdown experienced in the second half of 2018 to continue into at least the first quarter of 2019. Beyond that, we cannot predict if the trend will continue, reverse or intensify. The constant currency revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to a decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. We experienced better performance from our Southern Europe segment than from our Northern Europe segment, as discussed below under ""Segment Results"" due to the revenue increases in Italy, France, and certain other markets within Southern Europe. France experienced uneven but declining economic conditions with certain economic indicators and business confidence measures reaching their lowest point during the second half of 2018. Our ManpowerGroup Solutions business had strong growth in 2018 in addition to a 6.9% constant currency increase ( 8.4% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. At Right Management, we experienced a constant currency revenue decline for both our outplacement services, due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business, and our talent management services. Our gross profit margin in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to the decline in our staffing/interim gross profit margin. The staffing/interim gross profit margin decline is due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019, and business mix changes in various countries. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan. The margin also declined due to the decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. These declines were partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business. The CICE payroll tax credit is accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period, and has had a favorable impact on our consolidated gross margin, as well as margins in France and Southern Europe since 2013. The CICE program was replaced with new subsidies starting in January 2019 and we expect this replacement to have a 27 negative impact on our gross profit margin. The new subsidies and their anticipated impact is discussed in the section, ""Legal Regulations,"" found in Item 1. ""Business."" Our operating profit decreased in 2018 , down 0.4% in constant currency ( 0.9% increase as reported) with operating profit margin down 20 basis points compared to 2017 . Included in 2018 and 2017 were $39.3 million and $34.5 million , respectively, of restructuring costs primarily related to the integration of certain acquisitions and front-office, back-office and delivery-model optimization. Excluding the restructuring costs in both 2018 and 2017 , our operating profit was down 0.2% in constant currency with operating profit margin down 10 basis points compared to 2017 . We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities. Consolidated Results - 2018 compared to 2017 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2018 as compared to 2017 . (in millions, except per share data) 2018 2017 Reported Variance Variance in Constant Currency Variance in Organic Constant Currency Revenues from services $ 21,991.2 $ 21,034.3 4.5 % 2.5 % 2.2 % Cost of services 18,412.2 17,549.7 4.9 2.8 Gross profit 3,579.0 3,484.6 2.7 0.9 0.5 Gross profit margin 16.3 % 16.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 2,782.3 2,695.4 3.2 1.3 1.0 Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues 12.7 % 12.8 % Operating profit 796.7 789.2 0.9 (0.4 ) (1.2 ) Operating profit margin 3.6 % 3.8 % Net interest expense 41.0 44.6 Other expenses 1.0 7.3 Earnings before income taxes 754.7 737.3 2.4 1.1 Provision for income taxes 198.0 191.9 3.2 Effective income tax rate 26.2 % 26.0 % Net earnings $ 556.7 $ 545.4 2.1 1.1 Net earnings per share — diluted $ 8.56 $ 8.04 6.5 5.5 Weighted average shares — diluted 65.1 67.9 (4.1 )% The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 4.5% ( 2.5% in constant currency and 2.2% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where revenues increased 8.3% ( 4.0% in constant currency) and 1.2% ( -2.0% in constant currency), respectively. This included a revenue increase in France of 6.4% ( 1.9% in constant currency), primarily due to strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market and a 14.5% increase ( 9.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The Southern Europe increase also included an increase in Italy of 13.2% ( 8.3% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase ( 10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. We also experienced revenue growth in the Nordics, Spain and Belgium of 0.3% , 9.0% and 6.5% , respectively ( 0.1% , 4.4% , and 2.0% , respectively, in constant currency; 2.5% , in organic constant currency in Spain). Lastly, we experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands of 3.2% and 0.4% , respectively, while revenues decreased 0.4% and 4.2% , respectively, in constant currency; • a revenue increase in APME of 9.6% ( 9.4% in constant currency and 8.7% in organic constant currency) primarily due to an increase in our staffing/interim revenues and a 9.9% increase ( 10.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business; 28 • our acquisitions in the Americas, Southern Europe, and APME, which added approximately 0.3% revenue growth to our consolidated results; • a 2.0% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and • the favorable impact of approximately 0.4% as reported and in constant currency due to one additional billing day in the year; partially offset by • a revenue decrease in the United States of 5.1% primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business; and • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 8.5% ( -9.4% in constant currency), including a 10.3% decrease ( -11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as well as a 2.9% decrease ( -3.3% in constant currency) in our talent management business. The year-over-year 30 basis point ( -0.30% ) decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 30 basis point (-0.30%) unfavorable impact from the decline in our staffing/interim margin due to the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate in France and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 and business mix changes in various countries, partially offset by favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018, primarily in France and Japan.; and • a 10 basis point (-0.10%) unfavorable impact from decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management; partially offset by • a 10 basis point (0.10%) favorable impact from the 8.4% ( 6.9% in constant currency) increase in our permanent recruitment business. The 3.2% increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2018 ( 1.3% in constant currency; 1.0% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 15.5% increase (13.3% in constant currency and 13.1% in organic constant currency) in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects, delivery model and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities ; • restructuring costs of $39.3 million incurred in 2018, comprised of $0.3 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $33.3 million in Northern Europe and $0.3 million in Right Management, compared to $34.5 million incurred in 2017, comprised of $6.3 million the Americas, $23.8 million Northern Europe, $1.4 million in APME, $2.0 million in Right Management and $1.0 million in corporate expenses; • a 1.9% increase due to the impact of changes in the currency exchange rates; and • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $10.0 million incurred as a result of acquisitions in the Americas, Southern Europe and APME; partially offset by • an $8.4 million decrease related to a gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands; and • a 3.1% decrease (-4.9% in constant currency and -5.2% in organic constant currency) in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in certain markets . Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 10 basis points ( -0.10% ) in 2018 compared to 2017 . The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of: • a 10 basis point (-0.10%) favorable impact from better expense leverage as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency; and • a 10 basis point (-0.10%) favorable impact due to the decrease in variable incentive costs; partially offset by • a 10 basis point (0.10%) unfavorable impact due to the consulting costs incurred in 2018. 29 Interest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Interest and other expenses were $42.0 million in 2018 compared to $51.9 million in 2017 . Net interest expense decreased $3.6 million in 2018 to $41.0 million from $44.6 million in 2017 due to the lower interest rate on our €500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Foreign exchange losses in 2018 were $1.4 million compared to $0.8 million in 2017 . The increase in foreign exchange losses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $2.5 million translation loss in Argentina as a result of the highly-inflationary designation of its economy as of July 1, 2018, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units and translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States in 2018 . Miscellaneous income was $0.4 million in 2018 compared to miscellaneous expense of $6.5 million in 2017 . The variance is primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.2% in 2018 , as compared to an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017 . The 26.2% effective tax rate for 2018 was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the French business tax. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately 34% due primarily to the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable. Net earnings per share - diluted was $8.56 in 2018 compared to $8.04 in 2017 . Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.08 in 2018 . Restructuring costs recorded in 2018 and 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.46 and $0.41 per share, net of tax, for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The gain from the sale of the Netherlands' language translation business favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The translation loss from the Argentina highly-inflationary designation recorded in 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share- diluted by approximately $0.04 per share, net of tax, for 2018. The net tax benefits related to the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.1% to 65.1 million in 2018 from 67.9 million in 2017 . This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2017, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2018. 30 Consolidated Results - 2017 compared to 2016 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2017 as compared to 2016 . (in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 Reported Variance Variance in Constant Currency Variance in Organic Constant Currency Revenues from services $ 21,034.3 $ 19,654.1 7.0 % 6.0 % 5.5 % Cost of services 17,549.7 16,320.3 7.5 6.4 Gross profit 3,484.6 3,333.8 4.5 3.6 3.1 Gross profit margin 16.6 % 17.0 % Selling and administrative expenses 2,695.4 2,588.3 4.1 3.5 2.9 Selling and administrative expenses as a % of revenues 12.8 % 13.2 % Operating profit 789.2 745.5 5.9 4.0 4.2 Operating profit margin 3.8 % 3.8 % Net interest expense 44.6 45.9 Other expense (income) 7.3 (1.7 ) Earnings before income taxes 737.3 701.3 5.1 3.5 Provision for income taxes 191.9 257.6 (25.5 ) Effective income tax rate 26.0 % 36.7 % Net earnings $ 545.4 $ 443.7 22.9 21.3 Net earnings per share — diluted $ 8.04 $ 6.27 28.2 26.6 Weighted average shares — diluted 67.9 70.8 (4.2 )% The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 7.0% ( 6.0% in constant currency and 5.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • increased demand for services in several of our markets within Southern Europe and Northern Europe, where in constant currency revenues increased 12.7% ( 15.5% as reported) and 3.4% ( 3.5% as reported; 2.6% in organic constant currency), respectively. This included a constant currency revenue increase in France of 10.6% ( 13.2% as reported), primarily due to strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market and growth in our Proservia business, and an 8.3% constant currency increase ( 10.5% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. This increase also included a constant currency revenue increase in Italy of 23.3% ( 26.4% as reported) due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 23.7% constant currency increase ( 26.0% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. We also experienced constant currency revenue growth in Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordics, Spain and Belgium of 10.1% , 12.6% , 6.6% , 12.3% , and 4.5% , respectively ( 12.5% , 15.2% , 7.6% , 15.1% and 6.8% , respectively, as reported; 8.4% , 5.1% and 5.2% , in organic constant currency in the Netherlands, the Nordics and Spain, respectively); • a revenue increase in APME of 6.4% in constant currency ( 6.7% as reported; 6.1% in organic constant currency) primarily due to an increase in our staffing/interim revenues, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 10.8% constant currency increase ( 12.1% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business; and • our acquisitions in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME, which added approximately 0.5% revenue growth to our consolidated results on a constant currency basis; partially offset by • a revenue decrease in the United States of 6.3% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the prolonged weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector due to decreased demand at several large clients, and a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work; 31 • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 15.6% in constant currency ( -15.8% as reported), including a 14.9% constant currency decrease ( -15.3% as reported) in our outplacement services as well as an 18.0% constant currency decline ( -17.6% as reported) in our talent management business; • a 1.0% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and • the unfavorable impact of approximately 0.4% in constant currency due to one fewer billing day in the year. The year-over-year 40 basis point ( -0.40% ) decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 30 basis point (-0.30%) unfavorable impact from the decline in our Manpower staffing margin, particularly in France, Italy, Germany, and the Nordics, due primarily to changes in business mix; and • a 10 basis point (-0.10%) unfavorable impact from decreased demand in our outplacement business at Right Management. The 4.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2017 (3.5% in constant currency; 2.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • restructuring costs of $34.5 million incurred in 2017, comprised of $6.3 million in the Americas, $23.8 million in Northern Europe, $1.4 million in APME, $2.0 million in Right Management and $1.0 million in corporate expenses; • a 15.8% increase in constant currency (16.8% as reported; 14.6% in organic constant currency) in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities; • a 0.8% increase in constant currency (1.5% as reported) in organic salary-related costs, primarily because of additional headcount to support the increased demand for our services specifically in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $16.6 million incurred as a result of acquisitions in Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME; and • a 0.6% increase due to the impact of changes in the currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 1.1% constant currency decrease (-0.4% as reported) in other organic non-personnel related costs as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 40 basis points (-0.40%) in 2017 compared to 2016 . The change in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues consisted of: • a 50 basis point (-0.50%) favorable impact from better expense leverage as a result of our strong focus on productivity and efficiency; and • a 10 basis point (-0.10%) decrease due to the impact on business mix of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 20 basis point (0.20%) unfavorable impact due to the restructuring costs noted above. Interest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Interest and other expenses were $51.9 million in 2017 compared to $44.2 million in 2016 . Net interest expense decreased $1.3 million in 2017 to $44.6 million from $45.9 million in 2016 due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates on investments. Foreign exchange losses in 2017 were $0.8 million compared to $2.8 million in 2016 . The foreign exchange losses in 2017 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, partially offset by translation gains resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States. The foreign exchange losses in 2016 were primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts from translation of amounts denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in a few of our reporting units, translation losses resulting from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the United States, and a foreign currency loss as a result of the change in the exchange rate in our Venezuela reporting unit. Miscellaneous expense was $6.5 million in 2017 compared to miscellaneous income of $4.5 million in 2016 . The variance between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to a $6.9 million pension curtailment gain in 2016 and an increase in expenses related to net earnings 32 attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by a gain on the sale of investments by our minority-owned Swiss Franchise recorded in 2017. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 26.0% in 2017 , as compared to an effective rate of 36.7% in 2016 . This decrease was primarily due to the $ 73.7 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act, offset by the tax expense from French tax reform. These enactments resulted in the net reduction of United States tax liabilities of $247.4 million offset by the United States transition tax expense of $170.2 million and a decrease in the French deferred tax assets of $3.5 million. Excluding the impact of these enactments, our rate would have been 36.0%. This is higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35%, the rate in effect prior to the Tax Act, due primarily to the French business tax and other permanent items, offset by the favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting guidance for share-based payments effective January 1, 2017, the favorable settlement of an audit and the net release of valuation allowances. Net earnings per share - diluted was $8.04 in 2017 compared to $6.27 in 2016 . Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.10 in 2017 . The net tax benefits related to the Tax Act and the French tax reform positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.09 per share in 2017. Restructuring costs recorded in 2017 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.41 per share, net of tax. The tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of an audit and the adoption of new accounting guidance for share-based payments positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.13 and $0.09, respectively, in 2017. We adopted the new accounting guidance for share-based payments in January 2017 and it required all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based compensation to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than capital in excess of par value on a prospective basis. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased 4.2% to 67.9 million in 2017 from 70.8 million in 2016 . This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2017 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2016, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2017. Segment Results We evaluate performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.4% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency and 0.4% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 . In the United States, revenues from services decreased 5.1% in 2018 compared to 2017 , primarily driven by a decline in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand from larger clients, a decline in our Manpower staffing services due to reduced demand from certain clients, and a 3.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 5.1% ( 12.4% in constant currency; 9.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 . We experienced constant currency revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 8.3% , 9.5% , 15.2% , 14.9% , 4.5% , and 14.0% ( 6.2% , 9.3% , -27.6% , 14.6% , 3.6% , and -0.1% , respectively, as reported). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. In 2017 , revenues from services decreased 1.9% ( -1.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016 . In the United States, revenues from services decreased 6.3% in 2017 compared to 2016 , primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services, mainly due to the reduced staffing volumes in the manufacturing sector of the economy, a decrease in our Experis interim services, specifically within the IT sector because of decreased demand by several large clients, a decrease in ManpowerGroup Solutions business due to a specific client loss and roll off of certain project work, and an unfavorable impact from one fewer billing day. In Other 33 Americas, revenues from services increased 6.6% (7.1% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016 . We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia and Peru of 11.1%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 6.9%, and 10.9%, respectively (12.0%, 2.3%, 17.5%, 3.7%, and 7.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Brazil of 10.4% (-17.0 in constant currency) due to the non-recurrence of the business associated with the Rio Olympics in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to business mix changes within our staffing/interim business, as revenue growth came from our lower-margin entities within Other Americas as well as a decline in the United States' staffing/interim margin due to the non-recurrence of certain prior year favorable reductions related to workers' compensation and health care costs in the United States. In 2017 , gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 as a result of improved staffing/interim margin in the United States due to lower direct costs primarily related to workers' compensation and health care costs, partially offset by decreases in our staffing/interim margins within some of our markets in Other Americas because of business mix changes. In 2018 , selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.8% ( -0.7% in constant currency; -1.4% in organic constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount in the United States and a decrease in restructuring costs to $0.3 million in 2018 from $6.3 million in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by increased costs related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition in Other Americas. In 2017 , selling and administrative expenses decreased 4.1% (-3.8% in constant currency), due primarily to strong cost management and a decline in salary-related expenses as a result of lower headcount. These decreases were partially offset by $6.3 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2017 primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with United States back-office optimization and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities. OUP margin in the Americas was 4.9% , 5.1% and 4.6% for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In the United States, OUP margin was 5.2% , 5.7% and 5.0% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The margin decrease in 2018 in the United States was primarily due to the increased costs as a result of investment in certain technology and back-office and delivery model optimization activities and the decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. Other Americas OUP margin was 4.5% , 3.9% and 3.7% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The margin increased in Other Americas in 2018 compared to 2017 due to improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2018 and a decrease in the gross profit margin. The margin increase in the Americas in 2017 was primarily due to the United States as a result of the improvement in the gross profit margin and strong cost management, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Southern Europe In 2018 , revenues from services in Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, increased 8.3% ( 4.0% in constant currency) compared to 2017 . In 2018 , revenues from services increased 6.4% ( 1.9% in constant currency) in France (which represents 62% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and increased 13.2% ( 8.3% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 18% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the strong growth in our large client accounts within the staffing market in the first half of the year and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 14.5% ( 9.1% in constant currency). The increase in Italy is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 15.9% increase ( 10.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 9.9% ( 6.8% in constant currency, 6.1% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 , primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 9.0% increase ( 4.4% in constant currency; 2.5% in organic constant currency) in Spain, the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 21.9% ( 19.1% in constant currency) and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. In 2017 , revenues from services in Southern Europe increased 15.5% (12.7% in constant currency) compared to 2016. In 2017, revenues from services increased 13.2% (10.6% in constant currency) in France and increased 26.4% (23.3% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France was primarily due to the strong growth in our 34 large client accounts within the staffing market, growth in our Proservia business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 10.5% (8.3% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. The increase in Italy was mostly due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase of 26.0% (23.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 14.2% (10.8% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an increase of 15.1% (12.3% in constant currency; 5.2% in organic constant currency) in Spain primarily due to the increase in our Experis business, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 27.5% (23.9% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days. Gross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in Italy's Manpower staffing margin as a result of business mix changes and pricing pressures, while France's staffing/interim margin was flat as the decrease in the CICE payroll tax credit rate and the loss of the December 2018 CICE subsidy as a result of the transition from the CICE program to a new subsidy program in January 2019 were offset by various initiatives as well as favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 17.5% ( 13.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in France's staffing margin, as a result of business mix changes in a competitive pricing environment as we have experienced growth in our lower-margin large client accounts and pricing pressures, partially offset by the increase in the CICE subsidy effective January 1, 2017, and decreases in Italy's Manpower staffing margin primarily due to pricing pressures and business mix changes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 19.9% (17.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In 2018 , selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4% ( 4.9% in constant currency; 4.8% in organic constant currency) compared to 2017 , primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount, restructuring costs of $5.4 million incurred in 2018, and an increase in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.9% (6.4% in constant currency; 5.7% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in Spain. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.0% , 5.1% and 5.1% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. France's OUP margin was 5.0% , 5.1% and 5.2% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. France's margin decrease in 2018 was primarily due an increase in expenses as we invest to support higher growth. Italy’s OUP margin was 6.7% , 7.1% and 6.8% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Italy’s margin decrease in 2018 was due to the decline in the gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2018 , partially offset by improved operational leverage, as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin was 3.5% , 3.5% and 3.2% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The margin in Southern Europe in 2017 was flat compared to 2016 as improved operational leverage on increased revenues was offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 31% , 20% , 20% , 14% and 8% , respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 1.2% ( -2.0% in constant currency) in 2018 as compared to 2017 . We experienced revenue growth in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 3.2% , 0.3% , 0.4% and 6.5% , respectively ( -0.4% , 0.1% , -4.2% , and 2.0% , respectively, in constant currency) and a decline in Germany of 3.6% ( -8.3% in constant currency). The Northern Europe constant currency revenue decrease is due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from challenges with the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Proservia business, a 6.6% increase ( 3.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, and increased demand for our Experis interim services, primarily within the IT sector in the United Kingdom. 35 In 2017, revenues from services increased 3.5% (3.4% in constant currency; 2.6% in organic constant currency) as compared to 2016. We experienced revenue growth in Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 12.5%, 7.6%, 15.2% and 6.8% , respectively (10.1%, 6.6%, 12.6%, and 4.5%, respectively, in constant currency; 5.1% and 8.4% in organic constant currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands) and a decline in the United Kingdom of 11.1% (-6.5% in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue increase is due to growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, mostly within our Proservia business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 4.6% increase (5.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. These increases were partially offset by reduced demand within our largest client accounts in the United Kingdom and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. Gross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes and lower associate utilization in Germany, partially offset by the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business. In 2017, gross profit margin was flat compared to 2016 as the increase in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and increase in our permanent recruitment business was offset by the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.0% ( -1.8% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the increase in restructuring costs of $33.3 million in 2018 from $23.8 million in 2017. The 2018 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium. The 2017 restructuring costs were primarily related to severance costs incurred in connection with the further integration of 7S Group GmbH (""7S"") in Germany, branch and back-office optimization in the United Kingdom and management and back-office optimization along with the integration of an Experis acquisition in the Netherlands. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2.7% in constant currency (increase of 0.8% as reported) primarily due to a $8.4 million gain from the sale of a non-core language translation business in the Netherlands and a decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction of headcount, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% (8.3% in constant currency; 7.0% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016 due primarily to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Excluding the restructuring costs, selling and administrative expenses increased 4.9% (4.5% in constant currency; 3.3% in organic constant currency), primarily due to an increase in organic salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount in certain countries to support the increase in revenues, the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the acquisitions in the Nordics and the Netherlands and an increase in consulting costs primarily related to certain technology projects and back-office and delivery-model optimization activities. OUP margin for Northern Europe was 2.3% , 2.6% and 3.2% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit margin, the increased costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, and an increase in restructuring costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017 and the increase in consulting costs. APME Revenues from services increased 9.6% ( 9.4% in constant currency; 8.7% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 . In Japan (which represents 31% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 4.7% ( 3.1% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 16.1% increase ( 14.3% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 20% of APME’s revenues), revenue from services increased 2.4% ( 5.1% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Manpower staffing business and a 4.6% increase ( 6.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia and an increase in our permanent recruitment businesses. In 2017 , revenues from services for APME increased 6.7% (6.4% in constant currency; 6.1% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. In Japan, revenues from services increased 1.0% (4.4% in constant currency) due to 36 the increase in our staffing/interim business and a 10.7% increase (14.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia, revenue from services decreased 1.0% in constant currency (increase of 2.1% as reported) due to the decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services in constant currency as we saw a slowing of new business and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 7.2% increase in constant currency (10.7% as reported) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in Greater China, India, Singapore and Thailand, and growth in our ManpowerGroup Solutions and permanent recruitment businesses. Gross profit margin increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margin as a result of favorable direct costs adjustments in 2018 in Japan, increase in our permanent recruitment business of 9.9% ( 10.2% in constant currency), and a margin increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. In 2017, gross profit margin increased compared to 2016 due to an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 12.1% (10.8% in constant currency) and growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, partially offset by a decrease in our staffing/interim margins as a result of direct cost increases in certain markets and changes in business mix. Selling and administrative expenses increased 8.4% ( 8.2% in constant currency; 6.9% in organic constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 . The increase is due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increase in revenues and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of an acquisition, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in 2018 from $1.4 million incurred in 2017 in Australia related to branch and back-office optimization. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses increased 6.0% (5.9% in constant currency; 5.5% in organic constant currency) compared to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs because of higher headcount to support the increases in revenues and due to the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. OUP margin for APME was 4.0% , 3.8% and 3.6% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The OUP margin increased in 2018 due to improved operating leverage on increased revenues and the improvement in the gross profit margin. The OUP margin increase in 2017 was due to the increase in our gross profit margin and better operational leverage, because we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Right Management In 2018 , revenues from services for Right Management decreased 8.5% ( -9.4% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 10.3% ( -11.3% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced reduced demand in most of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business. Our talent management business decreased 2.9% ( -3.3% in constant currency) in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decline in our Americas markets. In 2017, revenues from services decreased 15.8% (-15.6% in constant currency). The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of 15.3% (-14.9% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced softer demand in many of our markets due to the counter-cyclical nature of this business and the non-recurrence of certain client activity within the United States. Our talent management business decreased 17.6% (-18.0% in constant currency) in 2017 compared to 2016 mostly due to softening demand in our Asian markets. Gross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins and the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix. In 2017, gross profit margin decreased due to decreases in both our outplacement and talent management business gross profit margins. In 2018 , selling and administrative expenses decreased 9.7% ( -10.6% in constant currency) compared to 2017 primarily due to reduced compensation-related expenses, such as salaries and variable-incentive costs, due to lower headcount, and the decrease in restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2017, selling and administrative expenses decreased 15.4% (-15.1% in constant currency) compared to 2016 due to reduced compensation-related expenses such as salaries and variable-incentive costs due to lower headcount and a decrease in office-related costs related to a decrease in the number of offices. These items were partially offset by the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. 37 OUP margin for Right Management was 16.4% , 16.5% and 17.3% for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The OUP margin for 2018 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin, partially offset by improved operational leverage and the decrease of restructuring costs incurred in 2018 compared to 2017. The OUP margin for 2017 decreased due to the decline in our gross profit margin and the restructuring costs incurred in 2017. Financial Measures Constant Currency And Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Certain constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances are discussed throughout this report.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $331.2 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we have no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2018 , deferred taxes related to non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,729.3 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $15.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We have an additional $292.5 million of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries for which we have not currently provided deferred taxes. Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, capital expenditures, debt payments, interest expense, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables, which generally increase as revenues increase. The amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivables turnover, which differs in each market where we operate. Cash provided by operating activities was $483.1 , $400.9 and $600.0 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $198.3 million of cash in 2018 , as compared to $78.9 million and $49.7 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The change in 2018 from 2017 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date. The change in 2017 from 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the growth in the business and changes in business mix, partially offset by the timing of collections and payments. The CICE payroll tax credit is creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. In April 2018, March 2017 and March 2016, we sold substantially all of our CICE earned in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for net proceeds of $234.5 million ( €190.9 million ), $143.5 million ( €133.0 million ) and $143.1 million ( €129.9 million ), respectively. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective years in cost of services. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018 from $5,370.5 million as of December 31, 2017 . This decrease is due to changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO""). DSO increased by approximately two days from December 31, 2017 , due primarily to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. Capital expenditures were $64.7 million, $54.7 million and $56.9 million during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs of $5.6 million in 2018 , $1.7 million in 2017 and $0.9 million in 2016 . From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $51.8 million, $45.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million ($ 18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date). The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $32.7 million and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $13.0 million, of which $10.3 million was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S in Germany. The 2016 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $57.6 million and contingent consideration payments of $2.9 million. 40 Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic positioning and synergies. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for net cash proceeds of $13.2 million and divested a majority interest in a consolidated entity in China with an immaterial cash impact. As of December 31, 2018 , goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $6.1 and $0.7 , respectively. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2017 acquisitions were $35.0 and $13.3 , respectively, the majority of which took place in India and Hong Kong. Cash provided by net debt borrowings was $178.2 million and $5.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to net debt repayments of $6.7 million in 2016 . In June 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026, with the net proceeds of €495.7 million predominantly used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018. (See the ""Euro Notes"" section below for further information.) The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2018, July 2016 and October 2015. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 million. In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $203.9 million under the 2016 authorization. In 2016, we repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares, comprised of 1.3 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 5.3 million shares under the 2015 authorization, at a total cost of $482.2 million. As of December 31, 2018 , there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining under the 2016 and 2015 authorizations. We have aggregate commitments of $2,202.2 million related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments, as follows: (in millions) Total 2019 2020–2021 2022–2023 Thereafter Long-term debt including interest $1,140.2 $18.8 $37.5 $486.0 $597.9 Short-term borrowings 49.9 49.9 — — — Operating leases 566.8 151.4 200.7 109.1 105.6 Severances and other office closure costs 15.5 13.8 1.2 0.5 — Transition tax resulting from the Tax Act 128.6 0.3 24.3 34.9 69.1 Other 301.2 112.8 117.2 36.8 34.4 $2,202.2 $347.0 $380.9 $667.3 $807.0 Our liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, of $34.2 million is excluded from the commitments above as we cannot determine the years in which these positions might ultimately be settled. We recorded net restructuring costs of $39.3 million and $34.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries. During 2018 and 2017 , we made payments of $37.3 million and $25.5 million, respectively, out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remaining $15.5 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2019 . We have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total approximately $190.3 million and $201.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively ( $139.0 million and $149.3 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.3 million and $52.6 million for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit relate to workers’ compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.9 million for both 2018 and 2017 . 41 Total capitalization as of December 31, 2018 was $3,773.9 million, comprised of $1,075.4 million in debt and $2,698.5 million in equity. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 28% as of December 31, 2018 and 25% as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June 22, 2026 (the “€500.0 million notes”). The net proceeds from the €500.0 million notes of €495.7 million were used to repay our €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 million notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809%. Interest on the €500.0 million notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 million notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €400.0 million aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the ""€400.0 million notes"") are due September 2022. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million notes or the €400.0 million notes. Both the €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of taxes, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See the Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations section and Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement On June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 million in various currencies, and up to $150.0 million may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million and $599.2 million were available to us under the facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. A downgrade from both credit agencies would unfavorably impact our facility fees and result in additional costs ranging from approximately $0.2 million to $0.8 million annually. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. 42 As defined in the Credit Agreement, we had a net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.97 to 1 (compared to the maximum allowable ratio of 3.5 to 1) and a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 5.35 to 1 (compared to the minimum required ratio of 1.5 to 1) as of December 31, 2018 . Other In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2018 , such uncommitted credit lines totaled $319.9 million, of which $269.1 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $249.2 million could have been made under these lines as of December 31, 2018 . Our long-term debt has a rating of Baa1 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Standard and Poor's, both with a stable outlook. Both of the credit ratings are investment grade. Rating agencies use proprietary methodology in determining their ratings and outlook which includes, among other things, financial ratios based upon debt levels and earnings performance. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Employment-Related Items The employment of contingent workers and permanent staff throughout the world results in the recognition of liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans, social program remittances and payroll tax audit exposures that require us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the proper reserve levels. These reserves involve significant estimates or judgments that are material to our financial statements. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees. The most significant plans are located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Annual expense relating to these plans was $13.9 million , $11.2 million and $3.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $15.1 million in 2019. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (""net benefit cost""). The new guidance requires bifurcation of net benefit cost, which used to be reported as an employee cost within operating income under the old guidance. The service cost component is still presented with other employee compensation cost in operating income or capitalized in assets in rare circumstances. The other components are now reported separately outside of operations, and are not eligible for capitalization. We have reclassified the prior year non-service cost components of net benefit cost to interest and other expenses from selling and administrative expenses to conform to the current period presentation. The non-service cost components related to our defined benefit pension plans were a net cost of $3.0 million and $1.1 million and a net credit of $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) The calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year-end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary. We review market data and historical rates, on a country-by-country basis, to check for reasonableness in setting both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected returns of the various investment asset classes held in the plans. We estimate compensation increases and employee turnover rates for each plan based on the historical rates and the expected future rates for each respective country. Changes to any of these assumptions will impact the level of annual expense recorded related to the plans. 43 In determining the estimated 2019 pension expense for non-United States plans, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.4% compared to 2.1% for 2018, reflecting the current interest rate environment. We have selected a weighted-average expected return on plan assets of 2.4% for the non-United States plans in determining the 2019 estimated pension expense compared to 2.7% used for the calculation of the 2018 pension expense. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase and decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would impact our 2019 consolidated pension expense by a decrease of approximately $0.5 million and an increase of approximately $0.3 million, respectively. Absent any other changes, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets would correspondingly decrease or increase our 2019 consolidated pension expense by approximately $0.9 million. Changes to these assumptions have historically not been significant in any jurisdiction for any reporting period, and no significant adjustments to the amounts recorded have been required in the past or are expected in the future. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information.) Social Program Remittances and Payroll Tax Audit Exposure On a routine basis, various governmental agencies in some of the countries and territories in which we operate audit our payroll tax calculations and our compliance with other payroll-related regulations. These audits focus primarily on documentation requirements and our support for our payroll tax remittances. Due to the nature of our business, the number of people that we employ, and the complexity of some payroll tax regulations, we may have some adjustments to the payroll tax remittances as a result of these audits. We make an estimate of the additional remittances that may be required on a country-by-country basis, and record the estimate as a component of cost of services or selling and administrative expenses, as appropriate. Each country’s estimate is based on the results of past audits and the number of years that have not yet been audited, with consideration for changing business volumes and changes to the payroll tax regulations. To the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates, we will need to make adjustments to our reserve balance, which will impact the results of the related operation and the operating segment in which it is reported. Other than France, we have not had any significant adjustments to the amounts recorded as a result of any payroll tax audits, and we do not expect any significant adjustments to the recorded amounts in the near term. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely. The accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions requires an evaluation process for all tax positions taken that involves a review of probability for sustaining a tax position. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is more likely than not, which is a 50% threshold, then the tax position is warranted and the largest amount, based on cumulative probability, that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement is recognized. An uncertain tax position, one which does not meet the 50% threshold, will not be recognized in the financial statements. Our judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded. Our net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified, or our estimates of future taxable income change, such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated. In addition, valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that our estimates of future taxable income change. We have unrecognized tax benefits related to items in various countries and territories. To the extent these items are settled for an amount different than we currently expect, the unrecognized tax benefit will be adjusted. We provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate. In determining this rate, we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide, as well as the tax rate that 44 will be in effect for each location. To the extent these estimates change during the year, or actual results differ from these estimates, our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year. In December 2017, the Tax Act made broad changes to the United States tax code, including a reduction of the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and a transition to a Territorial Tax regime resulting in a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of unremitted post-1986 non-United States earnings. The Tax Act also established new provisions related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI""), Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) and a Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (“BEAT”). The computation of these new provisions is highly complex, and our estimates could significantly change as a result of new rules or guidance from the various standard-setting bodies. During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued new guidance affecting the computation of our 2017 transition tax liability. As a result of the new guidance and additional analysis of the impacts of the Tax Act, we revised our provisional estimates recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 and as a result, recorded a tax expense of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the Tax Act. Such note is found in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests. Significant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2018 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 14.2% , and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. The table below provides our reporting units’ estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 77% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2018 . (in millions) France United States United Kingdom Germany Right Management Netherlands Estimated fair values $2,513.8 $1,307.2 $446.9 $431.1 $354.7 $227.6 Carrying values 1,186.7 808.1 372.7 363.3 143.5 138.6 45 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Significant Matters Affecting Results of Operations Market Risks We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Exchange Rates Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries and our Euro-denominated borrowings. For our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rates impact the United States dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in the subsidiaries and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries. Approximately 88% of our revenues and profits are generated outside of the United States, with 51% generated from our European operations with a Euro-functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, particularly the Euro, may have a significant impact on our reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates each month. Consequently, as the value of the United States dollar changes relative to the currencies of our major markets, our reported results vary. The United States dollar generally strengthened against many of the currencies of our major markets during 2018 , whereas it generally weakened in 2017 . Revenues from services in constant currency were 2.0% and 1.0% lower than reported revenues in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. A change in the strength of the United States dollar by an additional 10% would have impacted our revenues from services by approximately 8.8% and 8.7% from the amounts reported in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the United States dollar amount of our shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of our non-United States subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The United States dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 . Consequently, shareholders’ equity decreased by $108.7 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2018 . If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2018 , resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have increased by approximately $198.5 million from the amounts reported. As of December 31, 2017 the United States dollar weakened relative to many foreign currencies compared to December 31, 2016 . Consequently, shareholders’ equity increased by $141.6 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of December 31, 2017 . If the United States dollar had strengthened an additional 10% as of December 31, 2017 resulting translation adjustments recorded in shareholders’ equity would have decreased by approximately $136.2 million from the amounts reported. Although currency fluctuations impact our reported results and shareholders’ equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. We generally have few cross-border transfers of funds, except for transfers to the United States for payment of license fees and interest expense on intercompany loans, working capital loans made between the United States and our foreign subsidiaries, dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, and payments between certain countries and territories for services provided. To reduce the currency risk related to these transactions, we may borrow funds in the relevant foreign currency under our revolving credit agreement or we may enter into a forward contract to hedge the transfer. On occasion, forward contracts are designated as an economic hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018 , we had a translation loss of $4.2 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, as the net investment hedge was deemed effective. 46 As of December 31, 2018 , there were £3.5 ($4.5) million and €1.6 ($1.8) million and 172.8 ($1.5) million in Japanese Yen (“JPY”) of forward contracts that relate to cash flows owed to our foreign subsidiaries in 2018. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in the current period earnings. As of December 31, 2018 , we had outstanding $ 1,024.6 million in principal amount of Euro-denominated notes (€900.0 million). A portion of the notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018 . For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, both net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ equity increased by $35.2 million, net of tax, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2018 , due to the currency impact on these designated borrowings. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2018 , we had the following fixed- and variable-rate borrowings: (in millions) Amount Weighted- Average Interest Rate (1) Variable-rate borrowings $49.9 8.4 % Fixed-rate borrowings 1,025.5 1.8 Total debt $1,075.4 2.1 % (1) The rates are impacted by currency exchange rate movements. Sensitivity Analysis The following tables summarize our debt and derivative instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements. All computations below are based on the United States dollar spot rate as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The exchange rate computations assume a 10% appreciation or 10% depreciation of the Euro, British pound, and Japanese Yen to the United States dollar. The hypothetical impact of the stated change in rates on 2018 and 2017 total other comprehensive income (loss) for the Euro Notes and earnings before income taxes for the forward contracts is as follows: Movements in Exchange Rates 2018 (in millions) Market Sensitive Instrument 10% Depreciation 10% Appreciation Euro Notes: €500.0, 1.81% Notes due June 2026 $57.3 (1) ($57.3 ) (1) €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 45.9 (1) (45.9 ) (1) Forward contracts: £3.5 to $4.5 (0.4 ) 0.4 €1.6 to $1.8 (0.2 ) 0.2 ¥172.8 to $1.5 (0.2 ) 0.2 47 Movements in Exchange Rates 2017 (in millions) Market Sensitive Instrument 10% Depreciation 10% Appreciation Euro Notes: €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 $48.0 (1) ($48.0 ) (1) €350.0, 4.51% Notes due June 2018 42.0 (1) (42.0 ) (1) Forward contracts: £2.9 to $3.9 (0.4 ) 0.4 (1) Exchange rate movements are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss as these instruments have been designated as an economic hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency. The hypothetical (increases)/decreases in the fair value of our market sensitive instruments due to changes in our Euro Notes' quoted prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the forward contracts are as follows: As of December 31, 2018 Market Sensitive Instrument (in millions) 10% Decrease 10% Increase Euro Notes: €500.0, 1.81% Notes due June 2026 $57.5 (1) ($57.5 ) (1) €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 47.8 (1) (47.8 ) (1) Forward contracts: £3.5 to $4.5 (0.4 ) 0.4 € 1.6 to $1.8 (0.2 ) 0.2 ¥172.8 to $1.5 (0.2 ) 0.2 As of December 31, 2017 Market Sensitive Instrument (in millions) 10% Decrease 10% Increase Euro Notes: €400.0, 1.91% Notes due September 2022 $51.0 (1) ($51.0 ) (1) €350.0, 4.51% Notes due June 2018 43.0 (1) (43.0 ) (1) Forward contracts: £2.9 to $3.9 (0.4 ) 0.4 (1) This (increase)/decrease in fair value is not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, disclosure of the fair value is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Impact of Economic Conditions One of the principal attractions of using workforce solutions and service providers is to maintain a flexible supply of labor to meet changing economic conditions. Therefore, the industry has been and remains sensitive to economic cycles. To help minimize the effects of these economic cycles, we offer clients a continuum of services to meet their needs throughout the business cycle. We believe that the breadth of our operations and the diversity of our service mix cushion us against the impact of an adverse economic cycle in any single country or industry. However, adverse economic conditions in any of our largest markets, or in several markets simultaneously, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin February 22, 2019 50 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ManpowerGroup Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ManpowerGroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Inc. is a world leader in the innovative workforce solutions and services industry. Our global network of nearly 2,600 offices in 80 countries and territories allows us to meet the needs of our global, multinational and local clients across all major industry segments. Our largest operations, based on revenues, are located in France, the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom. We specialize in permanent, temporary and contract recruitment and assessment; training and development; outsourcing; career management and workforce consulting services. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include our operating results and the operating results of all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and the noncontrolling shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, or we have significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for equity investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our ownership share of earnings of these equity method investments, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments, as well as certain other relationships, are also evaluated for consolidation under the accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. These investments were $161.4 and $158.7 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are $105.2 and $103.9 , respectively, of unremitted earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration for historical write-off experience, the current aging of receivables and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. Bad debt expense is recorded as selling and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and was $23.0 , $18.1 and $20.4 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by our clients and other difficulties collecting amounts billed. On the other hand, an improved write-off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision. Write-offs were $12.0 , $17.6 and $16.9 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 56 Advertising Costs We expense production costs of advertising as they are incurred. Advertising expenses were $27.9 , $26.6 and $24.4 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $39.3 and $34.5 in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During 2018 and 2017 , we made payments of $37.3 and $25.5 , respectively, out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remaining $15.5 reserve will be paid by the end of 2019 . Changes in the restructuring liability balances for each reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate Total Balance, January 1, 2017 $0.4 $1.3 $2.6 $0.1 $0.1 $— $4.5 Severance costs 5.8 — 15.6 0.9 1.4 1.0 24.7 Office closure costs 0.5 — 8.2 0.5 0.6 — 9.8 Costs paid or utilized (5.0 ) (0.4 ) (16.8 ) (1.5 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (25.5 ) Balance, December 31, 2017 1.7 0.9 9.6 — 1.2 0.1 13.5 Severance costs 0.3 5.4 25.8 — 0.3 — 31.8 Office closure costs — — 7.5 — — — 7.5 Costs paid or utilized (1.7 ) (4.6 ) (29.8 ) — (1.1 ) (0.1 ) (37.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 $0.3 $1.7 $13.1 $— $0.4 $— $15.5 (1) Balance related to United States was $0.4 as of January 1, 2017. In 2017 , United States incurred $3.7 for severance costs and $0.5 for office closure costs and paid/utilized $3.1 , leaving a $1.5 liability as of December 31, 2017. In 2018 , United States paid/utilized $1.2 , leaving a $0.3 liability as of December 31, 2018 . (2) Balance related to France was $1.3 as of January 1, 2017. In 2017 , France paid/utilized $0.4 , leaving a $0.9 liability as of both December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Italy had no restructuring reserves recorded as of either January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017 . In 2018, Italy incurred $1.9 for severance costs and paid/utilized $1.4 , leaving a $0.5 liability as of December 31, 2018 . Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 57 Fair Value Measurements The assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2017 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Deferred compensation plan assets $89.5 $89.5 $— $— $99.1 $99.1 $— $— Foreign currency forward contracts 0.1 — 0.1 — — — — — $89.6 $89.5 $0.1 $— $99.1 $99.1 $— $— Liabilities Foreign currency forward contracts $0.1 $— $0.1 $— $0.1 $— $0.1 $— $0.1 $— $0.1 $— $0.1 $— $0.1 $— We determine the fair value of our deferred compensation plan assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is measured at the value from either directly or indirectly observable third parties. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $1,052.9 and $939.9 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $1,024.6 and $897.8 , respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We had goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,297.1 $ — $ 1,297.1 $ 1,343.0 $ — $ 1,343.0 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 444.8 $ 351.7 $ 93.1 $ 453.6 $ 325.2 $ 128.4 Other 18.5 16.0 2.5 19.3 14.7 4.6 463.3 367.7 95.6 472.9 339.9 133.0 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 98.7 — 98.7 99.0 — 99.0 150.7 — 150.7 151.0 — 151.0 Total intangible assets $ 614.0 $ 367.7 $ 246.3 $ 623.9 $ 339.9 $ 284.0 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $513.4 as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 . (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $139.5 as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 . 58 Amortization expense related to intangibles was $35.1 , $34.6 and $36.0 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Amortization expense expected in each of the next five years related to acquisitions completed as of December 31, 2018 is as follows: 2019 - $29.0 , 2020 - $24.2 , 2021 - $13.4 , 2022 - $9.9 and 2023 - $7.7 . The weighted-average useful lives of the customer relationships and other are approximately 13 and 4 years, respectively. The tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the tradenames, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. The reacquired franchise rights result from our franchise acquisitions in the United States and Canada completed prior to 2009. In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible as a result of our annual tests. For our goodwill impairment testing procedures, we determined the fair value of each reporting unit generally by utilizing an income approach derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. For certain of our reporting units, a combination of the income approach (weighted 75% ) and the market approach (weighted 25% ) derived from comparable public companies was utilized. The income approach is developed from management’s forecasted cash flow data. Therefore, it represents an indication of fair market value reflecting management’s internal outlook for the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes the Guideline Public Company Method to quantify the respective reporting unit’s fair value based on revenues and earnings multiples realized by similar public companies. The market approach is more volatile as an indicator of fair value as compared to the income approach. We believe that each approach has its merits. However, in the instances where we have utilized both approaches, we have weighted the income approach more heavily than the market approach because we believe that management’s assumptions generally provide greater insight into the reporting unit’s fair value. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 included: expected revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 14.2% for 2018 , and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and the expected operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We would record a goodwill impairment charge by the amount for which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. Under the current accounting guidance, we are also required to test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Marketable Securities We account for our marketable security investments in accordance with the accounting guidance on investments in debt and equity securities, and have historically determined that all such investments are classified as available-for-sale. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on financial instruments, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). 59 We hold a 49% interest in our Swiss franchise, accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which maintains an investment portfolio with a market value of $219.9 and $234.8 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The portfolio is comprised of a wide variety of European and United States debt and equity securities and various professionally-managed funds, all of which are classified as available-for-sale, as well as cash and cash equivalents. Since January 1, 2018, u pon adoption of the new accounting guidance, we have recognized all the changes in fair value on the investment portfolio in the current period earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, only our share of net realized gains and losses, and declines in value determined to be other-than-temporary, was included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our share of net unrealized gains and unrealized losses that were determined to be temporary related to these investments was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with the offsetting amount increasing or decreasing our investment in the franchise. For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , realized gains totaled $12.7 , $14.7 and $2.9 , respectively, and realized losses totaled $2.1 , $3.8 and $1.0 , respectively. Other-than-temporary impairment amounts were net gains of $0.1 , $1.6 and $0.3 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as previously impaired investments were sold for a gain. Capitalized Software for Internal Use We capitalize purchased software as well as internally developed software. Internal software development costs are capitalized from the time the internal use software is considered probable of completion until the software is ready for use. Business analysis, system evaluation, selection and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software which ranges from 3 to 10 years. The net capitalized software balance of $7.4 and $3.5 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense related to the capitalized software costs was $1.5 , $1.3 and $1.9 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Property and Equipment A summary of property and equipment as of December 31 is as follows: 2018 2017 Land $ 3.4 $ 3.4 Buildings 12.0 14.5 Furniture, fixtures, and autos 167.3 172.3 Computer equipment 128.7 137.1 Leasehold improvements 302.2 306.1 Property and equipment $ 613.6 $ 633.4 Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using primarily the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings - up to 40 years; furniture, fixtures, autos and computer equipment - 2 to 15 years; leasehold improvements - lesser of life of asset or expected lease term. Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized whereas expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to income as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of property and equipment, the difference between the unamortized cost and the proceeds is recorded as either a gain or a loss and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Derivative Financial Instruments We account for our derivative instruments in accordance with the accounting guidance on derivative instruments and hedging activities. Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the Consolidated 60 Statements of Operations when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of our non-United States subsidiaries have been translated in accordance with the accounting guidance on foreign currency translation. Under the accounting guidance, asset and liability accounts are translated at the current exchange rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rates each month. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in shareholders’ equity. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes is accounted for as a hedge of our net investment in our subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the amount of the related borrowings, net of tax, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Shareholders’ Equity The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock in each of August 2018, July 2016 and October 2015. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. In 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.7 million shares, comprised of 2.9 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization, at a total cost of $500.7 . In 2017, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $203.9 under the 2016 authorization. In 2016, we repurchased a total of 6.6 million shares, comprised of 1.3 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 5.3 million shares under the 2015 authorization, at a total cost of $482.2 . As of December 31, 2018 , there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining under the 2016 and 2015 authorizations. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Board of Directors declared total cash dividends of $2.02 , $1.86 and $1.72 per share, respectively, resulting in total dividend payments of $127.3 , $123.7 and $118.4 , respectively. Noncontrolling interests, included in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded income of $4.9 for 2018 and expenses of $6.5 and $10.1 for 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The income recorded in 2018 was due to a revision in one of our joint venture agreements. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Payroll Tax Credit In January 2013, the French government passed legislation, Credit d’Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi (“CICE”), that provides payroll tax credits based on a percentage of wages paid to employees receiving less than two-and-a-half times the French minimum wage. The payroll tax credit was equal to 4% of eligible wages in 2013, 6% of eligible wages in 2014 to 2016, 7% of eligible wages in 2017, and 6% of eligible wages in 2018. The CICE payroll tax credit was accounted for as a reduction of our cost of services in the period earned. The payroll tax credit is creditable against our current French income tax payable, with any remaining amount being paid after three years. Given the amount of our current income taxes payable, we would generally receive the vast majority of these payroll tax credits after the three -year period. In April 2018, March 2017 and March 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the credits earned in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for 61 net proceeds of $234.5 ( €190.9 ), $143.5 ( €133.0 ) and $143.1 ( €129.9 ), respectively. We derecognized these receivables upon the sale as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits earned in the respective year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new accounting guidance on leases. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. Similar to the current guidance, the recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depends on its classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. The new guidance also includes new disclosure requirements providing information on the amounts recorded in the financial statements. We adopted the new lease guidance effective January 1, 2019, and will recognize any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date, without restating prior periods. We elected the package of three practical expedients which lessens the transitional burden of implementing the new guidance. Accordingly, we will not reassess: 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; or 3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. We also elected the land easements practical expedient allowing us to not reassess whether existing or expired land easements not accounted for as leases under previous guidance are or contain a lease under new guidance. We implemented internal controls and key system functionality, including a new global lease software system, to enable the preparation of financial information upon adoption. The new lease guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, but will not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities and related deferred tax balances for operating leases; our accounting for financing leases will remain substantially unchanged. At the transition date, we expect the amounts of the new ROU assets and lease liabilities to be within a range of $450 to $500 . The impact on retained earnings is expected to be immaterial. The adoption of the new lease guidance is not expected to significantly impact our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on hedge accounting. The amendments in this guidance include the elimination of the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges, recognition and presentation of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, recognition and presentation of components excluded from an entity's hedge effectiveness assessment, addition of the ability to elect to perform subsequent effectiveness assessments qualitatively, and addition of new disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for us in 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting comprehensive income. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2019. We elected not to adopt this optional reclassification. In June 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment awards. The guidance will make the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees la rgely consistent with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. The guidance is effective for us in 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit 62 pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance is effective for us in 2021. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent Events We have evaluated events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date through our filing date and noted no events that are subject to recognition or disclosure. (2) Acquisitions and Disposals From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $51.8 , $45.7 and $60.5 , respectively. The 2018 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $9.1 and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 , of which $ 18.6 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. The 2017 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $32.7 and contingent consideration related to previous acquisitions of $13.0 , of which $10.3 was related to our 2015 acquisition of 7S Group GmbH (""7S"") in Germany. The 2016 balance includes initial acquisition payments of $57.6 and contingent consideration payments of $2.9 . As of December 31, 2018 , goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisitions were $6.1 and $0.7 , respectively. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the 2017 acquisitions were $35.0 and $13.3 , respectively, the majority of which took place in India and Hong Kong. On April 26, 2017, the sellers of 7S formally disputed the contingent consideration related to the acquisition and are claiming an additional $23.9 ( €20.8 ), plus interest. T he dispute has been heard by an arbitration tribunal in Germany, which is expected to render its decision during 2019. We have vigorously defended these claims in the arbitration, and we believe no further amounts are due. We are not currently able to predict the outcome of the arbitration, and consequently, no amounts have been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on statement of cash flows. The guidance provides classification requirements for certain cash receipts and cash payments. In 2018, we classified $24.1 of payments which were in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date as operating cash flows. The excess cash payments for contingent consideration liabilities made during in 2017 and 2016 were not material. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations in order to optimize our global strategic positioning and synergies. In December 2018, we sold one of our business units in the Netherlands for an after tax net gain of $3.8 and divested a majority interest in a fully consolidated entity in China for an immaterial gain. (3) Revenue Recognition Adoption of New Accounting Guidance on Revenue Recognition As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on revenue recognition using the modified retrospective approach applied to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with previous accounting guidance. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption as there were no significant revenue recognition differences identified between the new and previous accounting guidance. 63 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues when control of the promised services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of any sales, value added, or other taxes collected from our clients. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service to the client, and it is the unit of account in the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in our contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. However, we have multiple performance obligations within our Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) contracts as discussed below. For performance obligations that we satisfy over time, revenues are recognized by consistently applying a method of measuring progress toward satisfaction of that performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time (e.g., hours, weeks, months) of service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of each performance obligation. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices included in the client contracts, using expected costs plus margin, or other observable prices. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Certain client contracts have variable consideration, including credits, sales allowances, rebates or other similar items that generally reduce the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration using whichever method, either the expected value method or most likely amount method, better predicts the amount of consideration to which we will become entitled based on the terms of the client contract and historical evidence. These amounts may be constrained and are only included in revenues to the extent we do not expect a significant reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our variable consideration amounts are not material, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates. Our client contracts generally include standard payment terms acceptable in each of the countries and territories in which we operate. The payment terms vary by the type and location of our clients and services offered. Client payments are typically due approximately 60 days after invoicing, but may be a shorter or longer term depending on the contract. Our client contracts are generally short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. The timing between satisfaction of the performance obligation, invoicing and payment is not significant. For certain services and client types, we may require payment prior to delivery of services to the client, for which deferred revenue is recorded. Principal vs. Agent In certain scenarios where a third-party vendor is involved in our revenue transactions with our clients, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent in the transaction. In situations where we act as principal in the transaction, we control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as gross revenues and cost of services. When we act as agent in the transaction, we do not control the performance obligation prior to transfer to the client, and we report the related amounts as revenues on a net basis. A majority of these agent transactions occur within our TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) programs where our performance obligation is to manage our client’s contingent workforce, and we earn a commission based on the amount of staffing services that are managed through the program. We are the agent in these transactions as we do not control the third-party providers' staffing services provided to the client through our MSP program prior to those services being transferred to the client. Practical Expedients and Exemptions For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. As allowed under the new guidance, we do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to December 31, 2018 related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. 64 Revenue Service Types The following is a description of our revenue service types, including Staffing and Interim, Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting, Permanent Recruitment and Other services. Staffing and Interim Staffing and Interim services include the augmentation of clients’ workforce with our contingent employees performing services under the client’s supervision, which provides our clients with a source of flexible labor. Staffing and Interim client contracts are generally short-term in nature, and we generally enter into contracts that include only a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time based on a fixed amount for each hour of Staffing and Interim service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting Our Outcome-Based Solutions and Consulting services include utilizing consultants and contingent employees who are generally experts in a specific field advising the client to help find strategic solutions to specific matters or achieve a particular outcome. Our services may also include managing certain processes and functions within the client’s organization. We recognize revenues over time based on (i) our clients benefiting from our services as we are providing them, (ii) our clients controlling an asset as it is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance not creating an asset with an alternative use and having an enforceable right to payment for the services we have provided to date. We generally utilize an input measure of time for the service provided, which most accurately depicts the progress toward completion of these performance obligations. The price as specified in our client contracts is generally considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. Permanent Recruitment Permanent Recruitment services include providing qualified candidates to our clients to hire on a permanent basis. We recognize revenues for our Permanent Recruitment services at a point in time when we place the qualified candidate, because we have determined that control of the performance obligation has transferred to the client (i.e., service performed) as we have the right to payment for our service and the client has accepted our service of providing a qualified candidate to fill a permanent position. Revenues recognized from our Permanent Recruitment services are based upon either a fixed fee per placement or as a percentage of the candidate’s salary. Our RPO services are also included in our Permanent Recruitment revenues. RPO services include the various activities of managing a client's permanent workforce, which can include candidate assessments, screening, conducting candidate interviews, providing sourcing technology, and providing our marketing and recruiting expertise. We perform these activities to fulfill the overall obligation to provide permanent workforce management services, so they are not individually distinct and, therefore, we account for them as a single performance obligation. We generally utilize an input measure of time in months, but we do have a few contracts for which we use labor hours of management services provided as this more accurately depicts the progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of management services provided, as each month of management services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of management services as we provide them. We consider the RPO management services and placement services to be distinct and, therefore, separate performance obligations within our RPO contracts as (i) our clients can benefit from each service on its own, and (ii) each service is separately identifiable within the client contract. The prices as specified in our contracts will generally be broken out between management fees and placement fees, which we consider the standalone selling price of each service as they are the observable inputs which depict the prices as if they were sold to a similar client in similar circumstances. The consideration from our client contracts is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. 65 Other Services Other services include revenues from outplacement services, MSP services, training services and franchise fees. • Outplacement services include assisting our clients in managing their workforce transitions and their employees in managing career changes by developing additional skills and finding new employment. We recognize revenues over time as we provide the service (i.e., transfer control of the performance obligation) using the input measure of hours of service to measure progress toward completion of the performance obligation. • MSP services include overall program management of our clients’ contingent workforce and generally include various activities such as reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution, depending on each client contract. We provide these services to fulfill the overall obligation of contingent workforce management services so the individual activities are not distinct and therefore we account for them as a single performance obligation. We recognize revenues over time for each month of MSP services provided, as each month of MSP services is distinct and the client benefits from each month of MSP services as we provide them. • Training services include teaching skills that relate to specific competencies in order for our client’s workforce to acquire knowledge and develop skills proficiencies. We recognize revenues over time for each hour of training service provided as our clients benefit from our services as we provide them. • Our franchise fees include the performance obligation of providing the right to use our intellectual property in a specifically defined exclusive territory as defined in a franchise agreement. Our franchise agreements generally state that franchise fees are calculated based on a percentage of revenues earned by the franchise operations and are payable on a monthly basis. As such, we record franchise fee revenues monthly over time calculated based on the specific fee percentage and the monthly revenues of the franchise operations. Franchise fees were $24.1 , $23.7 and $23.3 for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Disaggregation of Revenues In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types and timing of revenue recognition, and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenues by reportable segment.

Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $42.8 at December 31, 2018 and $48.0 at December 31, 2017. We recognized the entire amount of the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2017 as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. (4) Share-Based Compensation Plans During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we recognized $27.8 , $28.7 and $27.1 , respectively, in share-based compensation expense related to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units, all of which is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Consideration received from share-based awards for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $5.2 , $44.2 and $19.7 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized related to share-based compensation during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $4.5 , $23.7 and $7.4 , respectively. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each award. 67 Stock Options All share-based compensation is granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of Manpower Inc. (“2011 Plan”). Options and stock appreciation rights are granted at a price not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Generally, options are granted with a ratable vesting period of up to four years and expire ten years from date of grant.

The total fair value of options vested during the same periods was $3.1 , $2.3 and $2.5 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , total unrecognized compensation cost was approximately $3.6 , net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Average risk-free interest rate 2.6 % 2.0 % 1.4 % Expected dividend yield 1.6 % 2.0 % 2.1 % Expected volatility 27.0 % 31.0 % 33.0 % Expected term (years) 6.0 6.0 6.0 The average risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility (weighted 75% ) of our stock price over the past five years and implied volatility (weighted 25% ) based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We believe that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than considering purely historical volatility. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option granted during the year was $31.46 , $25.58 and $19.68 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Deferred Stock Our non-employee directors may elect to receive deferred stock in lieu of part or all of their annual cash retainer otherwise payable to them. The number of shares of deferred stock is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the terms and conditions adopted under the 2011 Plan; the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock according to these terms and conditions. During December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , there were 5,551 , 3,647 and 3,714 , respectively, shares of deferred stock awarded under this arrangement, all of which are vested. Non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of deferred stock (or restricted stock, if they so elect) as additional compensation for board service. The award vests in equal quarterly installments over one year and the vested portion of the deferred stock is settled in shares of common stock either upon a director’s termination of service or three years after the date of grant (which may in most cases be extended at the directors’ election) in accordance with the terms and conditions under the 2011 Plan. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , there were 10,152 , 9,857 and 8,388 , respectively, shares of deferred stock and 6,345 , 9,792 and 9,966 , respectively, shares of restricted stock granted under this arrangement, all of which are vested except for 1,666 shares of restricted stock granted in 2018 that were cancelled. We recognized expense of $1.9 , $1.4 and $1.1 related to deferred stock in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to certain employees and to non-employee directors who may elect to receive restricted stock rather than deferred stock as described above. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging up to six years, and in some cases upon retirement. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 69 A summary of restricted stock activity is as follows: Shares (000) Wtd. Avg. Price Per Share Wtd. Avg. Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Unvested, January 1, 2016 405 $64 1.3 Granted 232 75 Vested (172 ) 62 Forfeited (14 ) 76 Unvested, December 31, 2016 451 $70 1.4 Granted 167 $98 Vested (133 ) 79 Forfeited (37 ) 80 Unvested, December 31, 2017 448 $77 1.2 Granted 145 $119 Vested (174 ) 77 Forfeited (23 ) 89 Unvested, December 31, 2018 396 $92 1.3 $26 During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we recognized $13.3 , $12.3 and $13.8 , respectively, of expense related to restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2018 , there was approximately $15.2 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years . Performance Share Units Our 2011 Plan allows us to grant performance share units. We grant performance share units typically with a performance period of three years. Vesting of units occurs at the end of the performance period or after a subsequent holding period, except in the case of termination of employment where the units are forfeited immediately. Upon retirement, a prorated number of units vest depending on the period worked from the grant date to retirement date or in certain cases all of the units vest. In the case of death or disability, the units immediately vest at the Target Award level if the death or disability date is during the performance period, or at the level determined by the performance criteria met during the performance period if the death or disability occurs during the subsequent holding period. The units are settled in shares of our common stock. A payout multiple is applied to the units awarded based on the performance criteria determined by the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. In the event the performance criteria exceeds the Target Award level, an additional number of shares, up to the Outstanding Award level, may be granted. In the event the performance criteria falls below the Target Award level, a reduced number of shares, as low as the Threshold Award level, may be granted. If the performance criteria falls below the Threshold Award level, no shares will be granted. 70 A summary of the performance share units detail by grant year is as follows: 2015 2016 2017 2018 Grant Date(s) February 11, 2015 February 16, 2016 February 9, 2017 February 15, 2018 Performance Period (years) 2015-2017 2016-2018 2017-2019 2018-2020 Vesting Date February 2018 February 2019 (a) February 2020 (a) February 2021 (a) Payout Levels (in units): Threshold Award 82,298 65,141 57,563 47,003 Target Award 164,595 130,282 115,125 94,005 Outstanding Award 329,190 260,564 230,250 188,010 Shares Issued in 2018 219,519 — — — Payout Achieved Over Performance Period — 123,767 — — (a) 2016, 2017 and 2018 awards are scheduled to vest in February 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, when the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the achievement of the performance criteria. We recognize and adjust compensation expense based on the likelihood of the performance criteria specified in the award being achieved. The compensation expense is recognized over the performance and holding periods and is recorded in selling and administrative expenses. We have recognized total compensation expense of $8.4 , $10.8 and $9.1 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, related to the performance share units. Other Stock Plans Under the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, designated employees meeting certain service requirements may purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions. These shares may be purchased at their fair market value on a monthly basis. The current plan is non-compensatory according to the accounting guidance on share-based payments. We also maintain the Savings Related Share Option Scheme for United Kingdom employees with at least one year of service. The employees are offered the opportunity to obtain an option for a specified number of shares of common stock at not less than 85% of its market value on the day prior to the offer to participate in the plan. Options vest after either three or five years, but may lapse earlier. Funds used to purchase the shares are accumulated through specified payroll deductions over a 60 -month period. We recognized an expense of $0.2 , $0.5 and $0.1 for shares purchased under the plan in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Adoption of New Accounting Guidance on Share-Based Payment Awards As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on share-based payment awards. The guidance clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. Adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 (5) Net Earnings Per Share The calculation of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Net earnings available to common shareholders: $556.7 $545.4 $443.7 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions): Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 64.6 67.1 70.1 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 0.2 0.2 Effect of other share-based awards 0.4 0.6 0.5 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 65.1 67.9 70.8 Net earnings per share - basic $8.62 $8.13 $6.33 Net earnings per share - diluted $8.56 $8.04 $6.27 There were certain share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 , because the their impact was anti-dilutive. No share-based awards were excluded from the calculation for the year ended December 31, 2017. The number, exercise prices and weighted-average remaining life of these antidilutive awards were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Shares (in thousands) 264 — 20 Exercise price $ 109 $ — $ 93 Weighted-average remaining life 1.2 years — 0.4 years (6) Income Taxes On December 22, 2017 , the United States enacted the Tax Act, which made broad changes to the tax code including a reduction of the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as well as a transition to a Territorial Tax regime. Due to the timing and complexity of the Tax Act, we recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for the year ended and as of December 31, 2017. As allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we revised our provisional amounts based on new guidance and additional analysis during a measurement period of one year from the enactment date (""one-year measurement period""). Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. The key provisions of the Tax Act and their related impacts, including the impact during the one-year measurement period, are as follows: • As a result of the Tax Act, the deferred tax liability previously recorded for non-United States earnings that were not permanently invested was reduced with a corresponding benefit to tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $275.8 . This was comprised of the deferred tax liability recorded as of December 22, 2017, offset by $5.5 tax expense related to non-United States withholding tax. During the one-year measurement period, we increased the deferred tax liability by $9.2 due to non-United States withholding and other taxes provided on non-United States prior-year earnings that may be remitted. • As part of the transition to a Territorial Tax regime, a tax was imposed on our unremitted post-1986 non-United States earnings. In 2017, we estimated and recorded a transition tax expense of $170.2 . During the one-year measurement period, the Transition tax recorded was reduced by a net $6.0 during the year ended December 31, 2018. • The impact of the Tax Act on our deferred tax assets and liabilities balance, excluding the provision for unremitted earnings, was a tax expense of $1.2 . This amount remained unchanged during the year ended December 31, 2018. • The Tax Act created a new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax regime. Under GILTI, income earned after December 31, 2017 by certain non-United States subsidiaries may be included currently in the gross income of the United States parent company. We made a policy decision to treat GILTI taxes as a current period expense. 72 The provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Current United States Federal $17.2 $211.7 $35.6 State 10.8 8.4 4.0 Non-United States 181.9 168.6 144.0 Total current 209.9 388.7 183.6 Deferred United States Federal (7.5 ) (178.2 ) 69.7 State 1.0 (0.8 ) 0.5 Non-United States (5.4 ) (17.8 ) 3.8 Total deferred (11.9 ) (196.8 ) 74.0 Total provision $198.0 $191.9 $257.6 A tax reconciliation between taxes computed at the United States federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016 and the consolidated effective tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Income tax based on statutory rate $158.5 $258.1 $245.5 Increase (decrease) resulting from: Non-United States tax rate difference: French business tax (1) 59.1 46.9 41.0 French CICE (2) (39.9 ) (77.1 ) — Other (1)(2) 20.0 (28.6 ) (23.5 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings (2)(3) 2.5 69.7 (10.5 ) State income taxes, net of federal benefit 8.2 1.1 2.2 Change in valuation allowance 0.7 (6.9 ) (6.0 ) Work Opportunity Tax Credit (8.8 ) (10.5 ) (11.0 ) Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction (12.5 ) — — United States Tax Act and French tax reform (3) 3.2 (73.7 ) — Other, net 7.0 12.9 19.9 Tax provision $198.0 $191.9 $257.6 (1) The French business tax is allowed as a deduction for French income tax purposes. The gross amount of the French business tax was $74.8 , $72.1 and $63.1 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amounts in the table above of $59.1 , $46.9 and $41.0 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, represent the French business tax expense net of the French tax benefit using the United States federal rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences are a benefit of $10.1 for 2018 and an expense of $0.4 for both 2017 and 2016 related to the difference between the United States federal rate and the French tax rate applied to the respective gross amounts of the French business tax. (2) The French CICE was a payroll tax credit that was tax-free for French tax purposes and increased French earnings. The amounts in the table above of $39.9 and $77.1 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, represent the French tax benefits using the United States federal rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences are a benefit of $25.5 for 2018 and an expense of $1.3 for 2017 related to the difference between the United States federal rate and French tax rate applied to the respective gross French CICE amounts. The French tax benefits related to the CICE were $58.9 for 2016. Prior to the Tax Act, this increase in French earnings resulted in a United States tax expense as these French earnings were deemed to be not permanently invested, which was included in Repatriation of non-United States earnings. Included in Other Non-United States tax rate differences were benefits of $2.4 and $1.8 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, that related to French earnings that were deemed to be permanently invested. (3) Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, we recorded $83.3 of tax expense in 2017 related to non-United States earnings that were deemed to be not permanently invested. This amount was included in the Repatriation of non-United States earnings consistent with prior years. As a result of the Tax Act, this $83.3 was reversed as we were no longer recording United States federal income tax expense on these earnings, and this tax benefit was included in the United States Tax Act and French tax reform benefit of $73.7 . 73 Deferred income taxes are recorded based on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The Tax Act significantly impacted our deferred income taxes. Temporary differences, which give rise to the deferred taxes, are as follows: December 31 2018 2017 Future Income Tax Benefits (Expense) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance $13.8 $17.3 Employee compensation payable 17.8 20.2 Pension and postretirement benefits 46.9 49.0 Intangible assets (102.1 ) (103.0 ) Repatriation of non-United States earnings (15.3 ) (5.5 ) Loans denominated in foreign currencies (19.6 ) (13.5 ) Net operating losses 100.5 104.1 Other 97.4 77.6 Valuation allowance (72.4 ) (77.5 ) Total future tax benefits $67.0 $68.7 Deferred tax asset $99.3 $101.0 Deferred tax liability (32.3 ) (32.3 ) Total future tax benefits $67.0 $68.7 Pre-tax earnings of non-United States operations were $551.0 , $514.9 and $482.2 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on $292.5 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested. As of December 31, 2018, deferred taxes for non-United States withholding and other taxes were provided on $1,729.3 of unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries that may be remitted to the United States. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $15.3 and $5.5 , respectively, related to these non-United States earnings that may be remitted. We had United States federal and non-United States net operating loss carryforwards and United States state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $410.1 and $174.6 , respectively, as of December 31, 2018 . The net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: United States Federal and Non-United States United States State 2019 $6.1 $3.9 2020 3.1 0.2 2021 5.3 3.7 2022 4.5 4.0 2023 1.9 9.6 Thereafter 22.2 153.2 No expirations 367.0 — Total net operating loss carryforwards $410.1 $174.6 We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $100.5 as of December 31, 2018 , for the benefit of these net operating losses. Realization of this asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards. A related valuation allowance of $66.3 was recorded as of December 31, 2018 , as management believed that realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is unlikely. 74 As of December 31, 2018 , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $34.2 that would favorably affect the effective tax rate if recognized. During 2018, we settled non-United States tax litigation unfavorably, resulting in a reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits of $42.4 with minimal impact to the tax provision. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next year. As of December 31, 2017 , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $66.5 . We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. In 2018, we recognized a reduction of interest and penalties due to the aforementioned tax litigation of $18.4 . We accrued net interest and penalties of $0.2 and $0.3 in 2017 and in 2016 , respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : 2018 2017 2016 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $46.1 $23.8 $19.0 Increases in prior year tax positions 11.4 27.1 4.1 Decreases in prior year tax positions (1.8 ) (1.2 ) (1.7 ) Increases for current year tax positions 5.9 6.6 4.1 Expiration of statute of limitations and audit settlements (29.4 ) (10.2 ) (1.7 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $32.2 $46.1 $23.8 Potential interest and penalties 2.0 20.4 20.2 Balance, end of year $34.2 $66.5 $44.0 We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2011 through 2018 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2018 , we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 75 (7) Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate (3) Total (4) Balance, January 1, 2017 $ 516.4 $ 97.0 $ 421.9 $ 77.0 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,239.9 Goodwill acquired — 10.0 0.1 24.9 — — 35.0 Currency impact and other 2.8 14.9 46.1 4.3 — — 68.1 Balance, December 31, 2017 519.2 121.9 468.1 106.2 62.1 65.5 1,343.0 Goodwill acquired 4.6 — — 1.5 — — 6.1 Goodwill allocated to business units sold — — (8.8 ) — — — (8.8 ) Currency impact and other (3.9 ) (9.7 ) (23.9 ) (5.7 ) — — (43.2 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 519.9 $ 112.2 $ 435.4 $ 102.0 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,297.1 (1) Balances related to United States were $476.5 as of January 1, 2017 , December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 .

Balances related to Italy were $4.4 , $5.0 and $4.8 as of January 1, 2017 , December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance as of December 31, 2018 relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisition of Jefferson Wells ( $55.5 ) which is part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See the table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. (4) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $513.4 as of January 1, 2017 , December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 . Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: December 31 2018 2017 United States $532.0 $532.0 Germany 129.2 135.4 Netherlands 112.0 126.5 United Kingdom 93.7 89.2 France 68.9 76.3 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Other reporting units 299.2 321.5 Total goodwill $1,297.1 $1,343.0 (8) Debt Information concerning short-term borrowings is as follows: December 31 2018 2017 Short-term borrowings $49.9 $49.1 Weighted-average interest rates 8.4 % 7.9 % We maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2018 , such uncommitted credit lines totaled $319.9 , of which $269.1 was unused. Under our revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 in the third quarter of each year. 76 A summary of long-term debt is as follows: December 31 2018 2017 Euro-denominated notes: €500 due June 2026 $567.8 $— €400 due September 2022 456.8 477.8 €350 due June 2018 — 420.0 Other 0.9 0.6 1,025.5 898.4 Less - current maturities 0.2 420.3 Long-term debt $1,025.3 $478.1 Euro Notes On June 22, 2018, we offered and sold €500.0 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.750% notes due June, 2026 (the “ €500.0 notes”). The net proceeds from t he €500.0 notes of €495.7 were used to repay our €350.0 notes due June 22, 2018, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases. The €500.0 notes were issued at a price of 99.564% to yield an effective interest rate of 1.809% . Interest on the €500.0 notes is payable in arrears on June 22 of each year. The €500.0 notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €400.0 aggregate principal amount 1.875% notes (the "" €400.0 notes"") are due September, 2022 . When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 r evolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 notes or the €400.0 notes. Both the €500.0 notes and €400.0 notes contain certain customary non-financial restrictive covenants and events of default and are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. A portion of these notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018. For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, since our net investment in these subsidiaries exceeds the respective amount of the designated borrowings, the related translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) Revolving Credit Agreement On June 18, 2018, we amended and restated our Five Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, principally to revise the termination date of the facility from September 16, 2020 to June 18, 2023. The remaining material terms and conditions of the Agreement are substantially similar to the previous agreement. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowing of $600.0 in various currencies, and up to $150.0 may be used for the issuance of stand-by letters of credit. We had no borrowings under this facility as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $0.5 and $0.8 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Additional borrowings of $599.5 and $599.2 were available to us under the facility as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 12.5 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 100.0 basis points on any borrowings. 77 The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgments, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. Debt Maturities The maturities of long-term debt payable within each of the four years subsequent to December 31, 2019 are as follows: 2020 — $0.2 , 2021 — $0.0 , 2022 — $457.3 , 2023 — $0.0 . (9) Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans For all of our United States defined benefit and retiree health care plans, we adopted the Society of Actuaries’ RP-2006 mortality table with MP-2018 projection scale in determining the plans’ benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (""net benefit cost""). The new guidance requires bifurcation of net benefit cost, which used to be reported as an employee cost within operating income under the old guidance. The service cost component is still presented with other employee compensation cost in operating income or capitalized in assets in rare circumstances. The other components are now reported separately outside of operations, and are not eligible for capitalization. We have reclassified the prior year non-service cost components of net benefit cost to interest and other expenses from selling and administrative expenses to conform to the current period presentation. The non-service cost component was a net cost of $2.8 and $1.0 and a net credit of $5.3 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pensi on plans covering permanent employees. During 2016, we transitioned an additional German plan associated with the employees who were transferred in as part of a new client contract. The unfunded portion of this plan was $56.4 and $61.8 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which will be partially funded by the client at the end of the contract. We have received a bank guarantee to cover the counterparty risk associated with this unfunded amount. 78 The reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans are as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $53.7 $53.1 $489.5 $416.0 Service cost — — 10.9 10.1 Interest cost 1.6 1.7 10.0 8.9 Transfers — — 1.2 9.3 Actuarial (gain) loss (2.0 ) 3.0 (28.0 ) 1.0 Plan participant contributions — — 0.2 0.2 Benefits paid (4.4 ) (4.1 ) (10.5 ) (9.5 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — (23.3 ) 53.5 Benefit obligation, end of year $48.9 $53.7 $450.0 $489.5 United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $38.7 $37.3 $376.7 $324.5 Actual return on plan assets (0.7 ) 3.0 (2.4 ) 13.4 Transfers — — (0.3 ) 1.8 Plan participant contributions — — 0.2 0.2 Company contributions 2.5 2.5 9.2 7.9 Benefits paid (4.4 ) (4.1 ) (10.5 ) (9.5 ) Currency exchange rate changes — — (18.8 ) 38.4 Fair value of plan assets, end of year $36.1 $38.7 $354.1 $376.7 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year ($12.8 ) ($15.0 ) ($95.9 ) ($112.8 ) Amounts Recognized Noncurrent assets $15.0 $15.3 $46.9 $36.8 Current liabilities (2.5 ) (2.5 ) (0.5 ) (0.4 ) Noncurrent liabilities (25.3 ) (27.8 ) (142.3 ) (149.2 ) Net amount recognized ($12.8 ) ($15.0 ) ($95.9 ) ($112.8 ) Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consisted of: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net loss $13.7 $13.9 $16.5 $29.9 Prior service cost — — 7.7 6.7 Total $13.7 $13.9 $24.2 $36.6 79 The accumulated benefit obligation for our plans that have plan assets was $390.4 and $433.0 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2018 2017 Accumulated benefit obligation $129.4 $135.9 Plan assets 67.0 65.5 The projected benefit obligation for some of our plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets as follows: December 31 2018 2017 Projected benefit obligation $135.8 $143.8 Plan assets 67.0 65.5 By their nature, certain of our plans do not have plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for these plans was $86.0 and $86.7 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The components of the net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for all plans were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost $10.9 $10.1 $8.0 Interest cost 11.6 10.6 11.8 Expected return on assets (10.6 ) (10.8 ) (10.9 ) Curtailment and settlement — — (6.9 ) Net loss 1.4 0.9 1.0 Prior service cost 0.6 0.4 0.4 Net periodic benefit cost 13.9 11.2 3.4 Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligation Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net (gain) loss (16.6 ) (1.5 ) 24.7 Prior service cost 1.4 2.9 — Amortization of net loss (1.4 ) (0.9 ) (1.0 ) Amortization of prior service cost (0.6 ) (0.4 ) (0.4 ) Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss (17.2 ) 0.1 23.3 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss ($3.3 ) $11.3 $26.7 Effective July 1, 2016, we terminated a defined benefit plan in Northern Europe and transitioned our employees to a defined contribution plan, resulting in a curtailment and settlement gain of 6.9 . The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2019 are $1.2 and $0.7 , respectively. 80 The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the benefit obligation were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Discount rate 4.2 % 3.6 % 2.4 % 2.1 % Rate of compensation increase 3.0 % 3.0 % 1.8 % 1.9 % The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Discount rate - service cost 3.6 % 4.1 % 4.4 % 2.1 % 2.2 % 3.2 % Discount rate - interest cost 3.2 % 3.3 % 3.4 % 2.1 % 2.2 % 3.2 % Expected long-term return on plan assets 4.5 % 4.8 % 5.3 % 2.7 % 2.8 % 3.4 % Rate of compensation increase 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 2.2 % We determine our assumption for the discount rate based on an index of high-quality corporate bond yields and matched-funding yield curve analysis as of the end of each fiscal year. Our overall expected long-term rate of return used in the measurement of the 2018 net periodic benefit cost on United States plan assets was 4.5% , while the rates of return on our non-United States plans varied by country and ranged from 1.5% to 3.5% . For a majority of our plans, a building block approach has been employed to establish this return. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income instruments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. We also use guaranteed insurance contracts for four of our foreign plans. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected rate of return. Projected salary levels utilized in the determination of the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans are based upon historical experience and the future expectations for each respective country. Our plans’ investment policies are to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Our long-term objective is to minimize plan expenses and contributions by outperforming plan liabilities. We have historically used a balanced portfolio strategy based primarily on a target allocation of equity securities and fixed-income instruments, which vary by location. These target allocations, which are similar to the 2018 allocations, are determined based on the favorable risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted within a specified range to advance our overall objective. The fair values of our pension plan assets are primarily determined by using market quotes and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, except for the insurance contracts, which are measured at the present value of expected future benefit payments primarily using the Deutsche National Bank interest curve. 81 The fair value of our pension plan assets by asset category was as follows: United States Plans Non-United States Plans Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset Category Cash and cash equivalents (1) $5.1 $— $5.1 $— $35.5 $35.5 $— $— Equity securities: United States companies 6.3 6.3 — — 16.6 16.6 — — International companies — — — — 13.9 13.9 — — Fixed income securities: Government bonds (2) 18.4 — 18.4 — 55.5 — 55.5 — Corporate bonds 6.3 — 6.3 — 43.9 — 43.9 — Annuity contract — — — — 46.2 — — 46.2 Guaranteed insurance contracts — — — — 17.7 — 17.7 — Bank loans — — — — 8.9 — 8.9 — Other types of investments: Real estate funds — — — — 8.2 — 8.2 — Insurance contracts — — — — 107.7 — — 107.7 $36.1 $6.3 $29.8 $— $354.1 $66.0 $134.2 $153.9 (1) This category includes a prime obligations money market portfolio.

(3)This category includes investments in approximately 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income securities and 10% cash. The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the pension assets that are measured using Level 3 inputs. We determined that transfers between fair-value-measurement levels occurred on the date of the event that caused the transfer. Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 Balance, beginning of year $108.8 $126.2 Transfers 46.2 (25.4 ) Actual return on plan assets 4.2 (5.3 ) Purchases, sales and settlements, net (0.3 ) (0.6 ) Currency exchange rate changes (5.0 ) 13.9 Balance, end of year $153.9 $108.8 83 Retiree Health Care Plan We provide medical and dental benefits to certain eligible retired employees in the United States. Due to the nature of the plan, there are no plan assets. The reconciliation of the changes in the plan’s benefit obligation and the statement of the funded status of the plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $14.9 $15.6 Interest cost 0.5 0.6 Actuarial gain (0.5 ) (0.3 ) Benefits paid (1.2 ) (1.0 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $13.7 $14.9 Funded Status at End of Year Funded status, end of year ($13.7 ) ($14.9 ) Amounts Recognized Current liabilities ($1.1 ) ($1.2 ) Noncurrent liabilities (12.6 ) (13.7 ) Net amount recognized ($13.7 ) ($14.9 ) The amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consists of a net loss of $0.9 and $1.4 for 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and a prior service credit of $4.1 and $4.8 in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of the benefit obligation was 4.2% and 3.5% in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The discount rate used in the measurement of net periodic benefit cost was 3.2% , 4.0% and 4.3% in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss for this plan were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Net Periodic Benefit Credit Interest cost $0.5 $0.6 $0.7 Net loss 0.1 0.1 0.1 Prior service credit (0.8 ) (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Net periodic benefit credit ($0.2 ) ($0.1 ) $— Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/Loss Net (gain) loss ($0.5 ) ($0.3 ) $0.2 Amortization of net loss (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Amortization of prior service credit 0.8 0.8 0.8 Total recognized in other comprehensive income/loss 0.2 0.4 0.9 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income/loss $— $0.3 $0.9 The estimated prior service credit for the retiree health care plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2019 is $0.8 . 84 The health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 7.3% for 2019 , decreasing gradually to an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2025 . Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: 1% Increase 1% Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components $— $— Effect on benefit obligation 0.3 (0.3 ) Future Contributions and Payments During 2019 , we plan to contribute approximately $7.8 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Projected benefit payments from the plans as of December 31, 2018 were estimated as follows: Year Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2019 $12.3 $1.1 2020 13.2 1.1 2021 15.3 1.1 2022 16.0 1.1 2023 17.9 1.1 2024–2028 117.4 4.9 Total projected benefit payments $192.1 $10.4 Defined Contribution Plans and Deferred Compensation Plans We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all permanent United States employees and various other employees throughout the world. With our company-sponsored plans, employees may elect to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans and we match a portion of their contributions up to a maximum percentage of the employee’s salary. In addition, profit sharing contributions are made if a targeted earnings level is reached. The total expense for our match and any profit sharing contributions was $17.7 , $17.6 and $21.4 for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In certain countries with statutory defined contribution plans, we pay a percentage of the employees' salary in pension premiums. The total expense for the statutory defined contribution plans was $37.4 , $35.6 and $24.0 for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We also have deferred compensation plans in the United States. One of the plans had an asset and liability of $88.5 and $98.0 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, with the remaining plans holding immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities. 85 (10) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: December 31 2018 2017 Foreign currency translation $ (223.2 ) $ (87.7 ) Translation loss on net investment hedge, net of income taxes of $(12.9) and $(23.1), respectively (4.7 ) (39.9 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans (137.2 ) (128.8 ) Unrealized gain on investments, net of income taxes of $0.0 and $3.4, respectively — 15.3 Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $(23.2) and $(27.8), respectively (37.9 ) (50.5 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $2.0 for both 2018 and 2017 3.2 3.4 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (399.8 ) $ (288.2 ) As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. Upon adoption, we reclassified $15.3 , the cumulative unrealized gain on our Swiss franchise's investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. Going forward, we will recognize the changes in fair value on the investment portfolio in the current period earnings as opposed to other comprehensive loss. (11) Leases We lease property and equipment primarily under operating leases. Renewal options exist for substantially all leases. Future undiscounted minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under noncancelable operating leases with any remaining terms consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018 : Year 2019 $151.4 2020 115.2 2021 85.5 2022 65.0 2023 44.1 Thereafter 105.6 Total minimum lease payments $566.8 Rental expense for all operating leases was $175.8 , $173.1 and $166.5 for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 86 (12) Interest and Other Expenses Interest and other expenses consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Interest expense $47.0 $49.4 $49.5 Interest income (6.0 ) (4.8 ) (3.6 ) Foreign exchange loss 1.4 0.8 2.8 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (0.4 ) 6.5 (4.5 ) Interest and other expenses $42.0 $51.9 $44.2 As of January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (""net benefit cost""). Under the new guidance, we are required to present non-service cost components of net benefit cost in interest and other expenses, as opposed to selling and administrative expenses. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) (13) Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed through the use of derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. In accordance with the current accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, we record all of our derivative instruments as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management A portion of the €400.0 Notes ( $456.8 ) and €500.0 ( $567.8 ) Notes was designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018 . For this portion of the Euro-denominated notes, the gain or loss associated with foreign currency translation is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had an unrealized loss of $0.5 and $35.7 , respectively, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, as the net investment hedge was deemed effective. On occasion, forward contracts are designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. We had a translation loss of $4.2 as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 , included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, as the net investment hedge was deemed effective. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in the current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. We recorded a $2.2 gain, no gain or loss, and a loss of $1.6 for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, associated with our forward contracts in interest and other expenses. The fair value measurements of these items recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 87 (14) Contingencies Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company is named as a defendant in various legal proceedings in which claims are asserted against the Company. We record accruals for loss contingencies based on the circumstances of each claim, when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition. On April 26, 2017, the sellers of 7S, a company we acquired in 2015, formally disputed the contingent consideration related to the acquisition and are claiming an additional $23.9 ( €20.8 ), plus interest. The dispute has been heard by an arbitration tribunal in Germany, which is expected to render its decision during 2019. We have vigorously defended these claims in the arbitration, and we believe no further amounts are due. We are not currently able to predict the outcome of the arbitration, and consequently, no amounts have been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees We have entered into certain guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit that total $190.3 ( $139.0 for guarantees and $51.3 for stand-by letters of credit) as of December 31, 2018 . The guarantees primarily relate to operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit relate to insurance requirements and debt facilities. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. (15) Segment Data We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis, with Right Management currently operating as a separate global business unit. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. We develop and implement global workforce solutions for our clients that deliver the outcomes that help them achieve their business strategy. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; APME; and Right Management. The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from the placement of contingent workers. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from other workforce solutions and services, including ManpowerGroup Solutions (Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP), Proservia and Talent Based Outsourcing (TBO)), recruitment and assessment, and training and development. The Right Management segment revenues are derived from career management and talent management services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, which is included herein. Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During 2018, we implemented internal controls to ensure we have adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate the adoption on January 1, 2018. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting upon adoption of the new standard. During 2018, we implemented internal controls to 94 ensure we have adequately evaluated our lease portfolio and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to leases on our financial statements to facilitate the adoption on January 1, 2019. We do not expect significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard. Item 9B. Other Information Not applicable. 95 PART III Item 10.

As of the end of fiscal 2023, we employed 1,416 people in our technology, engineering, and product design functions in the United States, China, Taiwan, Japan, Israel, the United Kingdom, India, Germany, Poland, and Korea. Intellectual Property Rights Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other statutory and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may provide only limited protection. As of June 2023, we held 2,583 active patents and 569 pending patent applications worldwide that expire between 2023 and 2043. Collectively, these patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our key technologies, including those 9 for touch sensing, voice processing, secure biometrics, display drivers, touch and display integration, docks and adapters, video interfaces, wired and wireless connectivity, audio processing, video processing, edge computing, open AI tools, and computer vision. Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are also protected by copyright laws and applicable trade secret laws. Our extensive array of technologies includes those related to ICs, firmware, software, and mechanical hardware. Our products rely on a combination of these technologies, making it difficult to use any single technology as the basis for replicating our products. Furthermore, the lengths of our customers’ design cycles and the customizations required within the products we provide to our customers also serve to protect our intellectual property rights. Customers Our customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMs, automotive manufacturers and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost-effectiveness, and on-time deliveries have resulted in our leadership position in providing human experience semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions which are focused in several of our target markets, will continue to position us as a source of supply for their product offerings. We generally supply our products to OEMs through their contract manufacturers, supply chain or distributors. We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human experience semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions. Sales and Marketing We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we employed 399 sales and marketing professionals. We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the U.S., Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Japan, United Kingdom and Switzerland. In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors that are primarily located in the U.S., China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Germany. International sales constituted nearly all of our revenue for each of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. Approximately 63%, 66% and 68% of our sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were made to companies located in China and Taiwan that provide design and manufacturing services for major IoT, notebook computer, and mobile product applications OEMs. Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 15 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Manufacturing We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom module products or processed as our ASIC-based solution. After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom product solutions or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products. 10 We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment. Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. In some cases, we have alternative sources of suppliers to mitigate supplier risk; however, in the current environment, all of them could be constrained. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any single source of supply. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand substantially declines.

RI SK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. Risks Related to Our Markets and Customers We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of our products into any of these markets would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in any of these markets, or a slowdown of growth in any of these markets because of changes in customer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer. A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to one direct customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2023, we had five OEM customers that integrated our products into their products representing approximately 37% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, and business. We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult. We face risks related to recessions, inflation, stagflation and other macroeconomic conditions Customer demand for our products may be impacted by weak macroeconomic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recessionary or lower-growth environments, rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions or reduce their use of our services. In addition, these economic conditions could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges from our manufacturing partners if we need to slow production to reduce inventory levels. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession, our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges, and as a result they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customer demands or collect revenue or otherwise harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our manufacturing partners, customers, suppliers and creditors and might prevent us from accessing preferred sources of liquidity, and causing our borrowing costs to potentially increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions, conditions in the semiconductor industry, or conditions in our customer end markets continue to deteriorate or experience a sustained period of weakness or slower growth, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to risk from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components and supplies, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our manufacturing partners or suppliers to manufacture our end products. These components and supplies have, from time-to-time, become restricted. Additionally, general market factors and conditions have in the past, and may in the future, affect pricing of such components and supplies (such as inflation or supply 16 chain constraints). See also, “Our gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or for other reasons.” We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results. The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, production overcapacity, and increased inventory and credit risk. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy. We cannot assure you that our product solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets. Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets. Various target markets for our product solutions, such as IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future. If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers’ products that utilize our solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline. We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our solutions. Instead, we design various solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers’ products that incorporate our solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales could decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our solutions. We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers and expand our relationships with OEMs in new markets. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue. In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities in the markets in which we operate, particularly in the IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets. 17 Our gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or other reasons. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In addition, our more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production expenses. Therefore, over time, we may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins. Our financial results could suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by other cost reductions through efficiencies, introduction of higher margin products and other means. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer certain price concessions to certain customers, which could cause our average selling prices and gross margins to decline. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or by our competitors and other factors. We expect to continue to have to reduce prices of existing products in the future. Moreover, because of the wide price differences across the markets we serve, the mix and types of performance capabilities of our products sold may affect the average selling prices of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin. We may enter new markets in which a significant amount of competition exists, and this may require us to sell our products with lower gross margins than we earn in our established businesses. If we are successful in growing revenue in these markets, our overall gross margin may decline. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result may harm our financial results. Additionally, because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly, testing or packaging facilities, we are not able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase, which could also reduce our gross margins. Our gross margin could also be impacted, for example, by the following factors: increased costs (including increased costs caused by tariffs, inflation, higher interest rates, or supply chain constraints); loss of cost savings if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either our manufacturers partners or our suppliers deteriorates; excess inventory, or inventory holding and obsolescence charges. In addition, we are subject to risks from fluctuating market prices of certain components, which are incorporated into our products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our products. Supplies of these components may from time-to-time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions such as inflation or supply chain constraints have in the past affected and may in the future affect pricing of such commodities. Any increase in the price of components used in our products will adversely affect our gross margins. We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Some of our customers have, and others may in the future, cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. In addition, customers who have purchase commitments may not honor those commitments. Due to their inability to predict demand or other reasons during our fiscal 2023, some of our customers have accumulated excess inventories and, as a consequence, they either have deferred or they may defer future purchases of our products. We cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. We place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. For example, our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by the delays inherent in our customer’s product development processes, which may include extensive qualification and testing of components included in their products, including ours. In many cases, they design their products to use components from multiple suppliers. This creates the risk that our customers may decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our semiconductor solutions prior to completion, which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand. In addition, while many of our customers are subject to purchase orders or other agreements that do not allow for cancellation, there can be no assurance that these customers will honor these contract terms and cancellation of these orders may adversely affect our business operations and demand forecast which is the basis for us to have products made. 18 Our products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, which creates supply chain cross-dependencies. Due to cross dependencies, supply chain disruptions have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact the demand for our products. We have a limited ability to predict the timing of a supply chain correction. If we cannot predict future customer demand or supply chain disruptions, then we may hold excess or obsolete inventory. Moreover, significant supply chain disruption may negatively impact the timing of our product shipments and revenue shipment linearity, which may impact and extend our cash conversion cycle. In addition, the market share of our customers could be adversely impacted on a long-term basis due to any continued supply chain disruption, which could negatively affect our results of operations. If we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. The risk of obsolescence and/or excess inventory is heightened for semiconductor solutions due to the rapidly changing market for these types of products. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders, or the return of previously sold products, could materially and adversely affect our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations. Risks Related to Our Supply Chain We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results. We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in Asia. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. In our fiscal 2022, we faced manufacturing capacity constraints as a result of the supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry that materially limited our ability to meet our customers’ demand forecasts, thereby limiting our potential revenue growth during the fiscal year. As a result of the supply shortages, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with certain of our suppliers. If end customer demand declines, these long-term capacity agreements could result in significant write-downs of inventory. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to enable us to meet our customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results. 19 Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue. Risks Related to Product Development We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue. We provide solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of solutions for our OEMs’ products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer’s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer’s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue. We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the markets in which we operate, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the markets in which we operate, and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins. Some of our competitors have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer. We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we may be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential solutions. Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not 20 to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results. We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following: Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth. If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue. We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. We handle product quality matters sustainably by working on a one-on-one basis with our customers. We have never formally recalled a product or had a mass defect that affected an entire product line. Nevertheless, manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts. We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results. From time-to-time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. 21 Risks Related to International Sales and Operations Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export, and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier, or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the U.S. and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China’s overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue, and operating results. International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in Taiwan, China, and Korea by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.K. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following: 22 If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2023, approximately 13% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including British pounds, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, Polish zloty, Israeli New Shekel, and Swiss francs. If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Risks Related to Our Employees We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel. Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the U.S., could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan. If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial 23 advantage. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the U.S. We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products. We may pursue, and from time-to-time defend, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third-party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third-party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology. In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. Any breach or violation of the terms and conditions specified in these license agreements could have significant adverse consequences on our operations and financial performance and may result in legal action, monetary penalties, or the termination of the license, which would impact our ability to offer certain products or services . If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third-party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Risks Related to Acquisitions Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We 24 may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses. We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following: We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business. Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth. We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets. We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company. In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant Systems, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the “Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state, and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the 25 implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Risks Factors Related to Our Indebtedness Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, our 4.000% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time-to-time. On March 11, 2021, we completed the offering of the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, with a corresponding amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, or as amended and supplemented, the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Senior Notes include a mandatory semi-annual payment of a 4.000% coupon. We are permitted under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Senior Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. The covenants in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; and (x) engage in a new line of business. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more 26 difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. General Risk Factors If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer. The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to: In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the IoT market, the PC applications market, and the mobile product applications market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design, or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer. 27 We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, ransomware, and other attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows. We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. We collect, use, and store personally identifiable information, or PII, as part of our business and operations. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of PII. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. The theft, loss or misuse of PII collected, used, stored or transferred by us, our any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and discourage a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with “interested stockholders.” Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third-party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors 28 to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third-party’s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time-to-time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 29 For further information regarding current legal proceedings, see Note 10, Indemnifications and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. ITEM 4. MINE SAF ETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED ST OCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information on Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol ""SYNA"" since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. Stockholders As of August 11, 2023, there were approximately 115 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 11, 2023 was $89.20. Dividends We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make our debt payments, or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results, and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes also place restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes indenture, see Note 8 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Stock-Based Compensation For information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities From April 2005 through April 2023, our Board of Directors cumulatively authorized the repurchase of up to $2.3 billion for our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which expires in July 2025. As of the end of fiscal 2023, the remaining amount authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program was $893.9 million. During the three-month period ended June 24, 2023, repurchases under the stock repurchase program were as follows: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program March 26, 2023 - April 22, 2023 — — — — April 23, 2023 - May 20, 2023 — — — — May 21, 2023 - June 24, 2023 998,942 $ 83.50 998,942 $ 893,922,447 Total 998,942 30 Performance Graph The following line graph compares cumulative total stockholder returns for the five years ended June 24, 2023 for (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index and (iii) the Russell 2000 Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2018. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index include reinvestment of dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period. The historical performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

The performance graph above will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of our company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. ITEM 6. RESERVED 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Impact of COVID-19 Many of the restrictions and other containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back. We did not incur significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 pandemic and our business was not severely impacted. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Most of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We also generate revenue from license-based arrangements. We license the rights to certain of our intellectual properties to customers granting them the right to manufacture and sell licensed products. For fiscal 2023, revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 70.0% of our net revenue, revenue from the PC product applications market accounted for 16.0% of our net revenue, and revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 14.0% of our net revenue. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. 32 Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes, Term Loan Facility and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Acquisitions Broadcom In February 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain GPS developed technology intangible assets from Broadcom for an aggregate consideration of $30.0 million, which was paid in cash in the previous fiscal year. Emza On October 2022, we completed the acquisition of Emza Visual Sense, Ltd., or Emza, for total purchase consideration of $15.8 million. Emza is a developer of ultra-low-power artificial intelligence visual sensing solutions. Emza's technology extends our position in Edge AI and allows us to serve the personal computing market with a solution for human presence detection, or HPD. For further discussion of the Emza acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 33 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset, valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity’s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity’s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty, and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Rights to our intellectual property, or IP, are either sold or licensed to customers. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occurs, or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. 34 Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations within Other Accrued Liabilities as disclosed in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. We invoice customers and recognize all of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Inventory Valuation We state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of a business acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially recorded at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable intangible asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. The valuation of intangible assets requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach that includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and 35 discount rates. We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on the provisions of enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Taxes payable on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, inclusions in the U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred. Evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all positive and negative evidence available, including recent earnings history and taxable income in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Using available evidence and judgment, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against state research and development credits and certain capital losses of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact our tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs. As a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, tax incentives, the availability of tax credits and loss carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, which includes our estimates of the fair value of our intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings and tax audits. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of audits could be materially different than the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, results of operations, and cash flows. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate. We are subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if these positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in recognition or measurement with respect to our uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with complex tax laws. We believe we have adequately provided for in our financial statements additional taxes that we estimate to be required as a result of such examinations. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Any unpaid tax liabilities, including the interest and penalties, are released pursuant to a final settlement with tax authorities, completion of audit or expiration of various statutes of limitation. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities throughout the world include Japan, India, Hong Kong, Israel and the United States. The recognition and measurement of income taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities require that we make certain estimates and judgments. Changes to these estimates or judgments may have a material effect on our income tax provision in a future period. Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within two reporting units: IoT, and Mobile/PC. 36 We perform our goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses various financial data and ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, projected growth rates of our reporting units in the near and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment for the current year indicated that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. Trends and Uncertainties Current Economic Conditions The impact of rising rates over the course of the past 18 months has had a material impact on many sectors of the economy leading to broad-based workforce reductions, a slowing or deferral of investment in information technology spending, and increased concern of a global recession. We believe the threat of global recession is the primary driver for the slowdown in orders from our customer base that we have experienced. During fiscal 2023, we experienced a broad reduction in demand in most of our product applications as many customers and channel partners continue to consume their accumulation of inventories, combined with customer requests to delay orders. Inflation in the costs of goods and services has not had a material impact on our results of operations, but rising inflation could increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income. Further, rising interest rates have increased our borrowing costs on our variable rate Term Loan Facility, which will continue to drive an increase in interest costs in future accounting periods and potentially limit our borrowing capacity if a future acquisition opportunity requiring financing presents itself. 37 Results of Operations The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2023 and 2022 along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages): 2023 2022 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 946.3 $ 1,100.9 $ (154.6 ) (14.0 %) PC product applications 217.3 343.0 (125.7 ) (36.6 %) Mobile product applications 191.5 295.8 (104.3 ) (35.3 %) Net revenue 1,355.1 1,739.7 (384.6 ) (22.1 %) Gross margin 715.9 943.1 (227.2 ) (24.1 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 351.2 367.3 (16.1 ) (4.4 %) Selling, general, and administrative 175.0 168.4 6.6 3.9 % Acquired intangibles amortization 35.4 38.7 (3.3 ) (8.5 %) Restructuring costs - 18.3 (18.3 ) (100.0 %) Operating income 154.3 350.4 (196.1 ) (56.0 %) Interest and other income, net 27.2 3.0 24.2 806.7 % Interest expense (55.5 ) (30.2 ) (25.3 ) 83.8 % Loss on extinguishment of debt - (8.1 ) 8.1 (100.0 %) Gain from sale and leaseback transaction - 5.4 (5.4 ) (100.0 %) Income before provision for income taxes 126.0 320.5 (194.5 ) (60.7 %) Provision for income taxes 52.4 64.6 (12.2 ) (18.9 %) Equity investment loss - 1.6 (1.6 ) (100.0 %) Net income $ 73.6 $ 257.5 $ (183.9 ) (71.4 %) The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Percentage Point Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) IoT product applications 69.8 % 63.3 % 6.5 % PC product applications 16.0 % 19.7 % (3.7 %) Mobile product applications 14.2 % 17.0 % (2.8 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 52.8 % 54.2 % (1.4 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 25.9 % 21.1 % 4.8 % Selling, general, and administrative 12.9 % 9.7 % 3.2 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.6 % 2.2 % 0.4 % Restructuring costs 0.0 % 1.1 % (1.1 %) Operating income 11.4 % 20.1 % (8.7 %) Interest and other income, net 2.0 % 0.2 % 1.8 % Interest expense (4.1 %) (1.7 %) (2.4 %) Loss on extinguishment of debt 0.0 % (0.5 %) 0.5 % Gain from sale and leaseback transaction 0.0 % 0.3 % (0.3 %) Income before provision for income taxes 9.3 % 18.4 % (9.1 %) Provision for income taxes 3.9 % 3.7 % 0.2 % Equity investment loss 0.0 % 0.1 % (0.1 %) Net income 5.4 % 14.8 % (9.4 %) 38 Fiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $1,355.1 million for fiscal 2023 compared with $1,739.7 for fiscal 2022, a decrease of $384.6 million, or 22.1%. Of our fiscal 2023 net revenue, $946.3 million, or 69.8%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market, $217.3 million, or 16.0%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $191.5 million, or 14.2%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market. The overall decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2023 was due to demand and inventory corrections in our market areas resulting in a decrease in revenues in all our product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications decreased $154.6 million, or 14.0%, net revenue from PC product applications decreased $125.7 million, or 36.6%, and net revenue from mobile product applications decreased $104.3 million, or 35.3%. The decrease in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by a 11.6% decrease in the units sold as well as a 2.7% decrease in average selling prices. The decrease in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by a 38.3% decrease in the units sold, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in average selling prices. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a 29.3% decrease in the units sold as well as a 8.4% decrease in average selling prices. The overall decrease in our revenues in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is the result of a broad reduction in demand in most of our product applications as many customers and channel partners continued to consume their accumulation of inventories, combined with customer requests to delay orders and downward pressure on product pricing. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 52.8%, or $715.9 million, for fiscal 2023 compared with 54.2%, or $943.1 million, for fiscal 2022. The 140 basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in units sold as well as an overall decline in average selling prices in all our product applications. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $16.1 million, to $351.2 million, for fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $21.8 million decrease in variable compensation and a $17.0 million decrease in share-based compensation costs primarily related to our phantom stock awards. The final vesting of our phantom stock awards occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and there are no phantom stock awards outstanding. Total compensation costs associated with our phantom stock awards for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $0.3 million and $27.2 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in payroll related costs of $17.8 million as a result of increases in headcount and an increase of $3.9 million in new product development activities. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $6.6 million, to $175.0 million, for fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a net increase of $6.8 million in share-based compensation costs. The net increase in share-based compensation was a combination of increases in share-based compensation from equity awards granted during fiscal 2023, partially offset by decreases in phantom stock and performance-based stock awards year over year. Payroll related costs increased $4.1 million as a result of increases in headcount. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was partially offset by a decrease of $11.2 million in variable compensation costs. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 7 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 39 Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations, improve efficiencies in our operational activities and gain synergies from acquisitions. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. There were no restructuring costs incurred during fiscal 2023. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2022 were $18.3 million. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Non-Operating Income. Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net increased $24.2 million, to $27.2 million for fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. The increase is due to higher interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest Expense. Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs increased $25.3 million to $55.5 million during fiscal 2023 as compared to $30.2 million during fiscal 2022. Interest expense on the $600 million incremental Term Loan Facility increased by $26.0 million during fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago, as the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility increased by approximately 340 basis points period-over-period. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility was funded in December 2021 and included approximately seven months of interest expense during fiscal 2022. The interest expense on the Term Loan Facility during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $36.2 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Loss on redemption of convertible notes . Loss on redemption of convertible notes represents the difference between fair value and the carrying value as of the redemption date of the convertible notes. The loss on redemption of convertible notes for fiscal 2022 was $8.1 million. Gain from sale and leaseback transaction . Gain from sale and leaseback transaction represents the gain from the sale of our headquarters buildings and properties located San Jose, California in fiscal 2022. The gain from the sale and leaseback transaction for fiscal 2022 was $5.4 million. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $52.4 million and $64.6 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. See “Note 14 Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 22, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $924.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2023 compared with $824.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2022, an increase of $100.7 million. The increase primarily reflected cash flows provided by operating activities of $331.5 million, offset by $221.3 million of cash used by financing activities. We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2023, $824.4 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we will be able to repatriate these funds without any further impact on our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2023, the $331.5 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $73.6 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $130.4 million, share-based compensation costs of $122.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $27.4 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $1.5 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $23.4 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $161.3 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily related to a decrease in sales, a decrease of $24.6 million in inventories as we continued our efforts to control inventory spend while turning over the inventories we accumulated during the first half of fiscal 2023, a decrease of $95.6 million in accounts payable due to timing of payments and a decrease of $45.4 in accrued compensation primarily related to decreases in our annual bonus accrual. Our days sales outstanding was 65 days in fiscal 2023 as compared to 61 days in fiscal 2022. Our inventory turns decreased to three times in fiscal 2023 from four times in fiscal 2022. 40 For fiscal 2022, the $462.7 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $257.5 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $123.5 million, share-based compensation costs of $100.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $24.0 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $24.2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $18.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to an $81.1 million increase in accounts receivable, an increase of $54.2 million in inventories, an increase of $23.2 million in accounts payable, an increase of $48.6 million in income taxes payable and an increase of $17.4 million in other accrued liabilities. Our days sales outstanding was 61 days in fiscal 2022 as compared to 63 days in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turns decreased to four times in fiscal 2022 from seven times from fiscal 2021. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2023 was $6.0 million and consisted primarily of $15.5 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and $34.2 million used for the purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by $43.6 in proceeds from maturities and sales of our short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 was $482.7 million and consisted primarily of $501.1 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and $31.1 million used for the purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by proceeds from sale and leaseback transaction of $55.9 million and $24.4 million in proceeds from sales of investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2023 was $221.3 million and was primarily attributable to $183.5 million in repurchases of our common stock, $6.0 in debt repayments and $54.5 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, partially offset by $17.6 million in proceeds from issuance of shares. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2022 was $14.3 million and was primarily attributable to $600.0 million in proceeds from issuance of debt and $15.2 million in proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $3.0 million of payment on debt, $67.3 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, and $505.6 million used for payment for redemption of convertible notes. For discussion related to the statement of cash flows for fiscal 2021, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 23, 2021. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of the end of fiscal 2023, our Board of Directors had cumulatively authorized the purchase of up to an aggregate of $2.3 billion of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program through July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2023, we purchased, net of issuances for settlement of our convertible notes, 30,116,439 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $878.0 million. As of the end of fiscal 2023, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $893.9 million. Senior Notes. On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes requires bi-annual interest only payments. In fiscal 2023, we paid interest expense of $16.0 million on the Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility. On March 16, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment to our Credit Agreement, dated March 11, 2021. The Second Amendment replaces the LIBOR-based interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement with SOFR-based interest rate . On July 28, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement, which provides that the consolidated interest coverage ratio financial covenant will only apply if, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, our aggregate cash and cash equivalents are less than $450 million. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 2023, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 41 Term Loan Facility . In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum, plus an applicable margin. For the year-ended June 2023, we repaid $6.0 million of the principal outstanding on the Term Loan Facility. See “Note 8. Debt” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our outstanding debt obligations. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including small tuck-in acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently required to meet our United States working capital and other cash requirements, but should we repatriate a portion of these earnings, we may be required to pay certain previously accrued state and foreign taxes, which would impact our cash flows. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2023 (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,339.0 $ 67.2 $ 133.8 $ 131.9 $ 1,006.1 Leases 62.0 10.3 18.3 13.3 20.1 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 142.7 71.2 71.5 — — Total $ 1,543.7 $ 148.7 $ 223.6 $ 145.2 $ 1,026.2 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $43.7 million. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements. 42 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please see ""Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted” in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include: Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our total net revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 13% of our total costs in each of fiscal years 2023 and 2022. We face the risk that our accounts payable and acquisition-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 12% and 2% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies in June 2023 and June 2022, respectively. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost, and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes by approximately $15.5 million and our net income by approximately $19.3 million for fiscal 2023, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. Interest Rate Risk on Cash, Cash Equivalents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. There have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents subsequent to fiscal 2023. Interest Rate Risk on Debt With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan. See “Note 8. Debt” for further information. A hypothetical increase in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense by approximately $6.0 million. ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 24, 2023, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 44 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework and the satisfactory completion of the remediation actions described below, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 24, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of June 24, 2023, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-2. Remediated Material Weakness A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the quarter ended June 24, 2023, the Company identified a material weakness in internal control related to the identification and monitoring of the sales reporting requirements of a single non-royalty bearing intellectual property license agreement. The material weakness was primarily due to ineffective risk assessment related to identifying and analyzing risks and ineffective information and communication processes related to identifying and assessing the accuracy of the information used in reporting under certain non-royalty bearing intellectual property license agreements. As a result of this lack of controls, an immaterial error in financial reporting was identified. The Company has concluded that the material weakness described above was fully remediated as of June 24, 2023, due to the implementation of specific processes and controls to identify reporting requirements for non-royalty bearing intellectual property license agreements and to monitor the Company’s ongoing compliance with periodic sales reporting in accordance with the terms of such agreements. These controls were tested and determined to be operating effectively as of June 24, 2023. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except for the identified material weakness and remediation described above under the heading “ Remediated Material Weakness ,” there were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 24, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 24, 2023 and June 25, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended June 24, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F- 2 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of inventories As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company held $137.2 million of inventories as of June 24, 2023 which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions. We identified the valuation of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of net realizable value for these inventories. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product improvements or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory. For a selection of inventory items, we assessed the Company’s assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. As part of the procedure, we considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. For a sample of inventory items, we recalculated the required write-downs and compared this to the recorded amounts. Additionally, we tested a sample of returns which resulted from quality related issues of the Company's products during the year and subsequent to period-end to evaluate if additional write-downs were warranted. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.

Our current served markets include Internet of Things, or IoT, personal computer, or PC, and Mobile. We deliver complete chip, firmware and software semiconductor solutions that allow our customers to seamlessly integrate advanced functions into their end products. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will have a 53-week period. The additional week in a 53-week year is added to the first quarter, making such quarter a 14-week period. The fiscal years presented in this report were 52-week periods ended June 24, 2023, June 25, 2022, and June 26, 2021. The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Our cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022 consisted of bank deposits and money market funds with a fair value of $ 924.7 million and $ 824.0 million, respectively. Short-Term Investments We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term based on management’s intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method, and are reflected as other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Some of the factors we consider include, but are not limited to, the following: the length of time and extent a security’s fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security’s issuer, likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value. For our debt instruments, we also evaluate whether we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. Fair Value Measurements We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When F-9 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time-to-time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy, which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity, limits investments to U.S. government treasuries and agency issues, taxable securities, and municipal issued securities with a minimum rating of investment grade by the rating agencies. We sell our products to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services for OEMs, to some OEMs directly, and to distributors. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. The following customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022: 2023 2022 Customer A 10 % 17 % Customer B 20 % 15 % Other Concentrations Our products include certain components that are currently single sourced. We believe other vendors would be able to provide similar components, however, the qualification of such vendors may require additional lead time. In order to mitigate any potential adverse impact from a supply disruption, we strive to maintain an adequate supply of critical single-sourced components. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Rights to our intellectual property, or IP, are either sold or licensed to customers. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occurs, or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. F- 10 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. There was $ 1.3 million of contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 2023, and $ 1.2 million as of June 2022. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 18.7 million and $ 39.8 million, respectively, as of June 2023, and $ 27.3 million and $ 61.3 million, respectively, as of June 2022. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized $ 21.9 million and $ 3.6 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of June 2023 , we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the ASC, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are incurred after the product has been shipped. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 15 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. Advertising Costs Advertising costs, if any, are expensed when incurred. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the credit loss against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends, and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional credit loss allowances may be required. At June 2023 and June 2022, the allowance for credit losses on our trade receivables was $ 5.0 million and $ 6.0 million, respectively. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to our customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor F- 11 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) wafer manufacturers, and the related assembly, package, and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; acquired intangibles amortization; fair value adjustments associated with acquired businesses; inventory write-downs and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, and consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 70.5 $ 92.2 Finished goods 66.7 77.5 $ 137.2 $ 169.7 Inventories are recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis. We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write-up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Foreign Currency The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in our functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. These foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses, resulted in a net loss of $ 2.3 million in fiscal 2023, a net gain of $ 5.6 million in fiscal 2022 and a net loss of $ 1.4 million in fiscal 2021 . Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends and market capitalization, and Company specific events. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that affect the accuracy of our assumptions, estimates and judgments. If we determine that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of each of our goodwill reporting units is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. F- 12 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) We elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test in fiscal 2023 . Based on the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of each year presented, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no goodwill impairment was recognized. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist primarily of intangible assets purchased through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 1 to 6 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the last quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 . Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities As of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 Customer obligations $ 58.5 $ 88.6 Inventory obligations 7.0 14.1 Operating lease liabilities 9.0 7.6 Other 33.9 35.0 $ 108.4 $ 145.3 As of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, other long-term accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 Operating lease liabilities, long-term $ 42.4 $ 51.5 Deferred tax liability 39.1 52.6 Income taxes payable, long-term 38.1 29.1 Other 16.3 19.4 $ 135.9 $ 152.6 F- 13 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Share-Based Compensation We charge the estimated fair value less actual forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire underlying award, which is generally three or four years for our restricted stock units, or RSU, awards, three years for our market stock units, or MSU, awards, three years for our performance stock units, or PSU, awards, and up to one year for shares purchased under our 2019 employee stock purchase plan. We estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, which is generally three years . The Monte Carlo simulation model that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based MSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the grant date and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. As our phantom stock is a cash-settled award, it is recorded as a liability and remeasured each reporting period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in income on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Product Warranty We generally provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing for a period of twelve months to meet the stated functionality as agreed to in each sales arrangement. Products are tested against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time-to-time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties and do not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. We accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience, and for specific items, at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable. Acquisitions In accordance with the guidance for business combinations, we determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. Each business combination is then accounted for by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. We capitalize acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expense acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations. F- 14 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired developed technology and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and impacts our preliminary estimates is recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities, will be charged to earnings. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. Effective March 16, 2023, we transitioned our credit and loan agreements from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and impact, if any, of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities” which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination by providing consistent recognition guidance. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal 2024 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 2. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 73.6 $ 257.5 $ 79.6 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.6 39.0 34.8 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 0.6 1.7 3.5 Shares, diluted 40.2 40.7 38.3 Net income per share: Basic $ 1.86 $ 6.60 $ 2.29 Diluted $ 1.83 $ 6.33 $ 2.08 Diluted net income per share does not include the effect of potential common shares related to certain share-based awards for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Share-based awards 0.7 0.1 — These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the proceeds received, if any, from such share-based awards combined with the average unamortized compensation costs, were greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive. Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include F- 15 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards and convertible notes. 3. Property and Equipment Property and equipment as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions): Life 2023 2022 Computer equipment 3 - 5 years $ 20.1 $ 19.3 Manufacturing equipment 1 - 5 years 105.9 93.3 Furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements 3 - 10 years 43.4 39.6 Capitalized software 3 - 7 years 22.5 24.3 Construction in progress 7.0 9.2 198.9 185.7 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 132.5 ) ( 122.8 ) Property and equipment, net $ 66.4 $ 62.9 Our construction in progress primarily includes machinery and equipment that we expect to place in service in the next 12 months. 4. Acquisitions Asset Acquisition During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain developed technology intangible assets from Broadcom for an aggregate consideration of $ 30.0 million, which was paid in cash in the previous fiscal year. This transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in the finite-lived developed technology intangible asset. As a result, this transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the total purchase consideration was allocated to intangible assets, amortized over an estimated useful life of six years. Emza Visual Sense, Ltd. On October 25, 2022 , we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza Visual Sense, Ltd. , or Emza, a developer of ultra-low-power artificial intelligence visual sensing solutions , for total purchase consideration of $ 15.8 million. The purchase price was attributed to $ 0.3 million cash acquired, $ 8.0 million of intangible assets, $ 9.8 million of goodwill and $ 2.3 million net liabilities assumed. Goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Emza is not deductible for income tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021 , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc., or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG, a leading global provider of voice and wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, for $ 22.00 per share in an all-cash transaction, referred to as the DSPG acquisition. The DSPG acquisition closed on December 2, 2021 , or the DSPG Closing Date, whereupon we obtained voice and wireless technology and product solutions for converged communications. In addition, under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, we provided replacement equity awards to the transferred employees and allocated $ 1.7 million of the replacement equity awards value to consideration transferred. The DSPG acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 25, 2022, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The adjusted purchase price paid for DSPG was $ 543.3 million. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions): F- 16 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Final As Adjusted June 25, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.5 Short-term investments 71.9 Accounts receivable, net 12.9 Inventory 22.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4.0 Property and equipment 5.9 Intangible assets 212.0 Right-of-use lease asset 9.8 Severance pay fund 16.2 Deferred tax asset 6.7 Non-current other assets 2.3 Total identifiable assets acquired 404.8 Accounts payable ( 6.7 ) Other accrued expenses ( 19.8 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.5 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 8.2 ) Accrued severance ( 16.4 ) Deferred tax liability ( 39.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 6.1 ) Total liabilities ( 98.1 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 306.7 Goodwill 236.6 Net assets acquired $ 543.3 There were no measurement period adjustments during fiscal 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 5.2 $ 150.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 4.0 45.0 In process research and development N/A 16.0 Trade names 1.0 1.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 212.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 4 % to 18 %. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of advanced semiconductor telecommunications products for the Internet of Things, or IoT, market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in calendar year 2024. F- 17 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DSPG as of the DSPG Closing Date. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DSPG acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DSPG. The consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 83.8 million of revenue from the DSPG Closing Date through June 2022. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DSPG as we completed the integration of DSPG into our ongoing operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. In fiscal year 2022, we incurred $ 4.4 million in acquisition related costs which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In December 2021, we executed the Term Loan Facility agreement in the amount of $ 600.0 million, the proceeds of which were used to finance the DSPG acquisition and we incurred $ 11.2 million of debt financing costs thereon. As of June 2023 , $ 6.0 million of the Term Loan Facility is included in short-term debt, and $ 585.0 million is included in long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 8 – Debt” for additional information. Supplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited) The supplemental pro forma financial information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisition had been completed on the date indicated, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The following supplemental pro forma information presents the combined results of operations as if DSPG had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 2021. Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income included adjustments for the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, adjustments to record acquired inventories at fair value, transaction and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for fiscal 2022 was an increase to net income of $ 5.9 million and a decrease in net income of $ 86.3 million in fiscal 2021 . The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the periods presented is as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Revenue $ 1,802.6 $ 1,466.0 Net income (loss) $ 263.4 $ ( 6.7 ) 5. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by category at June 2023 and June 2022 (in millions): We use the specific-identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our short-term investments classified as available-for-sale. June 2023 June 2022 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Cash $ 853.9 $ — $ 853.9 $ 811.9 $ — $ 811.9 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 54.4 — 54.4 12.1 — 12.1 Treasury bills 16.4 — 16.4 — — — Total cash and cash equivalents $ 924.7 $ — $ 924.7 $ 824.0 $ — $ 824.0 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 0.2 $ — $ 0.2 $ 2.4 $ — $ 2.4 Corporate debt securities 6.5 ( 0.2 ) 6.3 43.7 ( 1.9 ) 41.8 Municipal bonds 3.1 — 3.1 7.9 ( 0.1 ) 7.8 Total short-term investments $ 9.8 $ ( 0.2 ) $ 9.6 $ 54.0 $ ( 2.0 ) $ 52.0 F- 18 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The following table classifies our short-term investments by contractual maturities ( in millions ): June 2023 June 2022 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 9.8 $ 9.6 $ 21.0 $ 20.4 Due between 1 year to 5 years — — 33.0 31.6 $ 9.8 $ 9.6 $ 54.0 $ 52.0 All available-for-sale securities have been classified as current, based on management's intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. 6. Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value : The fair value of our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets and are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. At the end of June 2023 and 2022, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions): June 2023 June 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 54.4 $ — $ 54.4 $ 12.1 $ — $ 12.1 Treasury bills 16.4 — 16.4 — — — Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit — 0.2 0.2 — 2.4 2.4 Corporate debt securities — 6.3 6.3 — 41.8 41.8 Municipal bonds — 3.1 3.1 — 7.8 7.8 Total assets $ 70.8 $ 9.6 $ 80.4 $ 12.1 $ 52.0 $ 64.1 The above table excludes $ 853.9 million of cash held in our bank accounts. We did not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value during fiscal 2023 and 2022 and there were no transfers in or out of our Level 1 or 2 assets during the same periods. F- 19 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Debt and Term Loan (“Note 8. Debt”). The estimated fair value of the notes was determined based on the trading price of the notes as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the notes to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Debt are as follows for the periods presented (in millions): June 2023 June 2022 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Senior Notes due 2029 $ 395.6 $ 337.2 $ 395.0 $ 326.9 Term Loan due 2028 582.4 $ 575.3 586.7 $ 575.0 $ 978.0 $ 912.5 $ 981.7 $ 901.9 7.

During fiscal 2022 , we retired fully amortized intangible assets of $ 21.5 million of audio and video developed technology, $ 12.0 million in backlog and $ 3.1 million in licensed technology and other. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 130.4 million in fiscal 2023, $ 123.5 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 110.1 million in fiscal 2021. This amortization expense was included in our consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue.

Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Senior Notes Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date . On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all F- 21 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over 99 months . The total interest expense and amortization of the debt issuance costs recorded on the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 2023 and 2022 was $ 16.6 million in each year. Revolving Credit Facility On March 16, 2023, we entered into a Second Amendment, or the Second Amendment, and on July 28, 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment, or the Third Amendment, to our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, dated March 11, 2021. The Second Amendment replaces the LIBOR-based interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement with a SOFR-based interest rate, and the Third Amendment provides that the consolidated interest coverage ratio financial covenant only applies if, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, our aggregate cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $ 450 million. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 2023 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Amended Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement bears interest, at our election, of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the Second Amendment, plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or Adjusted Term SOFR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for Adjusted Term SOFR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. F- 22 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, which after the Third Amendment, only applies if our cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $ 450 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. If our quarter-end cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $ 450.0 million, the interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 as of the date of determination. As of the end of the quarter, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility accrue interest at the SOFR, plus 2.25 %, or at the Base Rate plus 1.25 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to an Adjusted Term SOFR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 %, (ii) the Prime Rate and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00 %. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense and amortization of the debt issuance costs recorded on the Term Loan Facility during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $ 37.9 million and $ 11.2 million, respectively . The following table presents the future principal payments related to our Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility in future fiscal years (in millions): Senior Notes Term Loan Facility Total 2024 $ — $ 6.0 $ 6.0 2025 — 6.0 6.0 2026 — 6.0 6.0 2027 — 6.0 6.0 2028 — 6.0 6.0 Thereafter 400.0 561.0 961.0 $ 400.0 $ 591.0 $ 991.0 As of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, our total debt is presented in our consolidated balance sheet as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Total debt Issuance costs Total debt, net of issuance costs Total debt Issuance costs Total debt, net of issuance costs Current portion of long-term debt $ 6.0 $ — $ 6.0 $ 6.0 $ — $ 6.0 Long-term debt 985.0 ( 13.0 ) 972.0 991.0 ( 15.3 ) 975.7 $ 991.0 ( 13.0 ) $ 978.0 $ 997.0 ( 15.3 ) $ 981.7 F- 23 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this report. 9. Leases Our leases primarily include our headquarters office and worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2034 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years . During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded approximately $ 12.0 million and $ 12.7 million of operating leases expense, respectively. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 49.0 $ 61.2 Operating lease liabilities $ 9.0 $ 7.6 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 42.4 51.5 Total operating lease liabilities $ 51.4 $ 59.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 10.6 $ 12.5 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 7.3 42.5 As of the end of fiscal 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term was 7.38 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 5.15 % . F- 24 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2024 $ 10.3 2025 9.9 2026 8.4 2027 7.4 2028 5.9 Thereafter 20.2 Total future minimum operating lease payments 62.1 Less: interest ( 10.7 ) Total lease liabilities $ 51.4 Sale and Leaseback Transaction On February 8, 2022, we executed a sale and leaseback transaction of our properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California, for a purchase price, net of closing and other expenses payable by us, of $ 55.9 million. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the buyer to lease back the land and properties located at 1109 and 1151 McKay Drive, San Jose, California, for an initial term of 12 years and a renewal option for an additional seven years . The transaction qualified for sale and leaseback and operating lease accounting classification, and we recorded a gain of $ 5.4 million which is recorded in the gain on sale and leaseback transaction line in the consolidated statements of operations. 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Legal proceedings We are subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time-to-time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or statements of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 , we accrued $ 4.0 million in relation to a contractual dispute with a vendor. Contingencies We have in the past and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third-party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. F- 25 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 11. Stockholders’ Equity Preferred Stock We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to establish, from time-to-time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2023 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Shares Reserved for Future Issuance Shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of the end of fiscal 2023 were as follows: Stock options outstanding 3,083 Restricted stock units outstanding 1,304,926 Market stock units outstanding 227,321 Performance stock units outstanding 253,359 Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans 3,994,824 Reserved for future issuance 5,783,513 Treasury Stock Our cumulative authorization of repurchases under our common stock repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2023 was $ 2.3 billion expiring July 2025 . The program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock repurchased under this program is held as treasury stock. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we had $ 893.9 million of common stock remaining to be repurchased under our common stock repurchase program. 12. Share-Based Compensation The purpose of our various share-based compensation plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward high-quality employees, directors, and consultants by enabling such persons to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in our common stock in order to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and our stockholders and to provide such persons with annual and long-term performance incentives to focus their best efforts on the creation of stockholder value. Consequently, we determine whether to grant share-based compensatory awards subsequent to the initial award for our employees and consultants primarily on individual performance. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2010 ESPP. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. F- 26 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 5,288,000 . The 2019 ESPP authorizes us to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in our company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our company. As a result of approval by our stockholders of our amended and restated 2019 Incentive Plan on October 27, 2020, no new awards will be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Share-based compensation awards available for grant or issuance for each plan as of the beginning of the fiscal year, including changes in the balance of awards available for grant for fiscal 2023, were as follows: Awards 2019 2019 Available 2019 Employee Employee 2010 Under All Incentive Inducement Stock Incentive DSPG Share-Based Compensation Equity Purchase Compensation Replacement Award Award Plans Plan Plan Plan Plan Plan Balance at June 2022 4,449,604 3,379,524 — 1,070,080 — — Additional shares authorized 698,000 698,000 — — — — Transferred between plans — 5,733 — — ( 5,733 ) — Restricted stock units granted ( 808,153 ) ( 808,153 ) — — — — Market stock units granted ( 110,885 ) ( 110,885 ) — — — — Performance stock units granted ( 157,710 ) ( 157,710 ) — — — — Performance stock units performance adjustment 141,565 142,899 ( 1,334 ) — — — Market stock units performance adjustment ( 168,796 ) ( 148,347 ) ( 20,449 ) — — — Purchases under employee stock purchase plan ( 172,044 ) — ( 172,044 ) — — Forfeited 103,689 95,727 — — 5,733 2,229 Plan shares no longer available for new grants 19,554 — 21,783 — — ( 2,229 ) Balance at June 2023 3,994,824 3,096,788 — 898,036 — — Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit for our stock-based awards and our cash settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Stock-based awards Phantom Stock Units Stock-based awards Phantom Stock Units Stock-based awards Phantom Stock Units Cost of revenue $ 4.0 $ — $ 4.0 $ 0.2 $ 3.0 $ 0.4 Research and development 52.4 0.3 42.5 27.2 23.5 21.9 Selling, general, and administrative 65.6 0.3 54.3 4.7 39.6 4.7 Total $ 122.0 $ 0.6 $ 100.8 $ 32.1 $ 66.1 $ 27.0 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 13.2 $ 23.1 $ 15.2 F- 27 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans, including RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, PSUs, and phantom stock units. We do not recognize a tax benefit upon expensing all or a portion of share-based awards granted to certain executive officers and certain foreign-based employees. We compare the actual tax benefit associated with the tax deduction from share-based award activity to the hypothetical tax benefit based on the grant date fair values of the corresponding share-based awards. Tax benefit associated with excess tax deduction creditable to our income tax provision is recognized when incurred. Tax deficiency associated with a tax deduction shortfall is debited to our income tax provision when incurred. Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding stock option awards include our 2010 Incentive Plan. Under our 2010 Incentive Plan, we were able to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock at not less than 100 % of the fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant. We ceased granting stock options in fiscal 2018. Options granted under our 2010 Incentive Plan generally vest three to four years from the vesting commencement date and expire seven years after the date of grant if not exercised. Certain stock option activity for fiscal 2023 and balances as of the end of fiscal 2023 were as follows: Stock Weighted Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (In millions) Balance at June 2022 31,185 $ 61.50 Exercised ( 27,545 ) $ 62.10 Expired ( 557 ) $ 81.88 Balance at June 2023 3,083 $ 52.53 $ 0.1 Exercisable at June 2023 3,083 $ 52.53 $ 0.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2023, or June 23, 2023, of $ 81.16 . Cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Cash received $ 3.3 $ 5.3 $ 23.9 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 1.6 $ 3.6 $ 8.6 There was no unrecognized share-based compensation costs for stock options granted under our various plans. Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. We began granting DSUs in January 2006 and RSUs in 2019. The use of RSUs will cover the meaning of both RSUs and DSUs. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. Delivery of shares under the plans take place on the quarterly vesting dates. At the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. F- 28 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) RSU activity, including RSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2023, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs as of the end of fiscal 2023 were as follows: Average RSU Awards Grant Date Outstanding Fair Value Balance at June 2022 1,220,565 $ 119.83 Granted 808,153 $ 129.14 Vested ( 631,492 ) $ 115.30 Forfeited ( 92,300 ) $ 137.60 Balance at June 2023 1,304,926 $ 126.50 At the end of fiscal 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs expected to vest was $ 105.9 million and the number of RSU awards expected to vest is 1.3 million shares. Our closing stock price of $ 81.16 on the last day of trading in fiscal 2023 was used to calculate the intrinsic value for the RSUs. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost for RSUs granted under our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan was approximately $ 122.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2023, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.84 years. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, provide for the grant of MSU awards, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2023, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 300 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 300 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 80th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25th and 80th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50th percentile equal to 100 % of target. The first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 300 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche, but not less than the third tranche target quantity multiplied by the final payout factor. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25th and 75th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50th percentile equal to 100 % of target. The first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche, but not less than the third tranche target quantity multiplied by the final payout factor. F- 29 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) For outstanding MSU awards granted in fiscal 2020, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or the Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the Index. The payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2023, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of the end of fiscal 2023 were as follows: Weighted Average MSU Awards Grant Date Outstanding Fair Value Balance at June 2022 251,974 $ 138.51 Granted 110,885 $ 179.98 Performance adjustment 168,796 $ — Vested ( 304,334 ) $ 104.04 Balance at June 2023 227,321 $ 235.67 As a result of Synaptics achieving the 80 th percentile relative to the remaining constituents in the Russell 2000 Index, we delivered 200 % of the targeted shares underlying tranche one of the fiscal 2022 MSU grants. As a result of Synaptics achieving the 84 th percentile relative to the remaining constituents in the Russell 2000 Index, we delivered 200 % of the targeted shares underlying tranche two of the fiscal 2021 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 84.53 percentage points for the tranche three performance period, we delivered 200 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2020 MSU grants, less shares issued for the first tranche and second tranche. At the end of fiscal 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs expected to vest was $ 18.5 million and the number of MSU awards expected to vest is 0.2 million shares. Our closing stock price of $ 81.16 on the last day of trading in fiscal 2023 was used to calculate the intrinsic value for the MSUs. The fair value of each MSU granted from our plans for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was estimated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions: 2023 2022 2021 Expected volatility of company 55.22 % 52.61 % 53.62 % Expected volatility of Index 17.9 % - 320.7 % 17.4 % - 581.6 % 19.6 % - 197.6 % Correlation coefficient 0.61 0.53 0.51 Expected life in years 2.87 2.87 2.87 Risk-free interest rate 3.24 % 0.40 % 0.17 % Fair value per award $ 218.15 - $ 438.24 $ 284.43 - $ 342.89 $ 131.34 - $ 175.15 We amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 22.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2023, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.73 years. Performance Stock Units F- 30 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSU awards to our executive officers and other key management team members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which, generally, are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU award. Generally, PSU awards have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of performance relative to predefined performance criteria (for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022 , the performance criteria was based on non-GAAP earnings per share, for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2021 the performance criteria was based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses). For our fiscal 2023 PSU awards, the potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results are greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2023, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of the end of fiscal 2023 were as follows: Weighted Average PSU Awards Grant Date Outstanding Fair Value Balance at June 2022 257,903 $ 101.50 Granted 157,710 $ 119.50 Performance adjustment 128,622 $ — Vested ( 279,438 ) $ 97.40 Forfeited ( 11,438 ) $ 123.12 Balance at June 2023 253,359 $ 125.40 We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the grant date and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. The PSU awards outstanding balance at June 2023 is based on the target grant quantity and does not include any performance adjustment of shares for completed performance periods. At the end of fiscal 2023, the aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs expected to vest was $ 20.6 million and the number of PSU awards expected to vest is 0.2 million shares. Our closing stock price of $ 81.16 on the last day of trading in fiscal 2023 was used to calculate the intrinsic value for the PSUs. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 3.3 million as of June 2023, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.67 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units were cash-settled and entitled the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vested over three years , with an annual F- 31 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. The final vesting occurred on October 31, 2022, and no phantom stock units remain outstanding under this plan. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Weighted Phantom Average Stock Units Grant Date Outstanding Fair Value Balance as of June 2022 176,097 $ 42.11 Paid ( 173,436 ) $ 42.11 Forfeited ( 2,661 ) $ 42.11 Balance as of June 2023 — $ 0.00 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 2019 ESPP allows employees to designate up to 15 % of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lesser of the FMV at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to one year and includes two exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, if the FMV at an exercise date is less than the FMV at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence. Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows (in millions, except shares purchased and weighted average purchase price): 2023 2022 2021 Shares purchased 172,044 138,502 220,389 Weighted average purchase price $ 91.88 $ 97.90 $ 57.00 Cash received $ 15.8 $ 13.6 $ 12.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 2.8 $ 12.5 $ 10.3 The fair value of each award granted under our 2019 ESPP for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per award for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 40.70 , $ 38.93 and $ 20.82 , respectively. Unrecognized share-based compensation costs for awards granted under our 2019 ESPP at the end of fiscal 2023 were approximately $ 6.3 million that will be amortized over the next 8 months . 13. Employee Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for full-time employees in the U.S. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their net compensation up to the annual limit of $ 22,500 or $ 30,000 for employees who are 50 years or older. In fiscal 2023 , we provided matching funds of 25 % of our employees’ contributions, excluding catch-up contributions. The employer matching funds vest immediately. We made matching contributions of $ 1.9 million, $ 1.7 million and $ 1.8 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. 14. Income Taxes Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 United States $ ( 118.2 ) $ ( 44.8 ) $ ( 21.0 ) Foreign 244.2 365.3 141.1 Income before provision for income taxes $ 126.0 $ 320.5 $ 120.1 F- 32 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Current tax expense/(benefit) Federal $ 15.8 $ ( 0.6 ) $ 4.1 State 0.1 — 0.1 Foreign 62.4 94.9 36.1 78.3 94.3 40.3 Deferred tax expense/(benefit) Federal ( 12.7 ) ( 21.8 ) ( 0.5 ) State — — — Foreign ( 13.2 ) ( 7.9 ) ( 8.4 ) ( 25.9 ) ( 29.7 ) ( 8.9 ) Provision for income taxes $ 52.4 $ 64.6 $ 31.4 The provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Provision at U.S. federal statutory tax rate $ 26.4 $ 67.3 $ 25.1 State income taxes — — 0.1 Non-deductible share-based compensation 6.6 7.9 5.2 (Windfall)/shortfall related to share-based compensation ( 1.3 ) ( 18.1 ) ( 3.8 ) Non-deductible officer compensation 6.4 6.4 6.4 Business credits ( 5.2 ) ( 10.0 ) ( 3.8 ) Foreign tax differential ( 0.5 ) 6.4 ( 6.7 ) U.S. inclusion of foreign income 21.0 3.6 5.2 Deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 0.3 0.7 3.5 Other differences ( 1.3 ) 0.4 0.2 Provision for income taxes $ 52.4 $ 64.6 $ 31.4 F- 33 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in “Non-current other assets” and “Other long-term liabilities,” respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Capital loss carryforward $ 34.1 $ 33.8 Inventory write downs 1.9 2.6 Property and equipment and intangible assets 42.1 11.7 Share-based compensation 10.3 12.0 Nondeductible interest 4.9 5.4 Lease liabilities 10.1 11.2 Business credit carryforward 45.1 62.0 Net operating loss carryforward 10.8 16.3 Other accruals 5.1 5.6 164.4 160.6 Valuation allowance ( 78.4 ) ( 75.0 ) 86.0 85.6 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 1.9 ) ( 2.0 ) Right-of-use assets ( 9.5 ) ( 11.5 ) Unremitted foreign earnings ( 14.3 ) ( 22.1 ) Acquisition intangibles ( 31.4 ) ( 45.8 ) ( 57.1 ) ( 81.4 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 28.9 $ 4.2 The fiscal 2022 capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset and its corresponding valuation allowance includes a reclassification adjustment of $ 16.0 million to conform to the current period presentation. This reclassification had no impact on previously reported deferred tax assets. Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2023, a valuation allowance of $ 78.4 million was maintained to reduce deferred tax assets primarily related to state tax credits and capital losses carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2023 was an increase of $ 3.4 million, primarily due to an increase of unrealized deferred tax assets associated with state tax credits. We consider most of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As a result, $ 14.3 million of our deferred tax liability is associated with unremitted foreign earnings, which if remitted would not result in a further provision for income taxes. We continue to indefinitely reinvest $ 200 million on certain accumulated earnings and outside basis differences primarily related to our DSPG acquisition. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, the associated foreign tax credits would be expected to reduce the U.S. income tax liability associated with the foreign distribution or the otherwise taxable transaction. As of our fiscal 2023 , assuming full utilization of the associated foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and outside basis differences would be approximately $ 46 million. As of the end of fiscal 2023 , we had federal, California, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 28.7 million, $ 25.0 million, and $ 49.6 million, respectively. The federal and California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2037 and 2027 , respectively, if not utilized. Most of our foreign net operating losses have no expiration date. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income or income taxes may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership. We had $ 16.4 million and $ 53.4 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2023. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2029 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. F- 34 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, increased by $ 13.9 million from $ 29.8 million in fiscal 2022 to $ 43.7 million in fiscal 2023. Of this amount, $ 33.1 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Beginning balance $ 29.8 $ 22.6 $ 20.1 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions 13.7 7.1 5.5 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions 2.5 5.5 — Decrease due to effective settlement with tax authorities ( 1.1 ) — — Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ( 0.3 ) ( 0.5 ) — Decrease due to statute expiration ( 0.9 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 3.0 ) Ending Balance $ 43.7 $ 29.8 $ 22.6 Accrued interest and penalties inc reased by $ 0.5 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 and increased by $ 0.8 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 . Accrued interest and penalties were $ 3.0 million and $ 2.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2023and 2022, respectively. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $ 1.4 million to an increase of $ 8.8 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to inc ome tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Israel and the U.K. From fiscal 2017 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 15. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product applications market, the personal computing, or PC, product applications market, and the mobile, product applications market.

Subsequent Events In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Avago Technologies International Sales PTE. Limited, or Broadcom, to acquire certain developed technology intangible assets from Broadcom for an aggregate consideration of $ 130.0 million. We are still in the process of evaluating the proper accounting treatment under Topic 805 on Business Combinations. On July 21, 2023, the IRS issued Notice 2023-55 which generally allows taxpayers to defer application of elements of the 2022 foreign tax credit final regulations, and related guidance, until 2024. In our case, foreign taxes which were creditable under the prior regulations will continue to be creditable for our fiscal 2023. As this Notice was issued subsequent to our fiscal 2023 and represents a retroactive change in tax law, we anticipate recording a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 in the amount of approximately $ 12 million.

It uses no moving parts, can be implemented under plastic or glass, and is extremely durable. Our technology can also track one or more fingers in proximity to the touch surface. Our Force Sensing technology senses the direction and magnitude of a force applied to an object. Our electronic circuitry determines the magnitude and direction of an applied force, permits very accurate sensing of tiny changes in capacitance, and minimizes electrical interference from other sources. Our capacitive force sensing technology can be integrated with our position sensing technology. Capacitive Active Pen Technology . This technology allows us to develop a pen that can be used for input on a capacitive touchscreen. As well as generating a signal that allows the touchscreen to track the pen, additional data, such as the pen applied force and pen button states, are also communicated to the touchscreen device. Information can also be communicated from the touchscreen to the pen. Multi-touch Technology. This technology allows us to create capacitive touch products that simultaneously track the presence, position, and other characteristics of multiple objects in contact with or in close proximity to a flat or curved touch surface. It enables, for example, the recognition of multi-finger gestures, the tracking of a stylus position while the user’s palm is also in contact with the touch surface, and the simultaneous interaction of multiple users with the same touch surface. Display Systems and Circuit Technology . This technology enables us to develop optimized human experience semiconductor product solutions with improved compatibility with their application environments. This technology consists of mobile and large format display semiconductor expertise, including the following functional blocks: This technology also enables us to develop advanced products that combine the functions of the display and touch sensing systems to enable highly integrated display and touch functionality with improved performance, thinner form factors, and lower system cost.

Intellectual Property Rights Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other statutory and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may provide only limited protection. As of June 25, 2022, we held 1,584 active patents and 192 pending patent applications worldwide that expire between 2022 and 2042. Collectively, these patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our key technologies, including those for touch sensing, voice processing, secure biometrics, display drivers, touch and display integration, docks and adapters, video interfaces, wired and wireless connectivity, audio processing, video processing, edge computing, open AI tools, and computer vision. Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are also protected by copyright laws and applicable trade secret laws. Our extensive array of technologies includes those related to ICs, firmware, software, and mechanical hardware. Our products rely on a combination of these technologies, making it difficult to use any single technology as the basis for replicating our products. Furthermore, the lengths of our customers’ design cycles and the customizations required within the products we provide to our customers also serve to protect our intellectual property rights. 10 Customers Our customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMs, automotive manufacturers and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost-effectiveness, and on-time deliveries have resulted in our leadership position in providing human experience semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions which are focused in several of our target markets, will continue to position us as a source of supply for their product offerings. Our leading OEM customers in fiscal 2022 included the following: We generally supply our products to OEMs through their co ntract manufacturers, supply chain or distributors. We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human experience semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions. Sales and Marketing We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we employed 228 sales and marketing professionals. We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the U.S., Taiwan, China, India, Korea, and Japan. In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors that are primarily located in the U.S., China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Germany. International sales constituted over 98% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. Approximately 66%, 68%, and 78% of our sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major IoT, notebook computer, and mobile product applications OEMs. Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 11 Manufacturing We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom module products or processed as our ASIC-based solution. After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom product solutions or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products. We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment. Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available. In some cases, we have alternative sources of suppliers to mitigate supplier risk; however, in the current environment, all of them could be constrained. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any single source of supply. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand declines.

RI SK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. Risks Related to Our Markets and Customers We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of our products into any of these markets would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in any of these markets, or a slowdown of growth in any of these markets because of changes in customer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer. A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to two direct customers each accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we had four OEM customers that integrated our products into their products representing approximately 34% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, and business. We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult. We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results. The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, production overcapacity, and increased inventory and credit risk. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy. 16 We cannot assure you that our product solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets. Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets. Various target markets for our product solutions, such as IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future. If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers’ products that utilize our solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline. We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our solutions. Instead, we design various solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers’ products that incorporate our solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales could decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our solutions. We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers and expand our relationships with OEMs in new markets. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue. In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities in the markets in which we operate, particularly in the IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets. Risks Related to Our Supply Chain We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results. We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in Asia. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. In our fiscal 2022, we faced manufacturing capacity constraints as a result of the supply constraints and capacity shortages 17 affecting the global semiconductor industry that materially limited our ability to meet our customers’ demand forecasts, thereby limiting our potential revenue growth during the fiscal year. As a result of the supply shortages, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with certain of our suppliers. If end customer demand declines, these long-term capacity agreements could result in significant write-downs of inventory. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to enable us to meet our customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results. Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Supply shortages in our fiscal 2022 have resulted in increased product costs, not all of which we passed on to our customers. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue. Risks Related to Product Development We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue. We provide solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of solutions for our OEMs’ products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer’s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer’s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue. We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the markets in which we operate, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the markets in which we operate, and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins. 18 Some of our competitors have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer. We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we may be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential solutions. Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results. We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following: Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth. If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue. We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. Synaptics handles product quality matters sustainably by working on a one-on-one basis with our customers. We have never formally recalled a product or had a mass defect that affected an entire product line. Nevertheless, manufacturing errors or product 19 defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts. We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Risks Related to International Sales and Operations Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export, and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier, or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 20 Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the U.S. and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China’s overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue, and operating results. International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in Taiwan, China, and Korea by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.K. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following: If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2022, approximately 13% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including British pounds, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, Polish zloty, Israeli New Shekel, and Swiss francs. 21 If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Risks Related to Our Employees We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel. Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the U.S., could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan. If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the U.S. We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and 22 products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products. We may pursue, and from time to time defend, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third-party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third-party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology. In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third-party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Risks Related to Acquisitions Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses. 23 We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following: We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business. Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth. We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets. We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company. In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant Systems, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the “Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state, and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 24 Risks Factors Related to Our Indebtedness Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, our 4.000% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time. On March 11, 2021, we completed the offering of the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, with a corresponding amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, or as amended and supplemented, the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Senior Notes include a mandatory semi-annual payment of a 4.000% coupon. We are permitted under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Senior Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. The covenants in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; and (x) engage in a new line of business. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more 25 difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. General Risk Factors Our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate could adversely impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers and customers. Any of these public health threats and related consequences could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. COVID-19 has spread rapidly and enveloped most of the world, causing a global public health crisis . In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Governments in affected countries continue to periodically impose travel bans, quarantines, and other emergency public health measures. In response to the virus, national and local governments in numerous countries around the world have implemented substantial lockdown measures. These restrictions, and prevention and mitigation measures, have had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect our future operations. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition, and cash flows. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. Also, some suppliers of materials used in the production of our products may be located in areas more severely or repeatedly impacted by COVID-19 and its variants, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products. In addition, the severe global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 may cause our customers and end-users of our products to suffer significant economic hardship, which could result in decreased demand for our products in the future and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer. The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to: In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the IoT market, the PC applications market, and the mobile product applications market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design, or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer. 26 We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, ransomware, and other attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows. We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. We collect, use, and store personally identifiable information, or PII, as part of our business and operations. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of PII. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. The theft, loss or misuse of PII collected, used, stored or transferred by us, our any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and discourage a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on 27 certain business combination transactions with “interested stockholders.” Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third-party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third-party’s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.

MINE SAF ETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED ST OCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information on Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol ""SYNA"" since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. Stockholders As of August 12, 2022, there were approximately 120 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 12, 2022 was $146.75. Dividends We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make our debt payments, or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results, and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes also place restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes indenture, see Note 8 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Stock-Based Compensation For information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities From April 2005 through July 2021, our Board of Directors cumulatively authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion for our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which expires in July 2025. As of the end of fiscal 2022, the remaining amount authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program was $577.4 million. During fiscal 2022, there were no repurchases under our stock repurchase program. 29 Performance Graph The following line graph compares cumulative total stockholder returns for the five years ended June 25, 2022 for (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index and (iii) the Russell 2000 Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2017. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index include reinvestment of dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period. The historical performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The performance graph above shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. The performance graph above will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of our company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. ITEM 6. RESERVED 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Impact of COVID-19 Although many of these restrictions and other containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 and its variants have resulted in a variety of responses in the many geographic locations in which we do business, from no actions taken to and up to and including the re-imposition of lockdowns and containment measures designed to mitigate or reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority, and a large number of our workforce has been vaccinated. Many of our employees that worked from home at the onset of COVID-19, or during subsequent lockdowns, have returned full-time or on a hybrid basis to our office environment. For those employees that have returned to the office, we continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread and vaccinate large portions of the population. However, if more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, we, our customer, and our suppliers could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. We will continue to evaluate the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to the ongoing pandemic. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. For fiscal 2022, revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 63.3% of our net revenue, revenue from the PC product applications market accounted for 19.7% of our net revenue, and revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 17.0% of our net revenue. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components 31 of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 15 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets. See below under “Divestiture”. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes, Term Loan Facility and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Gain from sale of equity investment relates to our sale of our equity method investment in OXi Technology Ltd. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Acquisitions DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSPG to acquire all of the equity of DSPG for $22.00 per share of common stock. The transaction closed on December 2, 2021, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $543.3 million. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and the Term Loan Facility. The results of DSPG are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from December 3, 2021 through June 25, 2022. For further discussion of the DSPG acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 32 DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 for an aggregate purchase consideration of $444.0 million. For further discussion of the DisplayLink acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/global navigation satellite system, or GNSS, products and business in the IoT market, or the Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $250.0 million in cash that closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. For further discussion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Divestitures In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction, licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third-party to sell the assets of our LCD, Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement for cash consideration of $138.7 million and had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020. The gain on sale of this portion of a product line was $105.1 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset, valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity’s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity’s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance 33 obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty, and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations within Other Accrued Liabilities as disclosed in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. We invoice customers and recognize all of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Inventory We state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 34 Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of a business acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially recorded at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable intangible asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. The valuation of intangible assets requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach that includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates. We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. 35 Results of Operations The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2022 and 2021 along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages): 2022 2021 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 1,100.9 $ 612.9 $ 488.0 79.6 % PC product applications 343.0 354.7 (11.7 ) (3.3 %) Mobile product applications 295.8 372.0 (76.2 ) (20.5 %) Net revenue 1,739.7 1,339.6 400.1 29.9 % Gross margin 943.1 611.2 331.9 54.3 % Operating expenses: Research and development 367.3 313.4 53.9 17.2 % Selling, general, and administrative 168.4 144.9 23.5 16.2 % Acquired intangibles amortization 38.7 32.7 6 18.3 % Restructuring costs 18.3 7.4 10.9 147.3 % Gain on sale of audio technology assets - (34.2 ) 34.2 (100.0 %) Operating income 350.4 147.0 203.4 138.4 % Interest and other income, net 3.0 2.9 0.1 3.4 % Interest expense (30.2 ) (29.5 ) (0.7 ) 2.4 % Loss on extinguishment of debt (8.1 ) (0.3 ) (7.8 ) 2600.0 % Gain from sale and leaseback transaction 5.4 - 5.4 (100.0 %) Income before provision for income taxes 320.5 120.1 200.4 166.9 % Provision for income taxes 64.6 31.4 33.2 105.7 % Equity investment loss 1.6 (9.1 ) 10.7 (117.6 %) Net income $ 257.5 $ 79.6 $ 177.9 223.5 % The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Percentage Point Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) IoT product applications 63.3 % 45.7 % 17.6 % PC product applications 19.7 % 26.5 % (6.8 %) Mobile product applications 17.0 % 27.8 % (10.8 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 54.2 % 45.6 % 8.6 % Operating expenses: Research and development 21.1 % 23.4 % (2.3 %) Selling, general, and administrative 9.7 % 10.8 % (1.1 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.2 % 2.4 % (0.2 %) Restructuring costs 1.1 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Gain on sale of audio technology assets 0.0 % (2.6 %) 2.6 % Operating income 20.1 % 11.0 % 9.1 % Interest and other income, net 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.0 % Interest expense (1.7 %) (2.2 %) 0.5 % Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.5 %) 0.0 % (0.5 %) Gain from sale and leaseback transaction 0.3 % 0.0 % 0.3 % Income before provision for income taxes 18.4 % 9.0 % 9.4 % Provision for income taxes 3.7 % 2.3 % 1.4 % Equity investment loss 0.1 % (0.7 %) 0.8 % Net income 14.8 % 5.9 % 8.9 % 36 Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $1,739.7 million for fiscal 2022 compared with $1,339.6 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $400.1 million, or 29.9%. Of our fiscal 2022 net revenue, $1,100.9 million, or 63.3% of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market, $343.0 million, or 19.7%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $295.8 million, or 17.0%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market. The overall increase in net revenue for fiscal 2022 was attributable to an increase of $488.0 million, or 79.6%, in net revenue from IoT product applications partially offset by a decrease of $11.7 million, or 3.3%, in net revenue from PC product applications and a decrease of $76.2 million, or 20.5%, in net revenue from mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by a 45% increase in the units sold as well as a 23.9% increase in average selling prices. The decrease in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by a 17.0% decrease in the units sold, partially offset by a 16.4% increase in average selling prices. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a 21.4% decrease in the units sold, partially offset by a 1.2% increase in average selling prices. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 54.2%, or $943.1 million, for fiscal 2022 compared with 45.6%, or $611.2 million, for fiscal 2021. The 860 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable product mix, product cost reductions, and a decrease in inventory fair value adjustments of $13.8 million, partially offset by a $7.5 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization charged to cost of revenue largely related to the acquisition of DSPG. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $53.9 million, to $367.3 million, for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $24.3 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to a substantial increase in our stock price during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, which also increased the share-based compensation associated with our phantom stock plan. Payroll and variable compensation costs increased by $22.6 million, which includes costs associated with research and development headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $23.5 million, to $168.4 million, for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $14.7 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to a substantial increase in our stock price during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, which also increased the share-based compensation associated with our phantom stock plan. Payroll and variable compensation costs increased by $11.1 million, which includes costs associated with selling, general and administrative headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 7 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 37 Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations, improve efficiencies in our operational activities and gain synergies from acquisitions. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2022 and 2021 were $18.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively. See Note 15 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on Sale of Audio Technology Assets. Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio products. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Non-Operating Income. Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net was $3.0 million for fiscal 2022 compared with $2.9 million for fiscal 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $30.2 million and $29.5 million, in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $600 million Term Loan Facility issued in December 2021, interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes issued in March 2021, as well as interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our $525 million principal amount convertible notes issued in June 2017 and settled in August 2021. See Note 8 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Loss on redemption of convertible notes . Loss on redemption of convertible notes represents the difference between fair value and the carrying value as of the redemption date of the convertible notes. The loss on redemption of convertible notes for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was $8.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Gain from sale and leaseback transaction . Gain from sale and leaseback transaction represents the gain from the sale of our headquarters buildings and properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The gain from the sale and leaseback transaction for fiscal 2022 was $5.4 million. Provision for Income Taxes. Our income tax provision was $64.6 million in fiscal 2022 and $31.4 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in our income tax provision in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in foreign profits and associated taxes, offset by the increase in tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation deductions and research and development credits. See “Note 13 Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $0.9 million to an increase of $6.9 million. Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 23, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $824.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 compared with $836.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2021, a decrease of $12.3 million. This decrease reflected cash flows provided by operating activities of $462.7 million and $14.3 million of cash provided by financing activities, offset by $482.7 million of cash used in investing activities. We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2022, $624.0 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we will be able to repatriate these funds without any further impact on our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2022, the $462.7 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $257.5 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles 38 amortization of $123.5 million, share-based compensation costs of $100.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $24.0 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $24.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $19.0 million.

Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of $138.7 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by $16.3 million used for the purchases of capital assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2022 was $14.3 million and for fiscal 2021 was $274.1 million. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to $600.0 million in proceeds from issuance of debt and $15.2 million in proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $3.0 million of payment on debt, $67.3 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, and $505.6 million used for payment for redemption of convertible notes.

Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to $100.0 million proceeds from borrowing under the line-of-credit and $34.5 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $30.2 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market and $9.7 million used for payroll taxes for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. For discussion related to the statement of cash flows for fiscal 2020, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 21, 2020. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of the end of fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors had cumulatively authorized the purchase of up to an aggregate of $1.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program through July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2022, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had $577.4 million, respectively, remaining under our common stock repurchase program. Senior Debt. On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. 39 The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Revolving Credit Facility. On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for 40 working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of the end of fiscal 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility. In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition and general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. 41 $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on COVID-19 variants, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements. While we have accrued taxes on almost all of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would impact our operating cash flows. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2022 (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,282.5 $ 45.5 $ 95.0 $ 94.0 $ 1,048.0 Leases 71.6 6.3 19.5 17.3 28.5 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 247.3 121.4 106.9 19.0 — Total $ 1,601.4 $ 173.2 $ 221.4 $ 130.3 $ 1,076.5 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $29.8 million. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08 “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2021-08 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early 42 application permitted. This ASU is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 25, 2023, and the impact of its adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements will depend on the contract assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations after that date. 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include: Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our total net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 13% of our total costs in each of fiscal 2022 and 2021. We face the risk that our accounts payable and acquisition-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 2% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies at June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost, and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes by approximately $17.4 million and our net income by approximately $24.3 million for fiscal 2022, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. Interest Rate Risk on Cash, Cash Equivalents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. There have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents subsequent to fiscal 2022. Interest Rate Risk on Debt With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan, including changes that may result from implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR. See “Note 8. Debt” for further information. A hypothetical increase in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense by approximately $1.6 million. We currently carry debt that relies on the six-month LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The six-month LIBOR is expected to cease publication after June 30, 2023. To the extent the six-month LIBOR ceases to exist, the Term Loan agreement contemplates an alternative benchmark rate without the need for any amendment thereto. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Reference is made to the financial statements, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, and the notes thereto commencing at page F-1 of this report, which financial statements, report, and notes are incorporated herein by reference. Reference is also made to the quarterly results of operations included elsewhere in this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures Although many of the restrictions and containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, some of our employees continue to work from home, or on a hybrid basis. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. 44 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 25, 2022, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 25, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2022 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-2. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended June 25, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F- 2 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company held $169.7 million of inventories as of June 25, 2022 which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions. Additionally, a liability and a charge are recorded to cost of sales for estimated losses on inventory the Company is obligated to purchase from contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule, cancels its order, or for other factors. We identified the valuation of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of net realizable value for these inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product improvements or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory and recognition of losses related to outstanding inventory purchase obligations. For a selection of inventory items, we assessed the Company’s assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. We also considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. For a sample of inventory items, we recalculated the required write-downs and losses and compared this to the recorded amounts. We confirmed with the Company’s significant vendors regarding outstanding purchase obligations of the Company. Additionally, we tested a sample of returns which resulted from quality related issues of the Company's products during the year and subsequent to period-end to evaluate if additional write-downs or losses were warranted. Evaluation of certain intangible assets acquired through business combinations As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended June 25, 2022, the Company consummated a business combination for total consideration of $543.3 million. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded various intangible assets, which included developed technologies and customer relationships with an acquisition-date fair value of $150.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively. We identified the evaluation of the fair values allocated to acquired developed technologies and certain customer relationship intangible assets as a critical audit matter. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the significant assumptions used to value these acquired intangible assets, individually and in the aggregate. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were sensitive to possible changes to the following key assumptions, requiring a high degree of auditor judgment and the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge: Developed technologies: F- 3 Customer relationship: The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation processes, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions, as listed above. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s projected revenue, technology obsolescence, and estimated customer ramp up periods by comparing them to historical actual results of the acquired entities and certain peer and market participant data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. The fiscal years presented in this report were 52-week periods ended June 25, 2022, June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Our cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of bank deposits and money market funds with a fair value of $ 824.0 million and $ 836.3 million, respectively. Short-Term Investments We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term based on management’s intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method, and are reflected as other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent a security’s fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security’s issuer, likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value. For our debt instruments, we also evaluate whether we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. Fair Value Measurements We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) financial statements approximate the fair value for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy, which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity, limits investments to U.S. government treasuries and agency issues, taxable securities, and municipal issued securities with a minimum rating of investment grade by the rating agencies. We sell our products to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services for OEMs, to some OEMs directly, and to distributors. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. The following customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 Customer A 17 % 15 % Customer B 15 % 12 % Other Concentrations Our products include certain components that are currently single sourced. We believe other vendors would be able to provide similar components, however, the qualification of such vendors may require additional lead time. In order to mitigate any potential adverse impact from a supply disruption, we strive to maintain an adequate supply of critical single-sourced components. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. F- 11 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. In fiscal 2022 , there was no material bad debt charge recorded on accounts receivable. There was $ 1.2 million of contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 25, 2022, and $ 1.9 million as of June 26, 2021. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 27.3 million and $ 61.3 million, respecti vely, as of June 25, 2022 , and $ 7.0 million and $ 36.1 million, respectively, as of June 26, 2021. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recognized $ 3.6 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of June 25, 2022 , we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the ASC, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are incurred after the product has been shipped. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. Advertising Costs Advertising costs, if any, are expensed when incurred. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends, and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional bad debt allowances may be required. For the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 credit losses on our accounts receivable were $ 0.2 million. There were no credit losses on our accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 . We believe that an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to our customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers, and the related assembly, package, and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; acquired intangibles amortization; fair value adjustments associated with acquired businesses; inventory write-downs and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, and consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 92.2 $ 49.1 Finished goods 77.5 32.9 $ 169.7 $ 82.0 F- 12 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write-up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. Other Assets During fiscal 2020, we invested $ 5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a strategic relationship that enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. In April 2017, we paid $ 18.4 million for a 14.4 % interest in OXi Technology Ltd., or OXi. In April 2019, our investment ownership was reduced to 13.8 % as a result of new investment in OXi. We determined the equity method of accounting applied to our investment as we had significant influence over OXi’s operating and financial policies. We recorded our portion of OXi’s net income or net loss on a one quarter lag due to the timing of the availability of OXi’s financial records. We did not have any material related party transactions with OXi. During fiscal 2022, we sold our investment in OXi for $ 5.0 million. In connection with the sale of our investment in OXi, we recorded a gain of $ 2.5 million, offset by our share of OXi's net losses of $ 0.9 million. The net gain of $ 1.6 million is included in Equity investment (gain) loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Foreign Currency The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in our functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. These foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses, resulted in a net gain of $ 5.6 million and $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2022 and 2020, respectively, and a net loss of $ 1.4 million in fiscal 2021 . Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends and market capitalization, and Company specific events. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that affect the accuracy of our assumptions, estimates and judgments. If we determine that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of each of our goodwill reporting units is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. Based on the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of each year presented, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value; as such, our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary and no goodwill impairment was recognized for each period presented. F- 13 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist primarily of intangible assets purchased through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 1 to 6 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the last quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 . Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods if a triggering event occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. F- 14 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities As of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 Customer obligations $ 88.6 $ 43.1 Inventory obligations 14.1 17.0 Operating lease liabilities 7.6 9.3 Other 35.0 26.8 $ 145.3 $ 96.2 As of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, other long-term accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 Income taxes payable, long-term $ 29.1 $ 15.4 Non-current deferred tax liability 52.6 27.1 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 51.5 24.0 Other 19.4 12.0 $ 152.6 $ 78.5 Segment Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of human experience semiconductor solutions for electronic devices and products. The chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is our CEO, Our CODM evaluates financial performance and allocates resources using financial information reported on a company-wide basis. Share-Based Compensation We charge the estimated fair value less actual forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire underlying award, which is generally three or four years for our restricted stock units, or RSU, awards, three years for our market stock units, or MSU, awards, three years for our performance stock units, or PSU, awards, and up to one year for shares purchased under our 2019 employee stock purchase plan . We estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, which is generally three years . The Monte Carlo simulation model that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based MSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the grant date and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. As our phantom stock is a cash-settled award, it is recorded as a liability and remeasured each reporting period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in income on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being F- 15 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Product Warranty We generally provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing for a period of twelve months to meet the stated functionality as agreed to in each sales arrangement. Products are tested against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties and do not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. We accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience, and for specific items, at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable. Business Combinations In accordance with the guidance for business combinations, we determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. Each business combination is then accounted for by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. We capitalize acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expense acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired developed technology and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and impacts our preliminary estimates is recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities, will be charged to earnings. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. F- 16 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 2. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 257.5 $ 79.6 $ 118.8 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.0 34.8 33.6 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 1.7 3.5 1.2 Shares, diluted 40.7 38.3 34.8 Net income per share: Basic $ 6.60 $ 2.29 $ 3.54 Diluted $ 6.33 $ 2.08 $ 3.41 Diluted net income per share does not include the effect of potential common shares related to certain share-based awards for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Share-based awards 0.1 - 0.7 These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the proceeds received, if any, from such share-based awards combined with the average unamortized compensation costs, were greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive. Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, RSUs, MSUs, PSUs and convertible notes. 3. Property and Equipment Property and equipment as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): Life 2022 2021 Land — $ - $ 13.3 Building and building improvements Up to 35 years - 52.7 Computer equipment 3 - 5 years 19.3 22.9 Manufacturing equipment 1 - 5 years 93.3 71.9 Furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements 3 - 10 years 39.6 27.2 Capitalized software 3 - 7 years 24.3 28.1 Construction in progress 9.2 6.1 185.7 222.2 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 122.8 ) ( 131.0 ) Property and equipment, net $ 62.9 $ 91.2 Our construction in progress primarily includes machinery and equipment that we expect to place in service in the next 12 months. 4. Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment Acquisitions DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021 , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc., or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG, a leading global provider of voice and wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, for $ 22.00 per share in an all-cash transaction, referred to as the DSPG acquisition. The DSPG acquisition closed on F- 17 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) December 2, 2021 , or the DSPG Closing Date, whereupon we obtained voice and wireless technology and product solutions for converged communications. In addition, under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, we provided replacement equity awards to the transferred employees and allocated $ 1.7 million of the replacement equity awards value to consideration transferred. The DSPG acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 25, 2022, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The adjusted purchase price paid for DSPG was $ 543.3 million. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions): Final As Adjusted June 25, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.5 Short-term investments 71.9 Accounts receivable, net 12.9 Inventory 22.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4.0 Property and equipment 5.9 Intangible assets 212.0 Right-of-use lease asset 9.8 Severance pay fund 16.2 Deferred tax asset 6.7 Non-current other assets 2.3 Total identifiable assets acquired 404.8 Accounts payable ( 6.7 ) Other accrued expenses ( 19.8 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.5 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 8.2 ) Accrued severance ( 16.4 ) Deferred tax liability ( 39.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 6.1 ) Total liabilities ( 98.1 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 306.7 Goodwill 236.6 Net assets acquired $ 543.3 The following table summarizes the final amounts of the fair values recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for these two acquisitions as of the acquisition date as well as adjustments made during the measurement period: Previously Reported December 25, 2021 Measurement Period Adjustments (1) As Adjusted Other current assets $ 151.9 $ - $ 151.9 Goodwill 256.6 ( 20.0 ) 236.6 Developed technology and other intangible assets 200.5 11.5 212.0 Deferred tax asset 0.3 6.4 6.7 Other long-term assets 35.6 ( 1.4 ) 34.2 Current liabilities ( 26.8 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 28.0 ) Deferred tax liability ( 38.1 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 39.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 29.1 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 30.7 ) Consideration adjustment - 7.6 - Net assets acquired $ 550.9 $ - $ 543.3 F- 18 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (1) The measurement period adjustments were based upon information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized at that date. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 5.2 $ 150.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 4.0 45.0 In process research and development N/A 16.0 Trade names 1.0 1.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 212.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 4 % to 18 %. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of advanced semiconductor telecommunications products for the Internet of Things, or IoT, market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in calendar year 2023. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DSPG as of the DSPG Closing Date. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DSPG acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DSPG. The consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 83.8 million of revenue from the DSPG Closing Date through June 25, 2022. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DSPG as we initiated the integration of a substantial portion of DSPG into our ongoing operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which was completed in the subsequent quarter. Supplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited) The supplemental pro forma financial information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisition had been completed on the date indicated, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The following supplemental pro forma information presents the combined results of operations for the year ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, as if DSPG had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 2021. Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income included adjustments for the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, adjustments to record acquired inventories at fair value, transaction and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for fiscal 2022 was an increase to net income of $ 5.9 million and a decrease in net income of $ 86.3 million in fiscal 2021 . The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the periods presented is as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Revenue $ 1,802.6 $ 1,466.0 Net income (loss) $ 263.4 $ ( 6.7 ) F- 19 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) DisplayLink On July 17, 2020 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 % of equity interest in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology, for $ 305 million in cash adjusted for (i) estimated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the closing (ii) estimated indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the closing, (iii) unpaid portion as of the closing of certain transaction expenses incurred by DisplayLink, and (iv) the amount that the estimated working capital of DisplayLink exceeds or falls short, respectively, of a certain specified target working capital set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with $ 3.1 million of the purchase price held in escrow accounts for adjustments after closing and to secure the Seller Parties’ indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 , or the DisplayLink Closing Date, whereupon we obtained high-performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 26, 2021, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The adjusted purchase price paid for DisplayLink was $ 444.0 million. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.9 Short-term investments 94.0 Accounts receivable, net 7.1 Inventory 33.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 9.1 Property and equipment 6.8 Intangible assets 193.0 Right-of-use lease asset 20.0 Non-current other assets 0.6 Total identifiable assets acquired 404.6 Accounts payable ( 5.2 ) Other accrued liabilities ( 9.1 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 18.2 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 32.8 ) Total liabilities ( 67.0 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 337.6 Goodwill 106.4 Net assets acquired $ 444.0 There were no measurement period adjustments during fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 we recorded measurement period adjustments of $ 0.9 million to goodwill comprising of increases of $ 2.3 million in prepaid expenses and decreases of $ 0.8 million to other accrued liabilities and increases of $ 1.4 million in other long-term liabilities for a net increase of $ 1.7 million to the fair value of other acquired net tangible assets. F- 20 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 3.0 $ 82.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 3.0 54.0 In process research and development N/A 51.0 Trade names 4.0 3.0 Licensed technology 2.5 3.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 193.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 11.0 % to 11.5 %. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of a next generation docking and video interface products for the IoT market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in fiscal 2023. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DisplayLink as of the DisplayLink Closing Date. No ne of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DisplayLink acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DisplayLink. The consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 115.3 million and $ 110.0 million of revenue during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DisplayLink as we integrated a substantial portion of DisplayLink into our ongoing operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 . The following unaudited pro forma financial information (in millions, except per share data) presents the combined results of operations for us and DisplayLink as if the DisplayLink acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2020. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the actual operating results that would have been recorded had the DisplayLink acquisition actually taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2020 and should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated operating results. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma financial results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits from the DisplayLink acquisition. 2021 (1) Revenue $ 1,346.9 Net income $ 72.1 (1) Includes results of Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income included adjustments for historical amortization expense, the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, transaction costs and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for fiscal 2021 was a decrease to net income of $ 1.1 million. Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business On July 2, 2020 , we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $ 250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020 , or the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. We also entered into certain transition F- 21 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years . We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The following table summarizes the adjusted purchase price paid for the Broadcom Business Acquisition (in millions): Cash $ 250.1 Adjustments to consideration transferred, net 1.5 Roadmap products - estimated cost of development ( 25.0 ) $ 226.6 We entered into a derivative and roadmap product agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Broadcom. The derivative and roadmap product agreement includes the purchase of derivative and roadmap product development services to be performed by Broadcom. We estimated the value of the development services to be approximately $ 25.0 million, and accounted for it separate from the business combination. At June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, the net book value of the development services is $ 5.8 million and $ 15.8 million, respectively. The estimated value of the development services is amortizing over the period of time estimated to complete the development or approximately thirty months. The amortization of the estimated cost of development is included in research and development in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees and Broadcom agreed to make cash payments to transferred employees as incentive to accept employment offers from our company. We determined $ 3.5 million of value related to these arrangements should be included as consideration transferred, which was partially offset by $ 2.0 million of cash payments to transferred employees as a reduction of consideration transferred. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Property and equipment $ 1.0 Acquired intangible assets 123.0 Total identifiable assets acquired 124.0 Liabilities assumed ( 0.2 ) Goodwill 102.8 Net assets acquired $ 226.6 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which is 2.2 % for order backlog and 13.0 % for the rest of the intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The following table summarizes the estimate of the intangible assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): F- 22 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 6.0 $ 93.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 6.0 18.0 Order backlog 0.5 12.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 123.0 The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Broadcom Business assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. A ll of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Broadcom Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Broadcom. The consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 228.8 million and $ 100.4 million of revenue during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Broadcom Business Acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition into our ongoing operations at the close. Divestiture In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $ 35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $ 34.2 million. In April 2020, we completed the sale of the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration product line, or TDDI, for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement had a carrying value of approximately $ 33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction for cash consideration of $ 138.7 million. The gain on sale of the assets was $ 105.1 million. 5. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by category at June 25, 2022 (in millions): Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Cash $ 811.9 $ - $ 811.9 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 12.1 - 12.1 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 824.0 $ - $ 824.0 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 2.4 $ - $ 2.4 Corporate debt securities 43.7 ( 1.9 ) 41.8 Municipal bonds 7.9 ( 0.1 ) 7.8 Total short-term investments $ 54.0 $ ( 2.0 ) $ 52.0 We did not hold any short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2021. We use the specific-identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our short-term investments classified as available-for-sale. During fiscal 2022, we did not realize significant gains or losses on a gross level from the sale of our short-term investments classified as available-for-sale. The following table classifies our short-term investments by contractual maturities ( in millions ): F- 23 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Amortized Cost Due within 1 year $ 20.4 Due between 1 year to 5 years 31.6 $ 52.0 All available-for-sale securities have been classified as current, based on management's intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. 6. Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value : The fair value of our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets and are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. At June 25, 2022, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 12.1 $ - $ - $ 12.1 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit - 2.4 - 2.4 Corporate debt securities - 41.8 - 41.8 Municipal bonds - 7.8 - 7.8 $ 12.1 $ 52.0 $ - $ 64.1 The above table excludes $ 811.9 million of cash held in our bank accounts. There were no transfers in or out of our Level 1, 2 or 3 assets during fiscal 2022 or 2021. We did not hold any financial assets measured at fair value during fiscal 2021. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Debt and Term Loan (“Note 8. Debt”). The estimated fair value of the notes was determined based on the trading price of the notes as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the notes to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Debt are as follows for the periods presented (in millions): F- 24 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) June 25, 2022 June 26, 2021 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Senior Notes due 2029 $ 395.0 $ 326.9 $ 400.0 $ 401.5 Term Loan due 2028 586.7 $ 575.0 - - Convertible notes due 2022 - - $ 505.6 $ 1,013.3 $ 981.7 $ 901.9 $ 905.6 $ 1,414.8 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets The following table presents our goodwill balance as of June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 (in millions): 2022 2021 Beginning balance $ 570.0 $ 360.8 Acquisition activity 236.6 209.2 Ending balance $ 806.6 $ 570.0 The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, and the related accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 (in millions): 2022 2021 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.6 $ 232.1 $ ( 109.3 ) $ 122.8 $ 138.6 $ ( 97.6 ) $ 41.0 Customer relationships 4.1 170.5 ( 99.7 ) 70.8 125.5 ( 63.8 ) 61.7 Wireless connectivity technology 5.7 128.0 ( 33.8 ) 94.2 93.0 ( 14.2 ) 78.8 Video interface technology 3.0 82.0 ( 52.4 ) 29.6 82.0 ( 25.1 ) 56.9 Display driver technology 7.0 20.4 ( 20.4 ) — 20.4 ( 17.5 ) 2.9 Backlog Not applicable — — — 12.0 ( 12.0 ) — Licensed technology and other 4.5 9.9 ( 7.5 ) 2.4 13.0 ( 8.1 ) 4.9 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 3.7 ) 0.7 4.4 ( 3.2 ) 1.2 Tradename 4.4 5.8 ( 3.3 ) 2.5 4.8 ( 1.7 ) 3.1 In process research and development Not applicable 67.0 — 67.0 51.0 — 51.0 Acquired intangibles, gross 5.0 $ 720.1 $ ( 330.1 ) $ 390.0 $ 544.7 $ ( 243.2 ) $ 301.5 During fiscal 2022, we retired fully amortized intangible assets of $ 21.5 million of audio and video developed technology, $ 12.0 million in backlog and $ 3.1 million in licensed technology and other. During fiscal 2021, we retired fully amortized intangible assets of $ 143.6 million of display driver developed technology and $ 28.3 million of customer relationships. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 123.5 million in fiscal 2022 , $ 110.1 million in fiscal 2021 , and $ 51.4 million in fiscal 2020. This amortization expense was included in our consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue. The following table presents expected annual aggregate amortization expense in future fiscal years (in millions): 2023 $ 127.5 2024 66.9 2025 60.0 2026 47.0 2027 16.6 Thereafter 5.0 To be determined 67.0 Future amortization $ 390.0 F- 25 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 8. Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Senior Notes Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date . We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Senior Notes Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Senior Notes Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 was $ 16.6 million. F- 26 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of June 25, 2022 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of our company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG F- 27 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25 % or at the base rate plus 1.50 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Term Loan during fiscal 2022 was $ 10.4 million . Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of the our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. 9. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies Leases In fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases. The most significant impact of the adoption of the standard was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Our leases primarily include our headquarters office and worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2034 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years. During fiscal F- 28 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 2022, we recorded approximately $ 12.7 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 61.2 $ 31.7 Operating lease liabilities $ 7.6 $ 9.3 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 51.5 24.0 Total operating lease liabilities $ 59.1 $ 33.3 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 12.5 $ 10.0 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 42.5 21.8 As of the end of fiscal 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term was 8.02 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 4.14 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2023 $ 6.3 2024 10.3 2025 9.2 2026 9.0 2027 8.3 Thereafter 28.5 Total future minimum operating lease payments 71.6 Less: interest ( 12.5 ) Total lease liabilities $ 59.1 We recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis of $ 12.7 million, and $ 10.1 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sale and Leaseback Transaction On February 8, 2022, we executed a sale and leaseback transaction of our properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California, for a purchase price, net of closing and other expenses payable by us, of $ 55.9 million. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the buyer to lease back the land and properties located at 1109 and 1151 McKay Drive, San Jose, California, for an initial term of 12 years and a renewal option for an additional seven years . The transaction qualified for sale and leaseback and operating lease accounting classification, and we recorded a gain of $ 5.4 million which is recorded in the gain on sale and leaseback transaction line in the consolidated statements of operations. F- 29 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Legal proceedings We are subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or statements of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. Contingencies We have in the past and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third-party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. 10. Stockholders’ Equity Preferred Stock We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2022 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Shares Reserved for Future Issuance Shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows: Stock options outstanding 31,185 Restricted stock units outstanding 1,220,573 Market stock units outstanding 251,974 Performance stock units outstanding 441,375 Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans 4,449,604 Reserved for future issuance 6,394,711 F- 30 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Treasury Stock Our cumulative authorization of repurchases under our common stock repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2022 was $ 1.8 billion expiring July 2025 . The program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock repurchased under this program is held as treasury stock. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had $ 577.4 million of common stock remaining to be repurchased under our common stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we issued 3.5 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, from treasury stock for settlement of redemptions of our convertible notes. 11. Share-Based Compensation The purpose of our various share-based compensation plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward high-quality employees, directors, and consultants by enabling such persons to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in our common stock in order to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and our stockholders and to provide such persons with annual and long-term performance incentives to focus their best efforts on the creation of stockholder value. Consequently, we determine whether to grant share-based compensatory awards subsequent to the initial award for our employees and consultants primarily on individual performance. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2010 ESPP. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. F- 31 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 4,590,000 . The 2019 ESPP authorizes us to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in our company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our company. As a result of approval by our stockholders of our amended and restated 2019 Incentive Plan on October 27, 2020, no new awards will be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding awards consist of our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and our 2019 ESPP. Share-based compensation awards available for grant or issuance for each plan as of the beginning of the fiscal year, including changes in the balance of awards available for grant for fiscal 2022, were as follows: Awards 2019 2019 Available 2019 Employee Employee 2010 Under All Incentive Inducement Stock Incentive DSPG Share-Based Compensation Equity Purchase Compensation Replacement Award Award Plans Plan Plan Plan Plan Plan Balance at June 2021 3,381,840 2,114,407 — 1,208,582 — 58,851 Additional shares authorized 2,000,000 2,000,000 — — — — Transferred between plans - 14,625 — — ( 14,625 ) — Restricted stock units granted ( 641,690 ) ( 582,839 ) — — — ( 58,851 ) Market stock units granted ( 65,000 ) ( 65,000 ) — — — — Performance stock units granted ( 96,914 ) ( 96,914 ) — — — — Performance stock units performance adjustment ( 133,627 ) ( 133,627 ) — — — — Market stock units performance adjustment ( 69,728 ) ( 33,675 ) — — ( 36,053 ) — Purchases under employee stock purchase plan ( 138,502 ) — — ( 138,502 ) — Forfeited 337,171 162,547 27,768 — 146,856 — Plan shares no longer available for new grants ( 123,946 ) — ( 27,768 ) — ( 96,178 ) — Balance at June 2022 4,449,604 3,379,524 — 1,070,080 — — Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 4.0 $ 3.4 $ 2.1 Research and development 42.5 45.4 32.3 Selling, general, and administrative 54.4 44.3 26.0 Total $ 100.9 $ 93.1 $ 60.4 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 23.1 $ 15.2 $ 6.3 F- 32 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.2 $ 0.4 $ 0.2 Research and development 27.2 21.9 9.1 Selling, general, and administrative 4.7 4.7 1.8 Total $ 32.1 $ 27.0 $ 11.1 We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans, including RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, PSUs, and phantom stock units. We do not recognize a tax benefit upon expensing all or a portion of share-based awards granted to certain executive officers and certain foreign-based employees. We compare the actual tax benefit associated with the tax deduction from share-based award activity to the hypothetical tax benefit based on the grant date fair values of the corresponding share-based awards. Tax benefit associated with excess tax deduction creditable to income tax provision is recognized when incurred. Tax deficiency associated with a tax shortfall is debited to income tax provision when incurred. Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding stock option awards include our 2010 Incentive Plan. Under our 2010 Incentive Plan, we were able to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock at not less than 100 % of the fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant. We ceased granting stock options in fiscal 2018. Options granted under our 2010 Incentive Plan generally vest three to four years from the vesting commencement date and expire seven years after the date of grant if not exercised. Certain stock option activity for fiscal 2022 and balances as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows: Stock Weighted Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (In millions) Balance at June 2021 55,061 $ 66.68 Exercised ( 23,876 ) 73.44 Balance at June 2022 31,185 61.50 $ 2.1 Exercisable at June 2022 31,185 61.50 $ 2.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022, or June 24, 2022 , of $ 128.78 . All of the stock options outstanding were vested and in-the-money as of the end of fiscal 2022. Cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Cash received $ 5.3 $ 23.9 $ 23.9 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 3.6 $ 8.6 $ 10.8 There have been no stock options granted since fiscal 2018. There was no unrecognized share-based compensation costs for stock options granted under our various plans. F- 33 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. We began granting DSUs in January 2006 and RSUs in 2019. The use of RSUs will cover the meaning of both RSUs and DSUs. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. Delivery of shares under the plans take place on the quarterly vesting dates. At the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory minimum tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. RSU activity, including RSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2022, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average RSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2021 1,323,286 $ 64.13 Granted 641,690 183.97 Delivered ( 578,400 ) 63.23 Forfeited ( 166,003 ) 120.72 Balance at June 2022 1,220,573 $ 157.2 119.83 Of the shares delivered, 169,529 shares valued at $ 31.4 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022, or June 24, 2022 , of $ 128.78 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost for RSUs granted under our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan was approximately $ 107.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years. The aggregate market value of RSUs delivered in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 106.4 million, $ 48.2 million, and $ 36.0 million, respectively. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, provide for the grant of MSU awards, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. F- 34 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2022, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average MSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2021 347,027 $ 82.18 Granted 65,000 191.68 Performance adjustment 69,728 — Delivered ( 203,883 ) 78.05 Forfeited ( 25,898 ) 136.26 Balance at June 2022 251,974 $ 32.4 As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 185.21 percentage points for the tranche three payout period ended in fiscal 2022, we delivered 200 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2019 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 226.12 percentage points for the tranche two payout period ended in fiscal 2022, we delivered 100 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2020 MSU grants as the tranche two payout is capped at a 100% payout. As a result of the Synaptics TSR performing at the 76 th percentile relative to the constituents of the Russell 2000 Index for the tranche one payout period ended in fiscal 2022, we delivered 200 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2021 MSU grants. Of the shares delivered, 105,719 shares valued at $ 18.3 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value assumes a 100 % payout factor and was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022, or June 24, 2022 , of $ 128.78 . F- 35 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The fair value of each MSU granted from our plans for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was estimated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions: 2022 2021 2020 Expected volatility of company 52.61 % 53.62 % 45.46 % - 52.55 % Expected volatility of Index 17.4 % - 581.6 % 19.6 % - 197.6 % 24.64 % - 33.44 % Correlation coefficient 0.53 0.51 0.53 - 0.58 Expected life in years 2.87 2.87 2.50 - 4.00 Risk-free interest rate 0.40 % 0.17 % 0.26 % - 1.52 % Fair value per award $ 284.43 - $ 342.89 $ 131.34 - $ 175.15 $ 55.52 - $ 100.38 We amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 14.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.72 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSU awards to our executive officers and other key management team members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which, generally, are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU award. Generally, PSU awards have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of performance relative to predefined performance criteria (for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and prior to fiscal 2021 the performance criteria is based on non-GAAP earnings per share, for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2021 the performance criteria is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses). For our fiscal 2022 PSU awards, the potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 75 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 125 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2022, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average PSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2021 317,392 $ 62.41 Granted 96,914 111.90 Performance adjustment 88,762 — Delivered ( 208,023 ) 55.01 Forfeited ( 37,142 ) 79.79 Balance at June 2022 257,903 $ 33.2 We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the grant date and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. Of the shares delivered, 94,642 shares valued at $ 17.6 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The PSU awards outstanding balance at June 2022 is based on the target grant quantity and does not include the performance adjustment of 183,472 shares for completed performance periods. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our F- 36 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 31.7 million as of June 25, 2022 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.72 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 135.07 per unit at June 25, 2022 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 15.4 million. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 140.17 per unit at June 26, 2021 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 18.4 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Aggregate Phantom Intrinsic Stock Units Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 402,458 Paid ( 196,420 ) Forfeited ( 29,941 ) Balance as of June 2022 176,097 $ 22.7 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 2019 ESPP became effective October 29, 2019 and replaced our 2010 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP, and previously the 2010 ESPP, allows employees to designate up to 15 % of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lesser of the FMV at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to one year and includes two exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the 2010 ESPP, the offering period extended for up to two years and included four exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, and previously under our 2010 ESPP, if the FMV at an exercise date is less than the FMV at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence. Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions, except shares purchased and weighted average purchase price): 2022 2021 2020 Shares purchased 138,502 220,389 346,502 Weighted average purchase price $ 97.90 $ 57.00 $ 30.50 Cash received $ 13.6 $ 12.6 $ 10.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 12.5 $ 10.3 $ 10.1 The fair value of each award granted under our 2019 ESPP and our 2010 ESPP for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per award for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 38.93 , $ 20.82 and $ 15.48 , respectively. Unrecognized share-based compensation costs for awards granted under our 2019 ESPP at the end of fiscal 2022 were approximately $ 1.4 million that will be amortized over the next 2 months. 12. Employee Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for full-time employees in the U.S. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their net compensation up to the annual limit of $ 20,500 , or $ 27,000 for employees who are 50 years or older. In fiscal 2022 , we provided matching funds of 25 % of our employees’ contributions, excluding catch-up contributions. F- 37 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The employer matching funds vest immediately. We made matching contributions of $ 1.7 million, $ 1.8 million and $ 2.1 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. 13. Income Taxes Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 United States $ ( 44.8 ) $ ( 21.0 ) $ ( 13.5 ) Foreign 365.3 141.1 172.9 Income before provision for income taxes $ 320.5 $ 120.1 $ 159.4 The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Current tax expense/(benefit) Federal $ ( 0.6 ) $ 4.1 $ 0.8 State — 0.1 — Foreign 94.9 36.1 35.4 94.3 40.3 36.2 Deferred tax expense/(benefit) Federal ( 21.8 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 5.8 ) State - - 0.1 Foreign ( 7.9 ) ( 8.4 ) 8.1 ( 29.7 ) ( 8.9 ) 2.4 Provision for income taxes $ 64.6 $ 31.4 $ 38.6 The provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Provision at U.S. federal statutory tax rate $ 67.3 $ 25.1 $ 33.5 State income taxes — 0.1 — Non-deductible share-based compensation 7.9 5.2 3.0 (Windfall)/shortfall related to share-based compensation ( 18.1 ) ( 3.8 ) 2.1 Non-deductible officer compensation 6.4 6.4 1.9 Business credits ( 10.0 ) ( 3.8 ) ( 6.1 ) Foreign tax differential 6.4 ( 6.7 ) 4.9 Foreign income inclusion 3.6 5.2 0.7 Deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 0.7 3.5 — Other differences 0.4 0.2 ( 1.4 ) Provision for income taxes $ 64.6 $ 31.4 $ 38.6 F- 38 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in “Non-current other assets” and “Other long-term liabilities”, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Capital loss carryforward $ 17.8 $ 0.2 Inventory write downs 2.6 3.9 Property and equipment and intangible assets 11.7 6.0 Share-based compensation 12.0 8.8 Nondeductible interest 5.4 — Business credit carryforward 62.0 39.1 Lease liabilities 11.2 6.5 Net operating loss carryforward 16.3 7.2 Other accruals 5.6 5.1 144.6 76.8 Valuation allowance ( 59.0 ) ( 32.6 ) 85.6 44.2 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 2.0 ) ( 0.9 ) Interest — ( 3.4 ) Right-of-use assets ( 11.5 ) ( 6.2 ) Unremitted foreign earnings ( 22.1 ) ( 3.5 ) Acquisition intangibles ( 45.8 ) ( 29.0 ) ( 81.4 ) ( 43.0 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 4.2 $ 1.2 Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2022, a valuation allowance of $ 59.0 million was maintained to reduce deferred tax assets primarily related to state tax credits and capital losses carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2022 was an increase of $ 26.4 million, primarily due to an increase of unrealized deferred tax assets associated with the capital loss carryforwards from our DSPG acquisition.. We consider most of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. Further, we determined not to indefinitely reinvest earnings of certain subsidiaries acquired as part of our DSPG acquisition and established a $ 17.9 million deferred tax liability on the acquisition date balance sheet. As a result, $ 22.1 million of our deferred tax liability is associated with unremitted foreign earnings, which if remitted would not result in a further provision for income taxes. We continue to indefinitely reinvest $ 200 million on certain accumulated earnings and outside basis differences primarily related to our DSPG acquisition. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, the associated foreign tax credits would be expected to reduce the U.S. income tax liability associated with the foreign distribution or the otherwise taxable transaction. As of our fiscal 2022, assuming full utilization of the associated foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and outside basis differences would be approximately $ 46 million. F- 39 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had federal, California, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 37.7 million, $1 4.8 million, and $ 58.2 million, respectively. The federal and California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2034 and 2029 , respectively, if not utilized. Most of our foreign net operating losses have no expiration date. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income or income taxes may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership. We had $ 25.4 million and $ 50.4 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2022. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2029 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, increased by $ 7.2 million from $ 22.6 million in fiscal 2021 to $ 29.8 million in fiscal 2022. Of this amount, $ 19.6 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 22.6 $ 20.1 $ 18.9 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions 7.1 5.5 3.2 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions 5.5 — 0.1 Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ( 0.5 ) — — Decrease due to statute expiration ( 4.9 ) ( 3.0 ) ( 2.1 ) Ending Balance $ 29.8 $ 22.6 $ 20.1 Accrued interest and penalties increased by $ 0.8 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 and decreased by $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 2.5 million and $ 1.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $ 0.9 million to an increase of $ 6.9 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to inc ome tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Israel and the U.K. From fiscal 2016 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In January 2022, final foreign tax credit regulations, final regulations, were issued by the U.S. Treasury modifying long established rules, including rules used in the determination of whether foreign taxes paid or accrued are creditable against U.S. income taxes. Subsequently, in July 2022, technical corrections and amendments to the final regulations were issued by the U.S. Treasury. These technical corrections and amendments do not change our initial view that certain foreign taxes we incur may not be creditable under the final regulations. We are currently assessing the impact of the final regulations, together with certain research and development capitalization rules, all effective beginning with our fiscal 2023, but anticipate the impact will have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2023 and future provision for income taxes. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product applications market, the personal computing, or PC, product applications market, and the mobile, product applications market. F- 40 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 China $ 609.1 $ 524.0 $ 540.6 Taiwan 539.4 382.6 204.5 Japan 453.1 330.7 446.5 Other 83.9 69.5 77.3 South Korea 39.1 28.5 58.3 United States 15.1 4.3 6.7 $ 1,739.7 $ 1,339.6 $ 1,333.9 Net revenue from external customers for each group of similar products for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 IoT product applications $ 1,100.9 $ 612.9 $ 329.8 PC product applications 343.0 354.7 317.4 Mobile product applications 295.8 372.0 686.7 $ 1,739.7 $ 1,339.6 $ 1,333.9 A reclassification has been made to the prior periods revenue presentation in the above table in order to conform to the current period revenue presentation. The reclassification o f $ 32.0 million and $ 12.2 million during the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively, moved virtual reality product revenue from Mobile product applications to IoT product applications. Long-lived assets within geographic areas as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): 2022 2021 United States $ 118.2 $ 168.5 Asia/Pacific 624.7 191.9 Europe 516.6 602.3 $ 1,259.5 $ 962.7 Our goodwill of $ 806.6 million has been allocated to two reporting units which include IoT and Mobile/PC. Major customers’ revenue as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Customer A * 14 % 18 % Customer B 13 % 13 % * Customer C 12 % 10 % 12 % * Less than 10 % 15. Restructuring Activities We have initiated various strategic restructuring actions primarily intended to reduce costs, gain synergies from our recent acquisitions and align our business in response to market conditions. The following table summarizes the restructuring activity and related charges during the periods presented (in millions): Years Ended 2022 2021 2020 Balance, beginning of period $ 0.2 $ 6.1 $ 5.2 Charges 18.3 7.4 33.0 Payments ( 17.1 ) ( 13.3 ) ( 32.1 ) Balance, end of period $ 1.4 $ 0.2 $ 6.1 F- 41 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) During fiscal 2022, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $ 18.3 million in our consolidated statements of operations. The charges were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities and gain synergies from the DSPG acquisition. These activities from the restructuring actions taken during fiscal 2022 are complete as of the end of fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2021, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $ 7.4 million in our consolidated statements of operations. The charges were for activities to gain synergies from our DisplayLink acquisition. The activities from the restructuring actions taken during fiscal 2021 were complete as of the end of fiscal 2021.

Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections in this report on Form 10-K, and other risks as identified from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate, governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees have worked from home since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. As the broad roll out of vaccines continues in various countries in which we operate, many employees have returned to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis. As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will moderate the overall severity and duration and remain cautiously optimistic the most significant impact has passed. If more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, however, we could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences.

We believe our engineering know-how and electronic systems expertise provide significant benefits to our customers by enabling them to concentrate on their core competencies of production and marketing. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed 1,085 people in our technology, engineering, and product design functions in the United States, or the U.S., China, Taiwan, Japan, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., India, Poland, Korea, and Hong Kong. Our research and development expenses were $313.4 million, $302.5 million, and $342.7 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Intellectual Property Rights Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other statutory and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may provide only limited protection. 11 As of June 26, 2021 , we held 2,095 active patents and 708 pending patent applications worldwide that expire between 2021 and 2042 . Collectively, these patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our key technologies, including those for touch sensing, voice processing, secure biometrics, display driver s, touch and display integration, docks and adapters, video interfaces, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, audio processing, video processing, edge computing, open AI tools, and computer vision . Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are also protected by copyright laws and applicable trade secret laws. Our extensive array of technologies include those related to ICs, firmware, software, and mechanical hardware. Our products rely on a combination of these technologies, making it difficult to use any single technology as the basis for replicating our products. Furthermore, the lengths of our customers’ design cycles and the customizations required within the products we provide to our customers also serve to protect our intellectual property rights. Customers Our customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMs, automotive manufacturers and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost-effectiveness, and on-time deliveries have resulted in our leadership position in providing human experience semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions which are focused in several of our target markets, will continue to position us as a source of supply for their product offerings. Our leading OEM customers in fiscal 2021 included the following: • Acer • Microsoft • Ampak • Oculus • Bouygues Telecom • Oppo Mobile • Dell • Poly • Ford • Samsung • Fujitsu • Sony • Google • Targus • Goodway • Technicolor • Hewlett-Packard • Toshiba • Honor • Toyota Motor • Huawei • Vivo • Lenovo • Winstar • Logitech • Xiaomi We generally supply custom-designed products to OEMs through their co ntract manufacturers, supply chain or distributors. We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human experience semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions. 12 Sales and Marketing We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed 189 sales and marketing professionals. We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the U.S., Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Japan, and Europe. In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors that are primarily located in the U.S., China, Korea and Taiwan. International sales constituted over 98% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. Approximately 68%, 78%, and 78% of our sales in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major notebook computer and mobile product applications OEMs. Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Manufacturing We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom interface products or processed as our ASIC-based solution. After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom human experience solution or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products. We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment. Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available. In some cases, we have alternative sources of suppliers to mitigate supplier risk; however, in the current environment, all of them could be constrained. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any one source of supply. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand declines. 13 Competition IoT Our SoC solutions enable new forms of media consumption and integrate video processing, far-field voice and linguistics processing products are sold into market segments that offer significant potential growth, ranging from home automation applications, smart assistant platforms, surveillance cameras, to STB/OTT platforms.

ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. Risks Related to Our Markets and Customers We currently depend on our solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT), PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of our products into any of these markets would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in any of these markets, or a slowdown of growth in any of these markets because of changes in customer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer. A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to three direct customers each accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2021, we had three OEM customers that integrated our products into their products representing approximately 22%, 17% and 11% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, and business. We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult. We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results. The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy. 17 We cannot assure you that our product solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets. Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets. Various target markets for our product solutions, such as IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: • the development and growth of these markets; • the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets, the price and performance requirements of OEMs, and the preferences of end users; and • our ability to provide OEMs with solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions. Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future. If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers’ products that utilize our solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline. We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our solutions. Instead, we design various solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers’ products that incorporate our solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales could decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our solutions. We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers and expand our relationships with OEMs in new markets. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue. In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities in the markets in which we operate, particularly in the IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets. Risks Related to Our Supply Chain We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results. We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in Asia. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long- 18 term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. In our fiscal year 2021, we faced manufacturing capacity constraints as a result of the supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry that materially limited our ability to meet our customers’ demand forecasts, thereby limiting our potential revenue growth during the fiscal year. As a result of the supply shortages, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with certain of our suppliers. If end customer demand declines, these long-term capacity agreements could result in significant write-downs of inventory. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to enable us to meet our customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results. Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Supply shortages in our fiscal year 2021 have resulted in increased product costs, not all of which we passed on to our customers. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue. Risks Related to Product Development We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue. We provide solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of solutions for our OEMs’ products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer’s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer’s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue. We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the markets in which we operate, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the markets in which we operate, and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins. 19 Some of our competitors have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer. We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we may be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential solutions. Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results. We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following: • innovative development of new solutions for customer products; • utilization of advances in technology; • maintenance of quality standards; • performance advantages; • efficient and cost-effective solutions; and • timely completion of the design and introduction of new solutions. Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth. If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue. We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. Manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or 20 failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts. We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Risks Related to International Sales and Operations Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export, and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier, or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 21 Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the U . S . and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China’s overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue, and operating results. International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in Taiwan, China, and Korea by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in China, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.K. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing a multinational organization; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; • differing labor regulations; • differing environmental laws and regulations, including in response to climate change; • potentially adverse tax consequences; • possible employee turnover or labor unrest; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; • the volatility of currency exchange rates; • potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights; • political or economic instability in certain parts of the world; and • natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis. If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2021, approximately 13% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including British pounds, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, Polish zloty, and Swiss francs. 22 If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Risks Related to Our Employees We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel. Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the U.S., could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan. If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the U.S. We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or 23 otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products. We may pursue, and from time to time defend, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third-party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third-party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology. In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third-party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Risks Related to Acquisitions Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses. 24 We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following: • the potential disruption of our core business; • the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures; • potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business; • costs relating to liabilities which we agree to assume; • unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; • diversion of management’s attention from our core business; • problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies, or products; • risks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience; • failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results; • adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; • failure to retain key customers, suppliers, or personnel of acquired businesses; • the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and • the potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business. Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth. We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets. We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company. In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant Systems, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the “Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state, and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 25 Risks Factors Related to Our Indebtedness Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, our 4.000% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time. On March 11, 2021, we completed the offering of the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, with a corresponding amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, or as amended and supplemented, the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Senior Notes include a mandatory semi-annual payment of a 4.000% coupon. We are permitted under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: • making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the Notes, the Credit Agreement, or our other outstanding debt from time to time; • risking an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Notes indenture or the Credit Agreement, which could result in the Senior Notes or any outstanding bank debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to foreclose on the assets securing such bank debt; • subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the debt that we may incur under the Credit Agreement; • the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023 and the replacement rate could be more volatile or more costly, resulting in a higher cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement; • reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Senior Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. The covenants in the Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; and (x) engage in a new line of business. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may 26 make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. General Risk Factors Our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate could adversely impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers and customers. Any of these public health threats and related consequences could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. COVID-19 has spread rapidly and enveloped most of the world, causing a global public health crisis . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Governments in affected countries continue to periodically impose travel bans, quarantines, and other emergency public health measures. In response to the virus, national and local governments in numerous countries around the world have implemented substantial lockdown measures. These restrictions, and prevention and mitigation measures, have had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect our future operations. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition, and cash flows. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. Also, some suppliers of materials used in the production of our products may be located in areas more severely or repeatedly impacted by COVID-19 and its variants, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products. In addition, the severe global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 may cause our customers and end-users of our products to suffer significant economic hardship, which could result in decreased demand for our products in the future and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer. The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to: • successfully hire, train, retain, and motivate additional employees, including employees outside the U.S.; • efficiently plan, expand, or cost-effectively reduce our facilities to meet headcount requirements; • enhance our global operational, financial, and management infrastructure; and • expand our development and production capacity. In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the IoT market, the PC applications market, and the mobile product applications market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design, or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer. 27 We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, ransomware, and other attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows. We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. We collect, use, and store personally identifiable information, or PII, as part of our business and operations. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of PII. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. The theft, loss or misuse of PII collected, used, stored or transferred by us, our any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and discourage a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on 28 certain business combination transactions with “interested stockholders.” Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third - party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third - party’s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: • variations in our quarterly results; • the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance; • changes in financial estimates by industry or securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates; • various market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our suppliers, our competitors, or a potential acquisition of our company; • announcements of technological innovations by us, our competitors, or our customers; • introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us, our competitors, or our customers; • acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or our customers; • recruitment or departure of key personnel; • the gain or loss of significant orders; • the gain or loss of significant customers; • market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole; • short positions held by investors; • new federal and state laws and regulations affecting our industry; and • general financial market conditions or occurrences, including market volatility resulting from geopolitical risks, and rivalries, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, health pandemics, financial market technological glitches and interruptions of trading activity. In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive offices, as well as our principal research and development, sales, marketing, and administrative functions, are located in San Jose, California, where we own and utilize approximately 161,000 square feet of facilities. We also have research and development functions in leased offices in California, Georgia, and Massachusetts. Our two Asia/Pacific principal offices are located in leased offices in Hong Kong and Japan, where we have sales, operations, and research and development functions. We have leased facilities with logistics operations in Hong Kong and Japan, leased facilities with sales and support operations in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, and Taiwan, and leased facilities with engineering design support operations in China, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K. and California, U.S. 29 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For further information regarding current legal proceedings, see Note 7 Leases, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 30 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information on Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol ""SYNA"" since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. Stockholders As of August 13, 2021, there were approximately 120 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 13, 2021 was $172.93. Dividends We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make our debt payments, or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results, and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Credit Agreement also places restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement, see Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Stock-Based Compensation For information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities From April 2005 through July 2021, our Board of Directors cumulatively authorized the repurchase of $1.8 billion for our common stock in our stock repurchase program, which expires in July 2025. The remaining amount authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program was $577.4 million. During the three-month period ended June 26, 2021, there were no repurchases under our stock repurchase program. 31 Performance Graph The following line graph compares cumulative total stockholder returns for the five years ended June 26, 2021 for (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index and (iii) the Russell 2000 Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2016. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index include reinvestment of dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period. The historical performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The performance graph above shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. The performance graph above will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of our company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. 32 ITEM 6. RESERVED ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate, governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees have worked from home since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. As the broad roll out of vaccines continues in various countries in which we operate, many employees have returned to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis. As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will moderate the overall severity and duration and remain cautiously optimistic the most significant impact has passed. If more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, however, we could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed semiconductor solutions that is changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. For fiscal 2021, revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 43.4% of our net revenue, revenue from the PC product applications market accounted for 26.5% of our net revenue, and revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 30.2% of our net revenue. 33 Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U . K . , and the U .S. , we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets. See below under “Divestiture”. Gain on sale of assets includes the sale of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. See below under “Divestiture”. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes, 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or Convertible Notes, and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 34 Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. S ee Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. As of June 26, 2021, our purchase consideration was $444.0 million. The results of DisplayLink are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from August 1, 2020 through June 26, 2021. For further discussion of the DisplayLink acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 24, 2020 through June 26, 2021. For further discussion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Divestitures In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction, licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third-party to sell the assets of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020 for cash consideration of $138.7 million. The gain on sale of this business component was $105.1 million. 35 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity’s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity’s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty, and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations within Other Accrued Liabilities as disclosed in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. 36 We invoice customers and recognize a ll of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions . We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We classify shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Inventory We state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. Business Combinations We have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill recognized in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach. The valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future, beyond our one year measurement period, that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our results of operations. 37 Results of Operations The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2021 and 2020 along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages): 2021 2020 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 580.9 $ 317.6 $ 263.3 82.9 % PC product applications 354.7 317.4 37.3 11.8 % Mobile product applications 404.0 698.9 (294.9 ) (42.2 %) Net revenue 1,339.6 1,333.9 5.7 0.4 % Gross margin 611.2 543.1 68.1 12.5 % Operating expenses: Research and development 313.4 302.5 10.9 3.6 % Selling, general, and administrative 144.9 127.0 17.9 14.1 % Acquired intangibles amortization 32.7 11.7 21 179.5 % Restructuring costs 7.4 33.0 (25.6 ) (77.6 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets (34.2 ) - (34.2 ) (100.0 %) Operating income 147.0 68.9 78.1 113.4 % Interest and other income, net 2.9 7.9 (5.0 ) (63.3 %) Interest expense (29.5 ) (22.5 ) (7.0 ) 31.1 % Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.3 ) — (0.3 ) (100.0 %) Gain on sale of assets — 105.1 (105.1 ) (100.0 %) Income before provision for income taxes 120.1 159.4 (39.3 ) (24.7 %) Provision for income taxes 31.4 38.6 (7.2 ) (18.7 %) Equity investment loss (9.1 ) (2.0 ) (7.1 ) 355.0 % Net income $ 79.6 $ 118.8 $ (39.2 ) (33.0 %) The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Percentage Point Increase 2021 2020 (Decrease) IoT product applications 43.3 % 23.8 % 19.5 % PC product applications 26.5 % 23.8 % 2.7 % Mobile product applications 30.2 % 52.4 % (22.2 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 45.6 % 40.7 % 4.9 % Operating expenses: Research and development 23.4 % 22.7 % 0.7 % Selling, general, and administrative 10.8 % 9.5 % 1.3 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.4 % 0.9 % 1.5 % Restructuring costs 0.6 % 2.5 % (1.9 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets (2.6 %) 0.0 % (2.6 %) Operating income 11.0 % 5.2 % 5.8 % Interest and other income, net 0.2 % 0.6 % (0.4 %) Interest expense (2.2 %) (1.7 %) (0.5 %) Gain on sale of assets 0.0 % 7.9 % (7.9 %) Income before provision for income taxes 9.0 % 11.9 % (2.9 %) Provision for income taxes 2.3 % 2.9 % (0.6 %) Equity investment loss (0.7 %) (0.1 %) (0.6 %) Net income 5.9 % 8.9 % (3.0 %) 38 Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $1,339.6 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $1,333.9 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $5.7 million, or 0.4%. Of our fiscal 2021 net revenue, $580.9 million, or 43.3%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market, $354.7 million, or 26.5%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $404.0 million, or 30.2%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market. The overall increase in net revenue for fiscal 2021 was attributable to an increase of $263.3 million, or 82.9%, in net revenue from IoT product applications and an increase of $37.3 million, or 11.8%, in net revenue from PC product applications, partially offset by a decrease of $294.9 million, or 42.2%, in net revenue from mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by a 26% increase in the units sold as well as a 45.2% increase in average selling prices. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by a 9.3% increase in the units sold and a 2.3% increase in average selling prices. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a 35.4% decrease in the units sold due primarily to the divestment of our TDDI product line during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45.6%, or $611.2 million, for fiscal 2021 compared with 40.7%, or $543.1 million, for fiscal 2020. The 490 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable product mix and product costs reductions, partially offset by a $37.6 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization that was charged to cost of revenue during the year primarily related to the acquisition of DisplayLink and the Broadcom Business Acquisition and $26.0 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the DisplayLink acquisition. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $10.9 million, to $313.4 million, for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $13.1 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to an increase in our phantom stock liability resulting from the increase in our stock price; a $9.2 million increase due to the amortization of prepaid development services related to the Broadcom Business Acquisition; and a $1.5 million increase in non-employee services; partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in software licenses and maintenance; a $3.8 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 9.9% decrease in research and development headcount from restructuring actions initiated in both fiscal 2020 and 2021 to reduce costs, which exceeded the increase in headcount due to recent acquisitions; a $2.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment related costs as a result of reduced headcount as well as travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and a $2.4 million in-process research and development charge in fiscal 2020 not repeated in fiscal 2021. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $17.9 million, to $144.9 million, for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $18.3 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to new executive grants and the increase in value of our phantom stock liability resulting from the increase in our stock price; a $5.0 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, largely driven by the timing of executive team hiring in fiscal year 2020 and 2021, including a higher overall bonus accrual driven by higher profitability in fiscal 2021; and a $1.2 million increase in accounting and consulting fees associated with our recent acquisitions; partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in bad debt expense; a $3.0 million decrease in legal fees; and a $1.7 million decrease in travel and entertainment related costs as a result of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 39 Restructuring C osts. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 202 1 were $ 7.4 million and in fiscal 2020 were $ 33.0 million. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on Sale of Audio Technology Assets. Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio products. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Divestiture, to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Non-Operating Income. Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net was $2.9 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $7.9 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease in interest and other income, net was due to lower interest rates in fiscal 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $29.5 million and $22.5 million, in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes issued in June 2017 as well as interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes issued in March 2021. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on Sale of Assets. Gain on sale of assets in fiscal 2020 includes the sale of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Divestiture, to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Provision for Income Taxes. As a result of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted in December 2017 by the U.S. government, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. statutory tax rate is lower than tax rates in many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. This resulted in an increase to our effective tax rate relating to foreign tax rate differential for our fiscal 2019. However, this was largely offset by the remeasurement and release of various uncertain tax positions. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $3.4 million to an increase of $3.0 million. Fiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 21, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $836.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2021 compared with $763.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2020, an increase of $72.9 million. This increase reflected cash flows provided by operating activities of $319.2 million and $274.1 million of cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by $522.6 million of cash used in investing activities. We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of June 27, 2021, $247.5 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we will be able to repatriate these funds without an impact on our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2021, the $319.2 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $79.6 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $110.1 million, share-based compensation costs of $66.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $21.6 million, and a reduction of $34.2 million for gain on sale of audio technology assets, as well as other non-cash 40 adjustments of $ 30.4 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $45.6 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $53.1 million de crease in inventories , a $32.2 million in crease in accounts payable , and a $14.9 million increase in accrued compensation ; partially offset by a $25.9 million in crease in accounts receivable , a $17.2 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, and a $ 9.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets . Our days sales outstanding remained flat at 63 days in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 . Our inventory turns in creased to seven in fiscal 2021 from six in 2020 . For fiscal 2020, the $221.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $118.8 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $51.4 million, share-based compensation costs of $49.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.7 million, and a reduction of $105.1 million for gain on sale of assets, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $28.9 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $51.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $43.0 million decrease in inventories, a $31.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $29.1 million increase in accrued compensation, and a $13.8 million increase in income taxes payable; partially offset by a $36.2 million decrease in accounts payable and a $29.9 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. Our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 63 days from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. Our inventory turns increased to six in fiscal 2020 from five in 2019. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 was $522.6 million and net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 was $119.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of $626.5 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and $21.1 million used for the purchases of capital assets; partially offset by $95.8 million in proceeds from sales of investments and $34.2 million in proceeds from sale of audio technology assets. Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of $138.7 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by $16.3 million used for the purchases of capital assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2021 was $274.1 million and for fiscal 2020 was $93.9 million. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to $400.0 million in proceeds from issuance of debt and $27.8 million in proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $100.0 million of payment on the line-of-credit borrowings, $28.2 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, and $19.4 million used for payment for redemption of convertible notes. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to $100.0 million proceeds from borrowing under the line-of-credit and $34.5 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $30.2 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market and $9.7 million used for payroll taxes for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. For discussion related to the statement of cash flows for fiscal 2019, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 23, 2019. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 26, 2021, our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an aggregate of $1.4 billion of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, which was subsequently increased to $1.8 billion in August 2021 and extended through July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2021, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. As of June 26, 2021, and as of August 2021, we had $177.4 million, and $577.4 million, respectively, remaining under our common stock repurchase program. Senior Debt. On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Senior Notes Indenture, by and among us, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. 41 Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date . We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are our general unsecured obligations. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Senior Notes Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Senior Notes Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Convertible Debt . On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we issued and sold, and the Initial Purchasers purchased, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, by and among us, and Wells Fargo, National Association, as trustee. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. 42 The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Effective April 1, 2021, the Sales Price Condition of our Convertible Notes had been met at the end of the preceding calendar quarter and holders of our notes became entitled to redeem their notes in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture during the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, a total of $19.4 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes were submitted for conversion, which was completed by June 26, 2021 through a combination of $19.4 million in cash and 118,092 shares of common stock from our treasury shares, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.3 million. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Convertible Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. On June 1, 2021, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption for all $525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes, or Redemption. The Convertible Notes are redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021, or the Redemption Price. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate is equal to 13.7267 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement with a Specified Dollar Amount per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of the our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we paid $505.6 million in cash for the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $8.1 million. Bank Credit Facility. On March 11, 2021, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a 43 requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement . The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of June 26, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, was 2.65%. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement, which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100.0 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of June 26, 2021, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on COVID-19 variants, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to 44 support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements. While we have accrued taxes on almost all of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would impact our operating cash flows. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2021 (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,033.2 $ 521.2 $ 32.0 $ 32.0 $ 448.0 Leases 37.7 10.0 10.3 7.7 9.7 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 136.1 86.1 50.0 — — Transition tax payable (3) 8.1 0.9 4.2 3.0 — Total $ 1,215.1 $ 618.2 $ 96.5 $ 42.7 $ 457.7 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $22.6 million. As of June 26, 2021, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. Subsequent to our fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, we executed an agreement for purchase and supply commitment with one of our contract manufacturers, under which we have a minimum commitment obligation estimated at approximately $111.0 million over a period of three years. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued accounting standard update, or ASU, No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments, requiring bifurcation only if the convertible debt feature qualifies as a derivative under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 815 or for convertible debt issued at a substantial premium. The ASU removes certain settlement 45 conditions required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, permitting more contracts to qualify for it. In addition, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted no earlier than the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, or ASU 2019-12 , an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions for intra-period tax allocations and deferred tax liabilities for equity method investments and adds guidance regarding whether a step-up in tax basis of goodwill relates to a business combination or a separate transaction. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU at the beginning of our fiscal 2022, and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 46 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include: Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our total net revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 13%, 12%, and 11% of our total costs for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We face the risk that our accounts payable and acquisition-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 2% and 3% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies at June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost, and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes by approximately $14.9 million and our net income by approximately $17.2 million for fiscal 2021, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. Interest Rate Risk on Cash, Cash Equivalents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. There have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents subsequent to fiscal 2021. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Reference is made to the financial statements, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, and the notes thereto commencing at page F-1 of this report, which financial statements, report, and notes are incorporated herein by reference. Reference is also made to the quarterly results of operations included elsewhere in this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 26, 2021, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 47 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 26, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2021 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-2. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended June 26, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F-2 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company held $82.0 million of inventories as of June 26, 2021, which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions. Additionally, a liability and a charge are recorded to cost of sales for estimated losses on inventory the Company is obligated to purchase from contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule, cancels its order, or for other factors. We identified the valuation of inventories associated with excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of net realizable value for these inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand that may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product improvements, or technological advances due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory and recognition of losses related to outstanding inventory purchase obligations, including controls related to the evaluation of the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand. For a selection of inventory items, we assessed the Company’s assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. We also considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. For a selection of inventory items, we recalculated the required write-downs and losses and compared this to the recorded amounts. We confirmed with the Company’s significant vendors regarding outstanding purchase obligations of the Company. Additionally, we tested a sample of returns which resulted from quality related issues of the Company's products during the year and subsequent to period-end to evaluate if additional write-downs or losses were warranted. Evaluation of certain intangible assets acquired through business combinations As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended June 26, 2021, the Company consummated two business combinations for total consideration of $670.6 million. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded various intangible assets, which included developed technology, customer relationships, and In-Process Research & Development (“IPR&D”) with an acquisition-date fair value of $175.0 million, $72.0 million, and $51.0 million, respectively. We identified the evaluation of the fair value allocated to acquired developed technology, customer relationships and IPR&D intangible assets as a critical audit matter. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the significant assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets, individually and in the aggregate. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were sensitive to possible changes to the following key assumptions, requiring a high degree of auditor judgment and the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge: Developed technology: ● Forecasted revenue growth rates ● Technology migration F-3 Customer relationships: ● Estimated customer ramp up periods IPR&D: ● Forecasted revenue growth rates ● Technology migration The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation processes, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions, as listed above. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates, technology migration, and estimated customer ramp up periods by comparing them to historical actual results of the acquired entities and certain peer and market participant data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: ● evaluating certain peer group and market participant data used in the assessment of forecasted revenue growth rates by assessing the appropriateness of the guideline comparable companies identified by management’s specialist and recalculating certain peer group and market participant data ● assessing the reasonableness of technology migration based on the nature of the technology acquired. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Basis of Presentation We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed semiconductor solutions that is changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We currently generate revenue from the markets for Internet of Things, or IoT, products, which include smart devices with voice, speech, video, wireless connectivity, smartphones, augmented reality and virtual reality devices, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles. We deliver semiconductor solutions including connectivity products, audio input and output System-On-Chips, or SoCs, high-definition video and vision SoCs, touch controllers, display drivers, fingerprint sensors, and touchpads, which comprise our semiconductor chip, firmware, and software as a complete customer solution. The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. The fiscal years presented in this report were 52-week periods ended June 26, 2021, June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2021 are bank deposits and as of the end of fiscal 2020 were money market accounts with a fair value of $ 509.1 million and $ 521.1 million, respectively. Fair Value We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. When we measure fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level as follows: • Level 1 inputs are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions, which are incorporated into valuation techniques and models used to determine fair value. The assumptions are consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. F-10 Our financial assets measured at fair value are bank deposits and money market accounts, are included on a recurring basis, and are level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. As of the end of fiscal 2021 our bank deposit balances were $ 509.1 million and at the end of fiscal 2020 our money market balances were $ 521.1 million. There were no transfers in or out of our Level 1, 2 or 3 assets during fiscal 2021 or 2020. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. The fair value of our $ 400.0 million principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the senior notes as of June 26, 2021 was approximately $ 401.5 million, based on the last trading price of the senior notes for the period. The fair value of our $ 505.6 million principal amount of 0.50% convertible notes due 2022 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the convertible notes as of June 26, 2021 was approximately $ 1,013.3 million, based on the last trading price of the convertible notes for the period. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy, which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity, limits investments to U.S. government treasuries and agency issues, taxable securities, and municipal issued securities with a minimum rating of A1 (Moody’s) or P1 (Standard and Poor’s) or their equivalent. We sell our products to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services for OEMs, to some OEMs directly, and to distributors. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. The following customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Customer A 15 % * Customer B 12 % 18 % Customer C * 21 % * Less than 10 % Other Concentrations Our products include certain components that are currently single sourced. We believe other vendors would be able to provide similar components, however, the qualification of such vendors may require additional lead time. In order to mitigate any potential adverse impact from a supply disruption, we strive to maintain an adequate supply of critical single-sourced components. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. F-11 Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. In fiscal 2021, there was no material bad debt charge recorded on accounts receivable. There was $ 1.9 million of contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 26, 2021, and $ 0.4 million as of June 27, 2020. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 7.0 million and $ 36.1 million, respectively, as of June 26, 2021, and $ 3.2 million and $ 25.8 million, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 1.8 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of June 26, 2021, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the ASC, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are incurred after the product has been shipped. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. Advertising Costs Advertising costs, if any, are expensed when incurred. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts F-12 We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends, and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional bad debt allowances may be required. For the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 there were no credit losses on our accounts receivable and for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020 credit losses on our accounts receivable were $ 3.7 million , and they were insignificant in the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019 , and we believe that an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to our customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers, and the related assembly, package, and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; acquired intangibles amortization; fair value adjustments associated with acquired businesses; inventory write-downs and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020, and consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 49.1 $ 53.6 Finished goods 32.9 48.4 $ 82.0 $ 102.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write-up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. Other Assets In December 2020, we invested $ 5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a strategic relationship that enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. In April 2017, we paid $ 18.4 million for a 14.4 % interest in OXi Technology Ltd., or OXi. In April 2019, our investment ownership was reduced to 13.8 % as a result of new investment in OXi. Our investment in OXi is included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We determined the equity method of accounting applies to our investment as we have significant influence over OXi’s operating and financial policies. We record our portion of OXi’s net income/(loss) on a one quarter lag due to the timing of the availability of OXi’s financial records. In addition, we amortize intangible assets that we recorded under the equity method of accounting, and such amortization as well as our portion of OXi’s net income/(loss) is included in equity investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations. We did not have any material related party transactions with OXi. As of June 26, 2021, we recorded a $ 7.7 million impairment charge on our investment in OXi, which is included in Equity investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations. F-13 Foreign Currency The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in our functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. These foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses, resulted in a net loss of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.1 million in fiscal 2021 and 2019, respectively, and a net gain of $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2020. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Changes in our goodwill balance for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 360.8 $ 372.8 Acquisition activity 209.2 — Goodwill allocated to sale of product line — ( 12.0 ) Ending balance $ 570.0 $ 360.8 We have allocated our goodwill to two reporting units. We perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or earlier if a triggering event occurs. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of key factors including change in industry and competitive environment, potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, market capitalization, stock price, gross margin and cash flow from operating activities. During our qualitative assessment in fiscal 2021, we determined there were no triggering events that led us to performing a step 1 quantitative assessment. No goodwill impairment was recognized for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the last quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. F-14 Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods if a triggering event occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities As of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020, other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 Customer obligations $ 43.1 $ 29.0 Inventory obligations 17.0 27.9 Warranty 5.4 3.9 Other 30.7 30.2 $ 96.2 $ 91.0 As of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020, other long-term accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 Income taxes payable, long-term $ 15.4 $ 16.4 Non-current deferred tax liability 27.1 — Operating lease liabilities, long-term 24.0 14.6 Other 12.0 13.0 $ 78.5 $ 44.0 Segment Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of human experience semiconductor solutions for electronic devices and products. The chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is our CEO, Our CODM evaluates financial performance and allocates resources using financial information reported on a company-wide basis. Share-Based Compensation We charge the estimated fair value less actual forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire underlying award, which is generally three to four years for our restricted stock units, or RSU, awards, three years for our market stock units, or MSU, awards, three years for our performance stock units, or PSU, awards, and up to one year for shares purchased under our 2019 employee stock purchase plan . F-15 We estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, which is generally three years . The Monte Carlo simulation model that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based MSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. As our phantom stock is a cash-settled award, it is recorded as a liability and remeasured each reporting period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in income on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. F-16 2 . Net Income/(Loss) Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income/(loss) per share for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2021 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income/(loss) $ 79.6 $ 118.8 $ ( 22.9 ) Denominator: Shares, basic 34.8 33.6 34.6 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 3.5 1.2 — Shares, diluted 38.3 34.8 34.6 Net income/(loss) per share: Basic $ 2.29 $ 3.54 $ ( 0.66 ) Diluted $ 2.08 $ 3.41 $ ( 0.66 ) Diluted net income per share does not include the effect of potential common shares related to certain share-based awards for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Share-based awards — 0.7 2.2 These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the proceeds received, if any, from such share-based awards combined with the average unamortized compensation costs, were greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive. Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, RSUs, MSUs, PSUs and our convertible notes. 3 . Property and Equipment Property and equipment as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): Life 2021 2020 Land — $ 13.3 $ 13.3 Building and building improvements Up to 35 years 52.7 52.7 Computer equipment 3 - 5 years 42.9 41.6 Manufacturing equipment 1 - 5 years 57.9 51.9 Furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements 3 - 10 years 27.2 25.2 Capitalized software 3 - 7 years 28.2 30.8 222.2 215.5 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 131.0 ) ( 131.2 ) Property and equipment, net $ 91.2 $ 84.3 In fiscal 2021 and 2020, there was $ 19.8 million and $ 16.6 million, respectively, of property and equipment retired which was fully amortized. F-17 4 . Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 % of equity interest in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology, for $ 305 million in cash adjusted for (i) estimated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the closing (ii) estimated indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the closing, (iii) unpaid portion as of the closing of certain transaction expenses incurred by DisplayLink, and (iv) the amount that the estimated working capital of DisplayLink exceeds or falls short, respectively, of a certain specified target working capital set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with $ 3.1 million of the purchase price held in escrow accounts for adjustments after closing and to secure the Seller Parties’ indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 , or the DisplayLink Closing Date, whereupon we obtained high-performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 26, 2021, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The adjusted purchase price paid for DisplayLink was $ 444.0 million. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.9 Short-term investments 94.0 Accounts receivable, net 7.1 Inventory 33.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 9.1 Property and equipment 6.8 Intangible assets 193.0 Right-of-use lease asset 20.0 Non-current other assets 0.6 Total identifiable assets acquired 404.6 Accounts payable ( 5.2 ) Other accrued liabilities ( 9.1 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 18.2 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 32.8 ) Total liabilities ( 67.0 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 337.6 Goodwill 106.4 Net assets acquired $ 444.0 During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, we recorded measurement period adjustments of $ 0.9 million to goodwill comprising of increases of $ 2.3 million in prepaid expenses and decreases of $ 0.8 million to other accrued liabilities and increases of $ 1.4 million in other long-term liabilities for a net increase of $ 1.7 million to the fair value of other acquired net tangible assets. F-18 The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 3.0 $ 82.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 3.0 54.0 In process research and development N/A 51.0 Trade names 4.0 3.0 Licensed technology 2.5 3.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 193.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 11.0% to 11.5%. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of a next generation docking and video interface products for the IoT market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in early fiscal 2023. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DisplayLink as of the DisplayLink Closing Date. As of June 26, 2021, no ne of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DisplayLink acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DisplayLink. The consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 110.0 million of revenue from DisplayLink from the DisplayLink Closing Date through June 26, 2021. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DisplayLink as we integrated a substantial portion of DisplayLink into our ongoing operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 . F-19 The following unaudited pro forma financial information (in millions, except per share data) presents the combined results of operations for us and DisplayLink as if the DisplayLink acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the actual operating results that would have been recorded had the DisplayLink acquisition actually taken place on June 30, 2019 and should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated operating results. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma financial results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits from the DisplayLink acquisition . 2021 (1) 2020 Revenue $ 1,346.9 $ 1,449.9 Net income 72.1 92.2 (1) Includes results of Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income/(loss) included adjustments for historical amortization expense, the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, transaction costs and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were a decrease to net income of $ 1.1 million and $ 33.8 million, respectively. Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business On July 2, 2020 , we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $ 250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020 , or the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years . We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The following table summarizes the adjusted purchase price paid for the Broadcom Business Acquisition (in millions): Cash $ 250.1 Adjustments to consideration transferred, net 1.5 Roadmap products - estimated cost of development ( 25.0 ) $ 226.6 F-20 We entered into a derivative and roadmap product agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Broadcom. The derivative and roadmap product agreement includes the purchase of derivative and roadmap product development services to be performed by Broadcom. We estimated the value of the development services to be approximately $ 25.0 million, accounted for it separate from the business combination, and included $ 10.0 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $ 15.0 million ($ 5.8 million after amortization as of June 26, 2021) in non-current other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The estimated value of the development services is amortizing over the period of time estimated to complete the development or approximately thirty months. The amortization of the estimated cost of development is included in research and development in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In addition, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees and Broadcom agreed to make cash payments to transferred employees as incentive to accept employment offers from our company. We determined $ 3.5 million of value related to these arrangements should be included as consideration transferred, which was partially offset by $ 2.0 million of cash payments to transferred employees as a reduction of consideration transferred. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Property and equipment $ 1.0 Acquired intangible assets 123.0 Total identifiable assets acquired 124.0 Liabilities assumed ( 0.2 ) Goodwill 102.8 Net assets acquired $ 226.6 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which is 2.2 % for order backlog and 13.0 % for the rest of the intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The following table summarizes the estimate of the intangible assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 6.0 $ 93.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 6.0 18.0 Order backlog 0.5 12.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 123.0 The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Broadcom Business assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. As of June 26, 2021, all of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Broadcom Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Broadcom. The consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 100.4 million of revenue from the Broadcom Business Acquisition from the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date through June 26, 2021. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Broadcom Business Acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition into our ongoing operations at the close . F-21 We determined it is impractical to include pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information for the Broadcom Business Acquisition as the business was part of Broadcom and did not have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate. Divestiture In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $ 35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $ 34.2 million. In April 2020, we completed the sale of the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration product line, or TDDI, for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement had a carrying value of approximately $ 33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction for cash consideration of $ 138.7 million. The gain on sale of the assets was $ 105.1 million. Investment In December 2020, we invested $5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a partnership that enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. 5 . Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, and the related accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020 (in millions): 2021 2020 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.0 $ 138.6 $ ( 97.6 ) $ 41.0 $ 138.6 $ ( 76.5 ) $ 62.1 Customer relationships 4.2 125.5 ( 63.8 ) 61.7 81.8 ( 61.4 ) 20.4 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 93.0 ( 14.2 ) 78.8 — — — Video interface technology 3.0 82.0 ( 25.1 ) 56.9 — — — Display driver technology 7.0 20.4 ( 17.5 ) 2.9 164.0 ( 158.2 ) 5.8 Backlog Not applicable 12.0 ( 12.0 ) — — — — Licensed technology and other 4.1 13.0 ( 8.1 ) 4.9 7.7 ( 5.5 ) 2.2 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 3.2 ) 1.2 4.4 ( 2.6 ) 1.8 Tradename 5.1 4.8 ( 1.7 ) 3.1 1.8 ( 0.7 ) 1.1 In process research and development Not applicable 51.0 — 51.0 — — — Acquired intangibles, gross 5.5 $ 544.7 $ ( 243.2 ) $ 301.5 $ 398.3 $ ( 304.9 ) $ 93.4 F-22 In fiscal 2021, there was $ 143.6 million of display driver developed technology and $ 28.3 million of customer relationships retired which were fully amortized. In fiscal 2020, there was $ 47.2 million of fingerprint authentication technology retired which was fully amortized. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 110.1 million in fiscal 2021, $ 51.4 million in fiscal 2020, and $ 74.4 million in fiscal 2019. This amortization expense was included in our consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue. The following table presents expected annual aggregate amortization expense in future fiscal years (in millions): 2022 $ 99.0 2023 86.1 2024 25.9 2025 19.0 2026 18.9 Thereafter 1.6 To be determined 51.0 Future amortization $ 301.5 6 . Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Senior Notes Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date . We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally F-23 subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Senior Notes Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Senior Notes Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 was $ 5.0 million. Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Convertible Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Convertible Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, by and among our company, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances, including (1) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (the Sales Price Condition) or (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day (the Trading Price Condition). Effective April 1, 2021, the Sales Price Condition of our Convertible Notes had been met at the end of the preceding calendar quarter and holders of our notes became entitled to redeem their notes in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Indenture during the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, a total of $ 19.4 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes were submitted for conversion, which completed by June 26, 2021 through a combination of $ 19.4 million in cash and 118,092 shares of common stock from our treasury shares, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 0.3 million which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statements of operations. F-24 Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. This criteria was met by the end of our third quarter in fiscal 2021. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Convertible Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. On June 1, 2021, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes, or Redemption. The Convertible Notes are redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021, or the Redemption Price. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate is equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We have elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement with a Specified Dollar Amount per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of the our common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the Common Stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of Common Stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we paid $ 505.6 million in cash for the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in Common Stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million. As of the issuance date of the Convertible Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Convertible Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Convertible Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount and legal, accounting, and printing costs, pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Convertible Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Convertible Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years , which was partially reclassified to additional paid in capital with the balance charged to Loss on redemption of convertible notes upon settlement in June and August 2021. The contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2021 Interest expense $ 2.6 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 19.2 Total interest $ 21.8 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Convertible Notes as of June 26, 2021 were $ 1.9 million and $ 16.6 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement . F-25 The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of June 26, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 was 2.65 %. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of our company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of June 26, 2021, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants . F-26 7 . Leases, Commitments and Contingencies Leases In fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases. The most significant impact of the adoption of the standard was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2030 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, we recorded approximately $ 10.1 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of June 26, 2021, and June 27, 2020 the components of leases are as follows (in millions): June June 2021 2020 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 31.7 $ 21.0 Operating lease liabilities $ 9.3 $ 6.5 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 24.0 14.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 33.3 $ 21.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Fiscal Fiscal 2021 2020 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 10.0 $ 8.4 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 21.8 2.9 As of June 26, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term was 6.18 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 4.01 %. F-27 Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2022 $ 10.0 2023 5.9 2024 4.4 2025 3.8 2026 3.9 Thereafter 9.7 Total future minimum operating lease payments 37.7 Less: interest ( 4.4 ) Total lease liabilities $ 33.3 We recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis of $ 10.1 million, and $ 10.3 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contingencies We have in the past and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third-party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. 8 . Stockholders’ Equity Preferred Stock We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. F-28 Shares Reserved for Future Issuance Shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of the end of fiscal 2021 were as follows: Stock options outstanding 55,061 Restricted stock units outstanding 1,323,286 Market stock units outstanding 347,027 Performance stock units outstanding 317,392 Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans 3,322,989 Reserved for future issuance 5,365,755 Treasury Stock Our cumulative authorization of repurchases under our common stock repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2021 was $ 1.4 billion and in August 2021 our Board of Directors approved an additional $ 400.0 million and extended the expiration date to July 2025 . The program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock repurchased under this program is held as treasury stock. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had $ 177.4 million of common stock remaining to be repurchased under our common stock repurchase program, and after the additional board authorization in August 2021 this remaining amount increased to $ 577.4 million. During fiscal 2021, we issued 118,092 shares from treasury stock for settlement of early redemptions of our convertible notes and in August, subsequent to year end, we issued 3.5 million shares from treasury stock for the settlement of final redemptions of our Convertible Notes. 9 . Share-Based Compensation The purpose of our various share-based compensation plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward high-quality employees, directors, and consultants by enabling such persons to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in our common stock in order to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and our stockholders and to provide such persons with annual and long-term performance incentives to focus their best efforts on the creation of stockholder value. Consequently, we determine whether to grant share-based compensatory awards subsequent to the initial award for our employees and consultants primarily on individual performance. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2010 ESPP. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. F-29 The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 2,590,000 . The 2019 ESPP authorizes us to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in our company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our company. As a result of approval by our stockholders of our amended and restated 2019 Incentive Plan on October 27, 2020, no new awards will be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding awards consist of our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and our 2019 ESPP. Share-based compensation awards available for grant or issuance for each plan as of the beginning of the fiscal year, including changes in the balance of awards available for grant for fiscal 2021, were as follows: Awards 2019 2019 Available 2019 Employee Employee 2010 Under All Incentive Inducement Stock Incentive Share-Based Compensation Equity Purchase Compensation Award Plans Plan Plan Plan Plan Balance at June 2020 3,190,152 1,412,401 348,780 1,428,971 — Additional shares authorized 1,360,000 1,360,000 — — — Transferred between plans — 264,679 — — ( 264,679 ) Restricted stock units granted ( 803,721 ) ( 676,597 ) ( 127,124 ) — — Market stock units granted ( 101,009 ) ( 101,009 ) — — — Performance stock units granted ( 174,231 ) ( 168,895 ) ( 5,336 ) — — Performance stock units performance adjustment ( 242,651 ) ( 101,892 ) ( 20,449 ) — ( 120,310 ) Market stock units performance adjustment ( 77,534 ) — — — ( 77,534 ) Purchases under employee stock purchase plan ( 220,389 ) — — ( 220,389 ) — Forfeited 615,962 125,720 — — 490,242 Plan shares no longer available for new grants ( 223,590 ) — ( 195,871 ) — ( 27,719 ) Balance at June 2021 3,322,989 2,114,407 — 1,208,582 — Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Cost of revenue $ 3.4 $ 2.1 $ 3.1 Research and development 45.4 32.3 33.7 Selling, general, and administrative 44.3 26.0 22.2 Total $ 93.1 $ 60.4 $ 59.0 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 15.2 $ 6.3 $ 4.3 F-30 Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.4 $ 0.2 Research and development 21.9 9.1 Selling, general, and administrative 4.7 1.8 Total $ 27.0 $ 11.1 We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans, including RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, PSUs, and phantom stock units. We do not recognize a tax benefit upon expensing all or a portion of share-based awards granted to certain executive officers and certain foreign-based employees. We compare the actual tax benefit associated with the tax deduction from share-based award activity to the hypothetical tax benefit based on the grant date fair values of the corresponding share-based awards. Tax benefit associated with excess tax deduction creditable to income tax provision is recognized when incurred. Tax deficiency associated with a tax shortfall is debited to income tax provision when incurred. Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding stock option awards include our 2010 Incentive Plan. Under our 2010 Incentive Plan, we were able to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock at not less than 100 % of the fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant. Option granting ceased in fiscal 2018. Options granted under our 2010 Incentive Plan generally vest three to four years from the vesting commencement date and expire seven years after the date of grant if not exercised. Certain stock option activity for fiscal 2021 and balances as of the end of fiscal 2021 were as follows: Stock Weighted Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (In millions) Balance at June 2020 329,786 $ 69.78 Exercised ( 221,164 ) 69.17 Expired ( 53,561 ) 75.48 Balance at June 2021 55,061 66.68 $ 4.5 Exercisable at June 2021 55,061 66.68 $ 4.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2021, or June 25, 2021, of $ 147.58 . All of the stock options outstanding were vested and in-the-money as of the end of fiscal 2021. Cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Cash received $ 23.9 $ 23.9 $ 5.2 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 8.6 $ 10.8 $ 2.4 F-31 There were no stock options granted in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. There was no unrecognized share-based compensation costs for stock options granted under our various plans. Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. We began granting DSUs in January 2006 and RSUs in 2019. The use of RSUs will cover the meaning of both RSUs and DSUs. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. Delivery of shares under the plans take place on the quarterly vesting dates. At the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory minimum tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. RSU activity, including RSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2021, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs as of the end of fiscal 2021 was as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average RSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2020 1,360,324 $ 42.40 Granted 803,721 81.52 Delivered ( 587,192 ) 41.61 Forfeited ( 253,567 ) 54.67 Balance at June 2021 1,323,286 $ 195.3 64.13 Of the shares delivered, 173,301 shares valued at $ 14.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2021, or June 25, 2021, of $ 147.58 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost for RSUs granted under our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan was approximately $ 61.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2021, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years. The aggregate market value of RSUs delivered in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 48.2 million, $ 36.0 million, and $ 35.7 million, respectively. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, provide for the grant of MSU awards, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the F-32 TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2021, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of the end of fiscal 2021 were as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average MSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2020 391,532 $ 56.93 Granted 101,009 105.83 Performance adjustment 77,534 — Delivered ( 208,275 ) 56.93 Forfeited ( 14,773 ) 54.71 Balance at June 2021 347,027 $ 51.2 82.18 As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 38.17 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2021, we delivered 176.34 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2018 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 35.61 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2021, we delivered the capped out amount of 100 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2019 MSU grants as it was for tranche 2 which cannot exceed a 100% payout. As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 64.62 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2021, we delivered the capped out amount of 100 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2020 MSU grants as it was for tranche 1 which cannot exceed a 100% payout. As a result of Synaptics’ TSR performing at the 76 th percentile relative to the constituents of the Russell 2000 Index for the payout period ended in fiscal 2021, we delivered 200 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2021 MSU grants. Of the shares delivered, 91,956 shares valued at $ 7.5 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value assumes a 100 % payout factor and was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2021, or June 25, 2021, of $ 147.58 . F-33 The fair value of each MSU granted from our plans for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was estimated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions: 2021 2020 2019 Expected volatility of company 53.62 % 45.46% - 52.55% 50.58 % Expected volatility of Index 19.6% - 197.6% 24.64% - 33.44% 23.40 % Correlation coefficient 0.51 0.53 - 0.58 0.51 Expected life in years 2.87 2.50 - 4.00 2.88 Risk-free interest rate 0.17 % 0.26% - 1.52% 2.92 % Fair value per award $131.34 - $175.15 $55.52 - $100.38 $27.70 - $85.52 We amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 16.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2021, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.02 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. Generally, the grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of June 26, 2021 was as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average PSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2020 333,848 $ 41.61 Granted 174,231 68.37 Performance adjustment 84,111 — Delivered ( 201,835 ) 41.95 Forfeited ( 72,963 ) 44.97 Balance at June 2021 317,392 $ 46.8 62.41 We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. Of the shares delivered, 82,240 shares valued at $ 6.3 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 13.4 million as of June 26, 2021, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.09 years. F-34 Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 140.17 per unit at June 26, 2021 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 18.4 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Aggregate Phantom Intrinsic Stock Units Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 789,113 Paid ( 242,692 ) Forfeited ( 143,963 ) Balance as of June 2021 402,458 $ 59.4 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 2019 ESPP became effective October 29, 2019 which replaced our 2010 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP, and previously the 2010 ESPP, allows employees to designate up to 15 % of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lesser of the FMV at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to one year and includes two exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the 2010 ESPP, the offering period extended for up to two years and included four exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, and previously under our 2010 ESPP, if the FMV at an exercise date is less than the FMV at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence. Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows (in millions, except shares purchased and weighted average purchase price): 2021 2020 2019 Shares purchased 220,389 346,502 544,886 Weighted average purchase price $ 57.00 $ 30.50 $ 29.48 Cash received $ 12.6 $ 10.6 $ 16.1 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.3 $ 10.1 $ 2.8 The fair value of each award granted under our 2019 ESPP and our 2010 ESPP for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following range of assumptions: 2021 2020 2019 Expected volatility 43.8% - 57.0% 43.8%-45.4% 43.8%-44.2% Expected life in years 0.5 - 1.0 0.25 - .75 0.5 - 1.5 Risk-free interest rate 0.12% - 1.63% 1.62% - 2.43% 2.43%-2.68% Fair value per award $ 20.82 $ 15.48 $ 15.63 The expected volatility is based on either implied volatility for the expected lives of 0.5 years or a weighting of implied and historical volatility for expected lives greater than 0.5 years. The expected life is the period starting at the enrollment date until each purchase date remaining in the offering period at the date of enrollment in the plan. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields or yield curve in effect for each expected life. F-35 Unrecognized share-based compensation costs for awards granted under our 2019 ESPP at the end of fiscal 2021 were approximately $ 1.1 million that will be amortized over the next 2 months. 1 0 . Employee Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for full-time employees in the U.S. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their net compensation up to the annual limit of $ 19,500 , or $ 26,000 for employees who are 50 years or older. In fiscal 2021, we provided matching funds of 25 % of our employees’ contributions, excluding catch-up contributions. The employer matching funds vest immediately. We made matching contributions of $ 1.8 million, $ 2.1 million, and $ 2.4 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 1 1 . Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 United States $ ( 21.0 ) $ ( 13.5 ) $ ( 40.6 ) Foreign 141.1 172.9 19.8 Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes $ 120.1 $ 159.4 $ ( 20.8 ) The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Current tax expense/(benefit) Federal $ 4.1 $ 0.8 $ ( 4.9 ) State 0.1 — — Foreign 36.1 35.4 20.4 40.3 36.2 15.5 Deferred tax expense/(benefit) Federal ( 0.5 ) ( 5.8 ) ( 8.5 ) State - 0.1 — Foreign ( 8.4 ) 8.1 ( 6.7 ) ( 8.9 ) 2.4 ( 15.2 ) Provision for income taxes $ 31.4 $ 38.6 $ 0.3 F-36 The provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Provision at U.S. federal statutory tax rate $ 25.1 $ 33.5 $ ( 4.4 ) State income taxes 0.1 — — Non-deductible share-based compensation 5.2 3.0 4.0 (Windfall)/shortfall related to share-based compensation ( 3.8 ) 2.1 3.3 Non-deductible officer compensation 6.4 1.9 1.1 Business credits ( 3.8 ) ( 6.1 ) ( 6.1 ) Foreign tax differential ( 6.7 ) 4.9 1.0 Nondeductible amortization — — 0.7 Foreign income inclusion 5.2 0.7 0.4 Deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 3.5 — — Other differences 0.2 ( 1.4 ) 0.3 Provision for income taxes $ 31.4 $ 38.6 $ 0.3 Net deferred tax assets of $ 1.2 million and $ 28.7 million were non-current as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Capital loss carryforward $ 0.2 $ — Inventory write downs 3.9 4.0 Property and equipment — 1.2 Accrued compensation 0.3 3.4 Deferred compensation 0.8 0.6 Share-based compensation 8.8 6.8 Business credit carryforward 39.1 41.3 Acquisition intangibles 6.0 6.6 Net operating loss carryforward 7.2 — Other accruals 4.3 5.2 70.6 69.1 Valuation allowance ( 32.6 ) ( 33.3 ) 38.0 35.8 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 0.9 ) — Interest ( 3.4 ) ( 7.1 ) Unremitted foreign earnings ( 3.5 ) — Acquisition intangibles ( 29.0 ) — ( 36.8 ) ( 7.1 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1.2 $ 28.7 Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2021, a valuation allowance of $ 32.6 million was maintained to reduce deferred tax assets to levels we believe are more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2021 was a decrease of $ 0.7 million. F-37 We assessed our current and future liquidity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and determined not to permanently reinvest earnings of certain foreign jurisdictions. As a result of our determination, we recorded $ 3.5 million of deferred tax liability. We continue to indefinitely reinvest $ 2.1 million of accumulated earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had federal, California, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 0.5 million, $ 4.8 million, and $ 30.6 million, respectively. The California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2033 , if not utilized. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income or income taxes may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership. We had $ 16.2 million and $ 47.0 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2021. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2038 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, increased by $ 2.5 million from $ 20.1 million in fiscal 2020 to $ 22.6 million in fiscal 2021. Of this amount, $ 14.3 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 consisted of the following (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 20.1 $ 18.9 $ 24.8 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions 5.5 3.2 4.2 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions — 0.1 — Decrease due to effective settlement with tax authorities — — ( 6.2 ) Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits — — ( 2.0 ) Decrease due to statute expiration ( 3.0 ) ( 2.1 ) ( 1.9 ) Ending Balance $ 22.6 $ 20.1 $ 18.9 Accrued interest and penalties decreased by $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 and increased by $ 0.7 million representing income tax expense in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 1.7 million and $ 1.9 million as of June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $ 3.4 million to an increase of $ 3.0 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the U.K. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 1 2 .

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread in the U.S. and globally. Governmental authorities have implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic is still uncertain, we expect that it will continue to weigh on our business and consolidated results of operations in the near term and may further impact our financial condition (including liquidity) in the future. We have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, but we are unable to accurately predict the full impact COVID-19 will have on our future results due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, a potential future recurrence of the outbreak, further containment actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and suppliers and other factors. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition, and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences.

The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions. Strategic Relationships We have used strategic relationships to enhance our ability to offer value-added customer solutions in the past. We intend to enter additional strategic relationships with companies that may help us serve our target markets. Sales and Marketing We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions.

This information should be read in conjunction with Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 13 Manufacturing We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom interface products or processed as our ASIC-based solution. After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom human interface solution or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products. We diversify our production capacity through third-party relationships, thereby strengthening our supply chain platform. We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment. Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any one source of supply. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. Backlog As of the end of fiscal 2020, we had a backlog of orders of $256.6 million, a decrease of $20.4 million compared with a backlog of orders as of the end of fiscal 2019 of $277.0 million. The decrease in backlog as compared to those reflected in backlog at the end of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to a lower number of units in backlog for our mobile business at the end of fiscal 2020, largely due to the sale of our TDDI mobile business which closed in April 2020, partially offset by an increase in the number of units in backlog for the same period in our PC business, as well as higher average selling prices of products ordered in backlog in all our businesses. Our backlog consists of products for which purchase orders have been received and are scheduled for shipment on a subsequent date. Most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with limited penalties. Because of the possibility of customer changes in product shipments, our backlog as of a particular date may not necessarily be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. We currently depend on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We currently depend on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in the smartphone market, the tablet market, or the notebook portion of the PC product applications market, or a slowdown of growth in the mobile product applications market because of consumer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer. Net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications has been volatile in the past and may not increase or be less volatile in the future. Net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications, particularly smartphones, has been volatile in the past, and may not increase or be less volatile in the future. Net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications was $698.9 million for fiscal 2020, $900.1 million for fiscal 2019, and $1,021.0 million for fiscal 2018. Our business for mobile product applications faces many uncertainties, including our success in enhancing our position in evolving markets dominated by a limited number of OEMs, and market acceptance of our products over competitive or lower-cost solutions. Our inability to address these uncertainties successfully would negatively affect our business. A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to Sharp Corporation and Fuhrmeister Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020, we had two OEM customers that integrated our products into their mobile products representing approximately 30% and 12% of our revenue and one OEM customer that integrated our products into their PC products that represented approximately 15% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and business. We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult. Our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate could adversely impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers and customers. Any of these public health threats and related consequences could adversely affect our financial results. 17 COVID-19, a potentially deadly respiratory tract infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has spread rapidly and enveloped most of the world, causing a global public health crisis . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Governments in affected countries are imposing travel bans, quarantines and other emergency public health measures. In response to the virus, national and local governments in numerous countries around the world have implemented substantial lockdown measures, and other countries and local governments may enact similar policies. T he United States has temporarily restricted travel by foreign nationals into the country from a number of areas. In addition, the federal government and all of the states in the U.S., have declared a state of emergency or similar disaster declaration, and many states, including California where we are headquartered, have enacted shelter-in-place or similar restrictive orders. Companies are also taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses. These restrictions, and future prevention and mitigation measures, have had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect our future operations. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. Also, some suppliers of materials used in the production of our products may be located in areas more severely impacted by COVID-19, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products. In addition, the severe global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 may cause our customers and end-users of our products to suffer significant economic hardship, which could result in decreased demand for our products in the future and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its duration and ultimate disruption on our customers, end-users, overall demand for our products, supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a more severe adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity). Additionally, weaker economic conditions generally could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets, or our ability to raise additional capital, if needed. We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results. The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy. We cannot assure you that our product solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets. Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets despite the fact that these product solutions are capable of enabling people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of personal computer, mobile computing, communications, entertainment, automotive, electronic and smart devices. Various target markets for our product solutions, such as automotive touchscreens and IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: • the development and growth of these markets; • the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets, the price and performance requirements of OEMs, and the preferences of end users; and 18 • our ability to provide OEMs with solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions. Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future. If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers’ products which utilize our solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline. We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our solutions. Instead, we design various solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers’ products that incorporate our solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales could decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our solutions. We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers, particularly with leading notebook computer, smartphone and tablet OEMs, and expand our relationships with IoT OEMs. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue. In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities, particularly in the smartphone and the tablet market, the PC product applications market, or the IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets. We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results. We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in Asia. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to meet customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results. 19 Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue. We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue. We provide solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of solutions for our OEMs’ products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer’s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer’s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue. We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the PC, mobile or IoT product applications markets, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the smartphone or IoT markets and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins. Some of our competitors, particularly in the markets for mobile product applications and other electronic devices, have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following: • our success in designing and introducing new solutions, including those implementing new technologies; • our ability to predict the evolving needs of our customers and to assist them in incorporating our technologies into their new and existing products; • our ability to meet our customers’ requirements for low power consumption, ease of use, reliability, durability, and small form factor; • our ability to meet our customers’ price and performance requirements; • the quality of our customer service and support; • the rate at which customers incorporate our solutions into their own products; 20 • product or technology introductions by our competitors; and • foreign currency fluctuations, which may cause a foreign competitor’s products to be priced significantly lower than our product solutions. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer. We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential solutions. Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results. We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following: • innovative development of new solutions for customer products; • utilization of advances in technology; • maintenance of quality standards; • performance advantages; • efficient and cost-effective solutions; and • timely completion of the design and introduction of new solutions. Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth. Additionally, our human interface solutions are designed to integrate touch, handwriting, vision and voice capabilities. New computing and communications devices could be developed that call for a different interface solution. Existing devices could also be modified to allow for a different interface solution. Our business could be harmed if our products become noncompetitive as a result of a technological breakthrough that allows a new interface solution to displace our solutions and achieve significant market acceptance. 21 Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China’s overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue and operating results. International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in China, Taiwan, and Thailand by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in China, Denmark, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.K. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing a multinational organization; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; • differing labor regulations; • differing environmental laws and regulations, including in response to climate change; • potentially adverse tax consequences; • possible employee turnover or labor unrest; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; 22 • the volatility of currency exchange rates; • potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights; • political or economic instability in certain parts of the world; and • natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis. If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2020, approximately 12% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including Armenian dram, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swiss francs. If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer. The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to: • successfully hire, train, retain, and motivate additional employees, including employees outside the United States; • efficiently plan, expand or cost-effectively reduce our facilities to meet headcount requirements; • enhance our global operational, financial, and management infrastructure; and • expand our development and production capacity. In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the mobile product applications market, the PC applications market, and the IoT market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer. 23 We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel. Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the United States, could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan. If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage. Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. We have not applied for, and do not have, any copyright registration on our technologies or products. We have applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations of principal or other trademarks in key markets. Failure to obtain registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands, and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the United States. We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements which are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products. 24 We may pursue, and from time to time defend litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These litigations, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology. In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue. We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. Manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts. Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses. 25 We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following: • the potential disruption of our core business; • the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures; • potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business; • costs relating to liabilities which we agree to assume; • unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; • diversion of management’s attention from our core business; • problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies, or products; • risks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience; • failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results; • adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; • failure to retain key customers, suppliers, or personnel of acquired businesses; • the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and • the potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business. Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth. We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets. We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. 26 Transactions relating to our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of our outstanding 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”) would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any such notes. If the Notes become convertible under the terms of the indenture, and if holders subsequently elect to convert their notes, we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions. Additionally, anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Please see Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for more information about our Notes. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, the Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time. On June 26, 2017, we completed the offering of the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million, of which $220.0 million of the net proceeds were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our credit agreement (which we refer to herein, as amended and supplemented, as the “Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders, with a corresponding reduction of revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement to $250.0 million, $100.0 million of which was outstanding as of June 27, 2020. We are permitted under the indenture governing our Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: • making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the Notes, the Credit Agreement or our other outstanding debt from time to time; • risking an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Notes indenture or the Credit Agreement, which could result in the Notes or any outstanding bank debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to foreclose on the assets securing such bank debt; • subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the debt that we may incur under the Credit Agreement; • the LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021 and the replacement rate could be more volatile or more costly, resulting in a higher cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement; • reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. 27 The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Under ASC 470-20, companies are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s effective interest. The equity component of our Notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. In addition, under certain circumstances, the convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash will be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments, requiring bifurcation only if the convertible debt feature qualifies as a derivative under ASC 815 or for convertible debt issued at a substantial premium. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, permitting more contracts to qualify for it. In addition, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted no earlier than the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements . The covenants in the Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; (x) engage in a new line of business; and (xi) enter into sale leaseback transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) restrict the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (iii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. 28 If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, we may incur significant expenses to remediate internal control deficiencies, lose investor confidence and our share price may decline. We are subject to rules adopted by the SEC, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, which requires us to include in our quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K, our management’s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting. We have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, however, we need to maintain our existing processes and systems and incorporate and adapt to new or improved processes and systems as our business grows and changes, including in connection with planned acquisitions. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with SOX is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our, and our acquired companies’ financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with SOX and SEC rules. Further, as we grow our company, including through acquisitions, our internal controls may become more complex and may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to comply with SOX and SEC rules, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate new businesses into our internal control over financial reporting, a failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such new or improved controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to not meet our reporting obligations. If we or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and expend significant management attention. Failure to remedy any material weakness could result in inaccurate financial statements, an inability for the company to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, a loss in investor confidence, decline in the trading price of our common stock, restriction on access to worldwide capital markets, and sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or the Nasdaq Global Select Market. If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows. We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company. In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the “Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 29 We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyber-attacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The accounting requirements for income taxes on certain of our share-based compensation awards may subject our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates to volatility. We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, issued under our share-based compensation plans. However, under current accounting standards, we cannot recognize that tax benefit concurrent with expensing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares (qualified stock options) issued under our share-based compensation plans. For qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, we recognize the tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur and, for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share-based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock, such disqualified dispositions may happen in periods when our stock price substantially increases, and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid-in capital, our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates may be subject to volatility. Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and discourage a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with “interested stockholders.” Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third party’s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: • variations in our quarterly results; • the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance; • changes in financial estimates by industry or securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates; 30 • various market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our suppliers, our competitors, or a potential acquisition of our company; • announcements of technological innovations by us, our competitors, or our customers; • introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us, our competitors, or our customers; • acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or our customers; • recruitment or departure of key personnel; • the gain or loss of significant orders; • the gain or loss of significant customers; • market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole; • short positions held by investors; • new federal and state laws and regulations affecting our industry; and • general financial market conditions or occurrences, including market volatility resulting from geopolitical risks, and rivalries, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, financial market technological glitches and interruptions of trading activity. In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 31 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information on Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol ""SYNA"" since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. Stockholders As of August 17, 2020, there were approximately 126 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 17, 2020 was $84.95. Dividends We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make our debt payments, or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results, and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Credit Agreement also places restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement, see Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Stock-Based Compensation For information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread in the U.S. and globally. Governmental authorities have implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees are able to work from home to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. For those employees that are comfortable returning to an office work environment, we have introduced various return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations, to monitor and assess the health of our employees, including temperature checks and risk assessments, and further require all employees that do work in the office to wear face coverings in public locations. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic is still uncertain, we expect that it will continue to weigh on our business and consolidated results of operations in the near term and may further impact our financial condition (including liquidity) in the future. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to predict. While we have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact COVID-19 will have on our future results due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, a potential future recurrence of the outbreak, further containment actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and suppliers and other factors. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition, and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Our net revenue decreased from $1,666.9 million for fiscal 2016 to $1,333.9 million for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2016, we derived 12.4% of our net revenue from the PC product applications market, 83.9% of our net revenue from the mobile product applications market and 3.7% from the IoT product applications market. For fiscal 2020, revenue from the PC product applications market accounted for 23.8% of our net revenue, revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 52.4% of our net revenue, and revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 23.8% of our net revenue. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Korea, Poland, 35 Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials, logistics, amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology, backlog, and supplier arrangements, manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers, and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers' products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives' commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization is the amortization of the cost of our acquired intangible assets related to customer relationships and tradenames which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to restructuring of our operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount- and facilities-related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on sale of assets includes the sale of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. See below under “Divestiture”. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Divestiture In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020 for cash consideration of $138.7 million. The gain on sale of this business component was $105.1. 36 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity’s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity’s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations within Other Accrued Liabilities as disclosed in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. 37 We invoice customers and recognize a ll of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions . We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We classify shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Inventory We state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 38 Results of Operations The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2020 and 2019 along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages): 2020 2019 $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 698.9 $ 900.1 $ (201.2 ) (22.4 %) PC product applications 317.4 258.9 58.5 22.6 % IoT product applications 317.6 313.2 4.4 1.4 % Net revenue 1,333.9 1,472.2 (138.3 ) (9.4 %) Gross margin 543.1 497.1 46.0 9.3 % Operating expenses: Research and development 302.5 342.7 (40.2 ) (11.7 %) Selling, general, and administrative 127.0 131.3 (4.3 ) (3.3 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 11.7 11.7 — 0.0 % Restructuring costs 33.0 17.7 15.3 86.4 % Operating income/(loss) 68.9 (6.3 ) 75.2 (1193.7 %) Interest and other income, net 7.9 3.9 4.0 102.6 % Interest expense (22.5 ) (21.2 ) (1.3 ) 6.1 % Gain on sale of assets 105.1 — 105.1 nm Impairment recovery on investments, net — 2.8 (2.8 ) (100.0 %) Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes 159.4 (20.8 ) 180.2 (866.3 %) Provision for income taxes 38.6 0.3 38.3 12766.7 % Equity investment loss (2.0 ) (1.8 ) (0.2 ) 11.1 % Net income/(loss) $ 118.8 $ (22.9 ) $ 141.7 (618.8 %) nm – not meaningful The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Percentage Point Increase 2020 2019 (Decrease) Mobile product applications 52.4 % 61.1 % (8.7 %) PC product applications 23.8 % 17.6 % 6.2 % IoT product applications 23.8 % 21.3 % 2.5 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 40.7 % 33.8 % 6.9 % Operating expenses: Research and development 22.7 % 23.3 % (0.6 %) Selling, general, and administrative 9.5 % 8.9 % 0.6 % Acquired intangibles amortization 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.1 % Restructuring costs 2.5 % 1.2 % 1.3 % Operating income/(loss) 5.2 % (0.4 %) 5.6 % Interest and other income, net 0.6 % 0.3 % 0.3 % Interest expense (1.7 %) (1.4 %) (0.3 %) Gain on sale of assets 7.9 % 0.0 % 7.9 % Impairment recovery on investments, net 0.0 % 0.2 % (0.2 %) Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes 11.9 % (1.4 %) 13.3 % Provision for income taxes 2.9 % 0.0 % 2.9 % Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income/(loss) 8.9 % (1.6 %) 10.5 % 39 Fiscal 20 20 Compared with Fiscal 201 9 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $1,333.9 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $1,472.2 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $138.3 million, or 9.4%. Of our fiscal 2020 net revenue, $698.9 million, or 52.4%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $317.4 million, or 23.8%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $317.6 million, or 23.8%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market. The overall decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2020 was attributable to a $201.2 million, or 22.4%, decrease in net revenue from mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase of $58.5 million, or 22.6%, in net revenue from PC product applications and an increase of $4.4 million, or 1.4%, in net revenue from IoT product applications. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a decrease in the units sold (23.5% less units), including the divestment of our TDDI business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (11.8% increase in units) and an increase in average selling prices (which increased 9.7%). The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by an increase in the units sold (4.0% increase in units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (decreased 2.5%). Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 40.7%, or $543.1 million, for fiscal 2020 compared with 33.8%, or $497.1 million, for fiscal 2019. The 690 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily due to a $23.0 million decrease in acquired intangibles amortization that was charged to cost of revenue during the year, and a favorable mix due primarily to our mobile and PC business products which have improved gross margins in fiscal 2020. We continuously introduce new product solutions, that may have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $40.2 million, to $302.5 million, for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) a $16.3 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 15.7% decrease in research and development headcount due to restructuring actions initiated in both fiscal 2019 and 2020 to reduce costs; (ii) a $8.3 million decrease in non-employee services; (iii) a $7.7 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities; (iv) a $4.3 million decrease in travel and entertainment related costs as a result of reduced headcount as well as travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (v) a $4.1 million decrease in supplies and project related costs; which was partially offset by a $2.4 million in-process research and development charge in fiscal 2020 related to an acquisition in August 2019. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $4.3 million, to $127.0 million, for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) a $2.0 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 14.6% decrease in selling, general, and administrative headcount due to restructuring actions initiated in both fiscal 2019 and 2020 to reduce costs; (ii) a $4.8 million decrease in non-employee services; (iii) a $3.8 million decrease in travel and entertainment related costs as a result of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; partially offset by (i) a $3.7 million increase in legal fees ; (ii) and a $2.7 million increase in bad debt expense. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 40 Restructuring C osts. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2020 were $ 33.0 million, which were due to restructuring plans implemented in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 as well as the completion of the fiscal 2019 activities initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The second quarter restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2020 and the restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 are expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2021. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2019 were $17.7 million , which were due to restructuring plans implemented in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019. The first quarter restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2019. The fourth quarter restructuring activities were complete d in the first half of fiscal 2020. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Non-Operating Income. Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net was $7.9 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $3.9 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in interest and other income, net was due to the increase in cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower interest rates late in fiscal 2020. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $22.5 million and $21.2 million, in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued on June 26, 2017. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Gain on Sale of Assets. Gain on sale of assets includes the sale of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Divestiture, to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Provision for Income Taxes. As a result of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted in December 2017 by the United States government, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. statutory tax rate is lower than tax rates in many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. This resulted in an increase to our effective tax rate relating to foreign tax rate differential for our fiscal 2019. However, this was largely offset by the remeasurement and release of various uncertain tax positions. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $1.7 million to an increase of $2.3 million. Fiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 23, 2019. 41 Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters in the two-year period ended June 27, 2020. The following table should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. We have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as our audited financial statements.

This increase reflected cash flows provided by operating activities of $221.8 million, $119.9 million of cash provided by investing activities and $93.9 million of cash provided by financing activities. We consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of June 27, 2020, $213.6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes to repatriate certain of these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2020, the $221.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $118.8 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $51.4 million, share-based compensation costs of $49.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $26.7 million, and a reduction of $105.1 million for gain on sale of assets, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $28.9 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $51.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $43.0 million decrease in inventories, a $31.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $29.1 million increase in accrued compensation, and a $13.8 million increase in income taxes payable; partially offset by a $36.2 million decrease in accounts payable and a $29.9 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. Our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 63 days from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. Our inventory turns increased to six in fiscal 2020 from five in 2019. 42 For fiscal 2019, the $154.2 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss of $22.9 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $74.4 million, share-based compensation costs of $59.0 million, and depreciation and amortization of $35.6 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $0.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $64.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $20.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $4.9 million increase in accrued compensation, a $3.9 million decrease in other assets and a $3.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets; partially offset by a $55.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $27.5 million increase in inventories and a $6.8 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities. Our days sales outstanding increased from 67 days to 70 days from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 . Our inventory turns decreased to five in fiscal 2019 from seven in 2018. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2020 was $119.9 million and net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was $20.9 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of $138.7 million of proceeds from sale of assets, partially offset by $16.3 million used for the purchases of capital assets. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $23.7 million used for the purchases of capital assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was $93.9 million and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $106.6 million. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to $100.0 million proceeds from borrowing under the line-of-credit and $34.5 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $30.2 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market and $9.7 million used for payroll taxes for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to $118.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market and $9.4 million used for payroll taxes for RSUs; partially offset by $21.3 million of proceeds from issuance of shares. For discussion related to the statement of cash flows for fiscal 2018, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 24, 2018. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 27, 2020, our Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to an aggregate of $1.4 billion of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, which expires in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2020, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. As of June 27, 2020, we had $177.4 million unpurchased common stock remaining under our common stock repurchase program. Convertible Debt . On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we issued and sold, and the Initial Purchasers purchased, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. 43 The Notes will mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders, related to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration costs and expenses to 30% from 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75:1.00 from 3.50:1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5:00:1.00 from 3.75:1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representations, warranties and acknowledgments. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 27, 2020, there was a $100.0 million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months. 44 Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our c ompany, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement, which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the Administrative Agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Although consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, including our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, the costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. 45 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2020 (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 633.0 $ 5.4 $ 627.6 $ — $ — Leases 22.8 7.2 10.3 3.2 2.1 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 49.9 43.9 6.0 — — Transition tax payable (3) 8.1 — 2.7 5.4 — Total $ 713.8 $ 56.5 $ 646.6 $ 8.6 $ 2.1 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $20.1 million. As of June 27, 2020, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. This ASU requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires new disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost, loans and available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments, requiring bifurcation only if the convertible debt feature qualifies as a derivative under ASC 815 or for convertible debt issued at a substantial premium. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, permitting more contracts to qualify for it. In addition, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted no earlier than the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 46 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our total net revenue for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 12%, 11%, and 10% of our total costs for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We face the risk that our accounts payable and acquisition-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 3% and 7% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies at June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes by approximately $15.1 million and our net income by approximately $17.6 million for fiscal 2020, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. Interest Rate Risk on Cash, Cash Equivalents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. There have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents subsequent to fiscal 2020. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Reference is made to the financial statements, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, and the notes thereto commencing at page F-1 of this report, which financial statements, report, and notes are incorporated herein by reference. Reference is also made to the quarterly results of operations included elsewhere in this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 27, 2020, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 47 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 27, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2020 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-2. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended June 27, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. F-2 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Evaluation of net realizable value of inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. As of June 27, 2020, the Company held inventories of $102.0 million. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions. Additionally, a liability and a charge is recorded to cost of sales for estimated losses on inventory the Company is obligated to purchase from contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule, cancels its order, or for other factors. We identified the evaluation of net realizable value of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of net realizable value for these inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory and recognition of losses related to outstanding inventory purchase obligations. We assessed the Company’s assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. We also considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. We performed an analysis to recalculate the required write-downs and losses and we compared this to the recorded amounts. We inspected reporting from significant vendors regarding outstanding purchase obligations of the Company. Additionally, we tested returns which resulted from quality related issues of the Company's products during the year and subsequent to period-end to evaluate if additional write-downs or losses were warranted. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.

Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, contingent consideration liability and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 are money market accounts with a fair value of $ 521.1 million and $ 313.7 million, respectively. Fair Value We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. When we measure fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level as follows: • Level 1 inputs are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions, which are incorporated into valuation techniques and models used to determine fair value. The assumptions are consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. F-9 Our financial assets measured at fair value are money markets, are included on a recurring basis, and are level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. As of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 our money market balances were $ 521.1 million and $ 313.7 million, respectively. There were no transfers in or out of our Level 1, 2 or 3 assets during fiscal 2020 or 2019. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. The fair value of our $ 525.0 million principal amount of 0.50% convertible notes due 2022 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the convertible notes as of June 27, 2020 was approximately $ 542.5 million, based on the last trading price of the convertible notes for the period. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy, which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity, limits investments to U.S. government treasuries and agency issues, taxable securities, and municipal issued securities with a minimum rating of A1 (Moody’s) or P1 (Standard and Poor’s) or their equivalent. We sell our products to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services for OEMs, to some OEMs directly, and to distributors. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. The following customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019: 2020 2019 Customer A 21 % * Customer B 18 % * Customer C * 25 % Customer D * 16 % * Less than 10 % Other Concentrations Our products include certain components that are currently single sourced. We believe other vendors would be able to provide similar components, however, the qualification of such vendors may require additional lead time. In order to mitigate any potential adverse impact from a supply disruption, we strive to maintain an adequate supply of critical single-sourced components. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, on revenue from contracts with customers, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. F-10 We adopted the new revenue standard at the beginning of our fiscal 2019, using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods ending after our fiscal 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior reporting periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous revenue standard. Recognition of revenue has remained substantially unchanged under the new revenue standard as compared to the previous revenue standard. Accordingly, there was no adjustment to the fiscal 2019 opening retained earnings. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. In fiscal 2020, there was no material bad debt charge recorded on accounts receivable. There was $ 0.4 million of contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 27, 2020, and $ 0.9 million as of June 29, 2019. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 3.2 million and $ 25.8 million, respectively, as of June 27, 2020, and $ 4.5 million and $ 47.5 million, respectively, as of June 29, 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recognized $ 2.0 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of June 27, 2020, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the ASC, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. F-11 We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are incurred after the product has been shipped . Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. Advertising Costs Advertising costs, if any, are expensed when incurred. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends, and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional bad debt allowances may be required. For the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, credit losses on our accounts receivable were $ 3.7 million and were insignificant in prior periods presented, and we believe that an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to our customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers, and the related assembly, package, and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; acquired intangibles amortization; fair value adjustments associated with acquired businesses; inventory write-downs and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 53.6 $ 110.7 Finished goods 48.4 48.0 $ 102.0 $ 158.7 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write-up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. F-12 Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. Other Assets In April 2017, we paid $ 18.4 million for a 14.4 % interest in OXi Technology Ltd., or OXi. In April 2019, our investment ownership was reduced to 13.8 % as a result of new investment in OXi. Our investment in OXi is included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We determined the equity method of accounting applies to our investment as we have significant influence over OXi’s operating and financial policies. We record our portion of OXi’s net income/(loss) on a one quarter lag due to the timing of the availability of OXi’s financial records. In addition, we amortize intangible assets that we recorded under the equity method of accounting, and such amortization as well as our portion of Oxi’s net income/(loss) is included in equity investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations. As of June 27, 2020, we did not have any material related party transactions with OXi. As our investment in OXi is not material in relation to our financial position or results of operations, we have not summarized information as to the assets, liabilities and results of operations of OXi. Foreign Currency The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. These foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses, resulted in a net gain of $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2020 and a net loss of $ 1.1 million in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Changes in our goodwill balance for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 372.8 $ 372.8 Goodwill allocated to sale of product line ( 12.0 ) — Ending balance $ 360.8 $ 372.8 We have allocated our goodwill to two reporting units. We perform a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or earlier if a triggering event occurs. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of key factors including change in industry and competitive environment, potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, market capitalization, stock price, gross margin and cash flow from operating activities. During fiscal 2020, the sale of TDDI was a triggering event which required us to allocate goodwill to TDDI which was included in the gain on sale of the product line. During our qualitative assessment in fiscal 2020, we determined there were no additional triggering events which led us to performing a step 1 quantitative assessment. We concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a significant amount, therefore, there was no need for impairment. No goodwill impairment was recognized for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. F-13 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the last quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods if a triggering event occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities As of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 Customer obligations $ 29.0 $ 52.0 Inventory obligations 27.9 26.7 Warranty 3.9 4.0 Other 30.2 23.4 $ 91.0 $ 106.1 F-14 As of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, other long-term accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 Income taxes payable, long-term $ 16.4 $ 16.2 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 14.6 — Other 13.0 14.1 $ 44.0 $ 30.3 Retention Costs Retention costs reflect the cost associated with retention agreements entered into with key employees designed to ensure their continued commitment to the support and management of the operations of the company during the transition to new executive leadership. The retention period for employees covered under the retention program continues through November 2020. For the year ended June 27, 2020, retention costs were recorded in the following areas: cost of revenue $ 0.5 million, research and development $ 8.4 million and selling, general and administrative $ 5.0 million. For the year ended June 29, 2019, retention costs were previously reported as one separate line in operating expenses and were reclassified in this report to be consistent with the current year presentation and were recorded in the following areas: research and development $ 1.5 million and selling, general and administrative $ 0.9 million. There were no retention costs in the year ended June 30, 2018. Segment Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of human interface semiconductor solutions for electronic devices and products. The chief operating decision maker, or CODM, at the beginning of our fiscal year ended June 27, 2020 was our Board of Directors collectively, on a temporary basis until our new chief executive officer, or CEO, was hired in August 2019, whereupon our CEO became the CODM. Our CODM evaluates financial performance and allocates resources using financial information reported on a company-wide basis. Share-Based Compensation We charge the estimated fair value less actual forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire underlying award, which is generally three to four years for our restricted stock units, or RSU, awards and stock options, three years for our market stock units, or MSU, awards, three years for our performance stock units, or PSU, awards, up to two years for shares purchased under our 2010 employee stock purchase plan and up to one year for shares purchased under our 2019 employee stock purchase plan . We estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, which is generally three years . The Monte Carlo simulation model that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based MSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Historical and implied volatilities were used in estimating the fair value of our stock option awards. The contractual life of our outstanding options is seven years . No options were granted in fiscal 2020 or 2019. F-15 Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in income on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 2 . Net Income/(Loss) Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income/(loss) per share for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2020 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income/(loss) $ 118.8 $ ( 22.9 ) $ ( 124.1 ) Denominator: Shares, basic 33.6 34.6 34.2 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 1.2 — — Shares, diluted 34.8 34.6 34.2 Net income/(loss) per share: Basic $ 3.54 $ ( 0.66 ) $ ( 3.63 ) Diluted $ 3.41 $ ( 0.66 ) $ ( 3.63 ) Diluted net income per share does not include the effect of potential common shares related to certain share-based awards for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Share-based awards 0.7 2.2 2.3 These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the proceeds received, if any, from such share-based awards combined with the average unamortized compensation costs, were greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive. Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, RSUs, MSUs, PSUs and our convertible notes. F-16 3 . Property and Equipment Property and equipment as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in millions): Life 2020 2019 Land — $ 13.3 $ 13.3 Building and building improvements Up to 35 years 52.7 52.7 Computer equipment 3 - 5 years 41.6 48.2 Manufacturing equipment 1 - 5 years 51.9 63.0 Furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements 3 - 10 years 25.2 25.1 Capitalized software 3 - 7 years 30.8 33.8 215.5 236.1 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 131.2 ) ( 133.1 ) Property and equipment, net $ 84.3 $ 103.0 In fiscal 2020 and 2019, there was $ 16.6 million and $ 16.8 million, respectively, of property and equipment retired which was fully amortized. 4 . Divestiture In April 2020, we completed the sale of the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration product line, or TDDI, for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement had a carrying value of approximately $ 33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction for cash consideration of $ 138.7 million. The gain on sale of the assets was $ 105.1 million. 5 . Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, and the related accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 2020 2019 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ ( 158.2 ) $ 5.8 $ 164.0 $ ( 148.1 ) $ 15.9 Audio and video technology 5.4 138.6 ( 76.5 ) 62.1 138.6 ( 49.4 ) 89.2 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 ( 61.4 ) 20.4 81.8 ( 49.9 ) 31.9 Fingerprint authentication technology Not applicable — — — 47.2 ( 47.2 ) — Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 ( 5.5 ) 2.2 7.7 ( 3.6 ) 4.1 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 2.6 ) 1.8 4.4 ( 2.0 ) 2.4 Tradename 7.0 1.8 ( 0.7 ) 1.1 1.8 ( 0.5 ) 1.3 Acquired intangibles, gross 5.1 $ 398.3 $ ( 304.9 ) $ 93.4 $ 445.5 $ ( 300.7 ) $ 144.8 F-17 In fiscal 2020, there was $ 47.2 million of fingerprint authentication technology retired which was fully amortized. In fiscal 2019, there was $ 8.5 million of fingerprint developed technology, $ 1.3 million of licensed technology and other, $ 0.5 million of backlog and $ 0.2 million of patents retired which were fully amortized. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 51.4 million in fiscal 2020, $ 74.4 million in fiscal 2019, and $ 83.9 million in fiscal 2018. This amortization expense was included in our consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue. The following table presents expected annual aggregate amortization expense in future fiscal years (in millions): 2021 $ 37.5 2022 32.9 2023 20.4 2024 2.5 2025 0.1 Future amortization $ 93.4 6 . Debt Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we issued and sold, and the Initial Purchasers purchased, $ 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30 -day option to purchase up to an additional $ 25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $ 514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase 1,698,400 shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017, and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. F-18 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. This criteria has not been met as of June 27, 2020. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the Initial Purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for fiscal 2020, were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2020 Interest expense $ 2.6 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 18.3 Total interest $ 20.9 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance cost and discount associated with the Notes as of June 27, 2020, were $ 3.8 million and $ 34.5 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders, related to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration cost and expenses to 30 % from 15 % of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75 :1.00 from 3.50 :1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5 :00:1.00 from 3.75 :1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 27, 2020, there was a $ 100.0 million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the year ended June 27, 2020 was 2.75 %. F-19 The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date , subject to certain exceptions. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 2.3 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans . We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021 . Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the Administrative Agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00 As of June 27, 2020, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 7 . Leases, Commitments and Contingencies Leases On June 29, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases. The most significant impact of the adoption of the standard was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. The adoption of this new standard at June 29, 2019, resulted in the following changes: • assets increased by $ 27.8 million, primarily representing the recognition of ROU assets for operating leases; and • liabilities increased by $ 28.4 million, primarily representing the recognition of lease liabilities for operating leases. F-20 Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2028 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, we recorded approximately $ 8.8 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of June 27, 2020, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): June 2020 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 21.0 Operating lease liabilities $ 6.5 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 14.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 21.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2020 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 8.4 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 2.9 As of June 27, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term was 4.09 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 4.01 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2021 $ 7.2 2022 6.7 2023 3.6 2024 2.1 2025 1.1 Thereafter 2.1 Total future minimum operating lease payments 22.8 Less: interest ( 1.7 ) Total lease liabilities $ 21.1 We recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis of $ 10.3 million, and $ 12.0 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. F-21 As of June 29, 2019, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2020 $ 7.4 2021 3.2 2022 0.9 2023 0.3 2024 0.1 Total future minimum operating lease payments $ 11.9 Contingencies We have in the past and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. 8 . Stockholders’ Equity Preferred Stock We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2020, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. F-22 Shares Reserved for Future Issuance Shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of the end of fiscal 2020 were as follows: Stock options outstanding 329,786 Restricted stock units outstanding 1,360,324 Market stock units outstanding 391,532 Performance stock units outstanding 333,848 Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans 3,190,152 Reserved for future issuance 5,605,642 Treasury Stock Our cumulative authorization of repurchases under our common stock repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2020 was $ 1.4 billion, which is set to expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock repurchased under this program is held as treasury stock. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we had $ 177.4 million of common stock remaining to be repurchased under our common stock repurchase program. 9 . Share-Based Compensation The purpose of our various share-based compensation plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward high-quality employees, directors, and consultants by enabling such persons to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in our common stock in order to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and our stockholders and to provide such persons with annual and long-term performance incentives to focus their best efforts on the creation of stockholder value. Consequently, we determine whether to grant share-based compensatory awards subsequent to the initial award for our employees and consultants primarily on individual performance. New Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2010 ESPP. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. F-23 The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. The number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 1,230,000 . The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual is eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding awards consist of our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and our 2019 ESPP. Share-based compensation awards available for grant or issuance for each plan as of the beginning of the fiscal year, including changes in the balance of awards available for grant for fiscal 2020, were as follows: Awards 2019 2019 2010 Available 2019 Employee Employee 2010 Employee Under All Incentive Inducement Stock Incentive Stock Share-Based Compensation Equity Purchase Compensation Purchase Award Plans Plan Plan Plan Plan Plan Balance at June 2019 2,891,466 — — — 2,743,563 147,903 Additional shares authorized 3,508,175 1,230,000 650,000 1,500,000 — 128,175 Transferred between plans — 705,452 — — ( 705,452 ) — Stock options granted — — — — — — Restricted stock units granted ( 742,586 ) ( 320,032 ) ( 92,813 ) — ( 329,741 ) — Market stock units granted ( 359,336 ) ( 140,381 ) ( 187,958 ) — ( 30,997 ) — Performance stock units granted ( 335,966 ) ( 130,110 ) ( 20,449 ) — ( 185,407 ) — Performance stock units performance adjustment 10,242 — — — 10,242 — Market stock units performance adjustment 58,707 — — — 58,707 — Purchases under employee stock purchase plan ( 346,502 ) — — ( 71,029 ) — ( 275,473 ) Forfeited 1,186,383 67,472 — — 1,118,911 — Fungible share ratio adjustment ( 308,424 ) — — — ( 308,424 ) — Plan shares no longer available for grant ( 2,371,402 ) — — — ( 2,371,402 ) — Plan shares cancelled ( 605 ) — — — — ( 605 ) Balance at June 2020 3,190,152 1,412,401 348,780 1,428,971 — — Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Cost of revenue $ 2.1 $ 3.1 $ 3.2 Research and development 32.3 33.7 38.6 Selling, general, and administrative 26.0 22.2 29.5 Total $ 60.4 $ 59.0 $ 71.3 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 6.3 $ 4.3 $ 11.1 F-24 Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.2 Research and development 9.1 Selling, general, and administrative 1.8 Total $ 11.1 We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans, including nonqualified stock options, RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and PSUs, but we cannot recognize a tax benefit concurrent with the recognition of share-based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares (qualified stock awards). For qualified stock awards we recognize a tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur, which historically has been up to several years after vesting and in a period when our stock price substantially increases. We determine excess tax benefit using the long-haul method in which we compare the actual tax benefit associated with the tax deduction from share-based award activity to the hypothetical tax benefit based on the grant date fair values of the corresponding share-based awards. Tax benefit associated with excess tax deduction creditable to income tax provision is recognized when incurred. Tax deficiency associated with a tax shortfall is debited to income tax provision when incurred. Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding stock option awards include our 2010 Incentive Plan. Under our 2010 Incentive Plan, we were able to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock at not less than 100 % of the fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant. Option granting ceased in fiscal 2018. Options granted under our 2010 Incentive Plan generally vest three to four years from the vesting commencement date and expire seven years after the date of grant if not exercised. Certain stock option activity for fiscal 2020 and balances as of the end of fiscal 2020 were as follows: Stock Weighted Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (In millions) Balance at June 2019 1,191,929 $ 59.07 Exercised ( 542,776 ) 44.03 Forfeited ( 8,117 ) 50.70 Expired ( 311,250 ) 74.16 Balance at June 2020 329,786 69.78 $ 0.4 Exercisable at June 2020 329,057 69.83 $ 0.4 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2020, or June 26, 2020, of $ 56.26 and excludes the impact of options that were not in-the-money. Approximately 23 % of the stock option awards outstanding were vested and in-the-money as of the end of fiscal 2020. At the end of fiscal 2020, we estimated that we have 0.3 million fully vested options with an aggregate intrinsic value of $ 0.4 million, having a weighted average exercise price of $ 69.83 and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.7 years. F-25 Cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Cash received $ 23.9 $ 5.2 $ 16.7 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.8 $ 2.4 $ 15.2 There were no stock options granted in fiscal 2020 or 2019. The fair value of each award granted under our share-based compensation plans for fiscal 2018 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following range of assumptions: 2018 Expected volatility 46.2 % Expected life in years 4.4 Risk-free interest rate 1.8 % Fair value per award $ 18.04 The unrecognized share-based compensation costs for stock options granted under our various plans was less than $ 0.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2020, to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.11 years. Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors, and previously our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. We began granting DSUs in January 2006 and RSUs in 2019. The use of RSUs will cover the meaning of both RSUs and DSUs. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. Delivery of shares under the plans take place on the quarterly vesting dates. At the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory minimum tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. RSU activity, including RSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2020, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs as of the end of fiscal 2020 was as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average RSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2019 1,878,853 $ 40.90 Granted 742,586 46.26 Delivered ( 845,550 ) 43.75 Forfeited ( 415,565 ) 39.77 Balance at June 2020 1,360,324 $ 76.5 42.40 Of the shares delivered, 200,587 shares valued at $ 8.4 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2020, or June 26, 2020, of $ 56.26 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost for RSUs granted under our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan was approximately $ 41.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.04 years. The aggregate market value of RSUs delivered in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $ 36.0 million, $ 35.7 million, and $ 21.4 million, respectively. F-26 Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; and the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR—{Index TSR}] x 2)) The payout for tranche one and two will not exceed 100 % and the payout for tranche three will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. In the event the performance for the three-year performance period results in a payout that is less than the combined payout of tranche one and two, we do not claw-back shares delivered in the earlier performance periods. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2020, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of the end of fiscal 2020 were as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average MSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2019 210,732 $ 52.15 Granted 359,336 57.51 Performance adjustment ( 58,707 ) — Delivered ( 23,018 ) 52.39 Forfeited ( 96,811 ) 52.46 Balance at June 2020 391,532 $ 22.0 56.93 As a result of the Synaptics TSR underperforming the SOX Index TSR by 136 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2020, we did not deliver any of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2017 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR underperforming the Index TSR by 34.2 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2020, we delivered 31.6 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2018 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR underperforming the Index TSR by 34.3 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2020, we delivered 31.5 % of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2019 MSU grants. Of the shares delivered, 8,706 shares valued at $ 0.4 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value assumes a 100 % payout factor and was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2020, or June 26, 2020, of $ 56.26 . F-27 The fair value of each MSU granted from our plans for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was estimated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility of company 45.46% - 52.55% 50.58 % 49.16% - 50.60% Expected volatility of Index 24.64% - 33.44% 23.40 % 22.37% - 22.52% Correlation coefficient 0.53 - 0.58 0.51 0.52 - 0.53 Expected life in years 2.50 - 4.00 2.88 2.80 - 2.92 Risk-free interest rate 0.26% - 1.52% 2.92 % 1.72% - 1.88% Fair value per award $55.52 - $100.38 $27.70 - $85.52 $48.22 - $59.19 We amortize the compensation expense over the three-year performance and service period. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 16.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.35 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of June 27, 2020 was as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average PSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 2019 192,618 $ 38.35 Granted 335,966 41.90 Performance adjustment 604 — Delivered ( 61,668 ) 39.63 Forfeited ( 133,672 ) 38.56 Balance at June 2020 333,848 $ 18.8 41.61 We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. Of the shares delivered, 22,521 shares valued at $ 0.9 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 14.6 million as of June 27, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.22 years. F-28 Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 64.18 per unit at June 27, 2020 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 11.1 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Aggregate Phantom Intrinsic Stock Units Value Outstanding (in millions) Granted 953,305 Forfeited ( 164,192 ) Balance as of June 2020 789,113 $ 44.4 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 2019 ESPP became effective October 29, 2019 which replaced our 2010 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP, and previously the 2010 ESPP, allows employees to designate up to 15 % of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lesser of the FMV at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to one year and includes two exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the 2010 ESPP, the offering period extended for up to two years and included four exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, and previously under our 2010 ESPP, if the FMV at an exercise date is less than the FMV at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence. Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows (in millions, except shares purchased and weighted average purchase price): 2020 2019 2018 Shares purchased 346,502 544,886 486,263 Weighted average purchase price $ 30.50 $ 29.48 $ 32.07 Cash received $ 10.6 $ 16.1 $ 15.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.1 $ 2.8 $ 3.9 The fair value of each award granted under our 2019 ESPP and our 2010 ESPP for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following range of assumptions: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility 43.8%-45.4% 43.8%-44.2% 43.7% - 49.8% Expected life in years 0.25 - .75 0.5 - 1.5 0.5 - 2.0 Risk-free interest rate 1.62% - 2.43% 2.43%-2.68% 1.42% - 2.45% Fair value per award $ 15.48 $ 15.63 $ 13.54 The expected volatility is based on either implied volatility for the expected lives of 0.5 years or a weighting of implied and historical volatility for expected lives greater than 0.5 years. The expected life is the period starting at the enrollment date until each purchase date remaining in the offering period at the date of enrollment in the plan. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields or yield curve in effect for each expected life. F-29 Unrecognized share-based compensation costs for awards granted under our 2019 ESPP at the end of fiscal 2020 were approximately $ 0.6 million that will be amortized over the next 2 months. 1 0 . Employee Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for full-time employees in the United States. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their net compensation up to the annual limit of $ 19,500 , or $ 26,000 for employees who are 50 years or older. In fiscal 2020, we provided matching funds of 25 % of our employees’ contributions, excluding catch-up contributions. The employer matching funds vest immediately. We made matching contributions of $ 2.1 million, $ 2.4 million, and $ 2.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 1 1 . Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Act, which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Act contains broad and complex changes to corporate taxation, including, in part, reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested overseas, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As our accounting and tax year is the fiscal period ending on the last Saturday in June, U.S. federal tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that spans the effective date of a rate change to calculate a blended tax rate based on the pro rata number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. As a result, our U.S. federal tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a days-weighted blended tax rate of 28.17 %. For fiscal 2019 and subsequent tax years, including fiscal 2020, our U.S. federal tax rate is 21 %. Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts and recognize the effect of the tax law during a measurement period. The measurement period ended in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. As of June 29, 2019, we finalized our accounting for the tax impact of the Act. However, further technical guidance related to the Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued and, as such, if our interpretation and final accounting are inconsistent with future regulations and guidance, we will recognize the impact as a discrete item in the period such guidance is issued. The Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or GILTI, which is a provision under the Act, imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. GILTI requires an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred, or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We elected to treat GILTI as a period cost and recognize the impact in the period when it is incurred. Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 United States $ ( 13.5 ) $ ( 40.6 ) $ ( 51.1 ) Foreign 172.9 19.8 ( 30.7 ) Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes $ 159.4 $ ( 20.8 ) $ ( 81.8 ) F-30 The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Current tax expense/(benefit) Federal $ 0.8 $ ( 4.9 ) $ 21.5 Foreign 35.4 20.4 14.1 36.2 15.5 35.6 Deferred tax expense/(benefit) Federal ( 5.8 ) ( 8.5 ) 14.4 State 0.1 — — Foreign 8.1 ( 6.7 ) ( 9.5 ) 2.4 ( 15.2 ) 4.9 Provision for income taxes $ 38.6 $ 0.3 $ 40.5 The provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Provision at U.S. federal statutory tax rate $ 33.5 $ ( 4.4 ) $ ( 22.9 ) Non-deductible share-based compensation 3.0 4.0 4.9 Shortfall related to share-based compensation 2.1 3.3 4.1 Non-deductible officer compensation 1.9 1.1 — Business credits ( 6.1 ) ( 6.1 ) ( 4.9 ) Foreign tax differential 4.9 1.0 16.5 Nondeductible amortization — 0.7 1.2 Taxes associated with one-time transition tax — — 44.1 Impact of corporate tax rate change on deferred taxes — — ( 2.7 ) Other differences ( 0.7 ) 0.7 0.2 Provision for income taxes $ 38.6 $ 0.3 $ 40.5 Net deferred tax assets of $ 28.7 million and $ 31.1 million were non-current as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Inventory write downs $ 4.0 $ 12.1 Property and equipment 1.2 1.5 Accrued compensation 3.4 0.8 Deferred compensation 0.6 0.5 Share-based compensation 6.8 9.5 Business credit carryforward 41.3 37.3 Acquisition intangibles 6.6 7.0 Other accruals 5.2 3.3 69.1 72.0 Valuation allowance ( 33.3 ) ( 30.4 ) 35.8 41.6 Deferred tax liabilities: Interest ( 7.1 ) ( 10.5 ) ( 7.1 ) ( 10.5 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 28.7 $ 31.1 F-31 Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2020, a valuation allowance of $ 33.3 million was maintained to reduce deferred tax assets to levels we believe are more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020 was an increase of $ 2.9 million. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $ 1.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2020 and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we had federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.5 million and $ 46.2 million, respectively. The California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2021 , if not utilized. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income or income taxes may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership. We had $ 14.0 million and $ 38.5 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2020. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2026 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, increased by $ 1.2 million from $ 18.9 million in fiscal 2019 to $ 20.1 million in fiscal 2020. Of this amount, $ 12.6 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 18.9 $ 24.8 $ 15.2 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions 3.2 4.2 10.5 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions 0.1 — — Decrease due to effective settlement with tax authorities — ( 6.2 ) — Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits — ( 2.0 ) — Decrease due to statute expiration ( 2.1 ) ( 1.9 ) ( 0.9 ) Ending Balance $ 20.1 $ 18.9 $ 24.8 Accrued interest and penalties remained flat in fiscal 2020 and 2019 and increased by $ 0.7 million representing income tax expense in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 1.9 million as of June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $ 1.7 million to an increase of $ 2.3 million. In February 2020, Altera Corporation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision that reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner , which found that Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost sharing agreement with a related party were invalid. In June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined the writ of certiorari in the case of Altera Corp vs Commissioner. As our tax filing position and consolidated financials are consistent with the treasury regulations and the findings of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 examination by the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our case was reviewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which concluded in September 2019 with no further impact to our consolidated financial statements. Any prospective adjustments to our F-32 unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. 1 2 . Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the mobile product applications market, the personal computing, or PC, product applications market, and the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 China $ 540.6 $ 844.8 $ 803.2 Japan 446.5 234.6 358.6 Taiwan 204.5 239.8 235.2 Other 77.3 64.9 74.9 South Korea 58.3 63.5 67.5 United States 6.7 24.6 90.9 $ 1,333.9 $ 1,472.2 $ 1,630.3 Net revenue from external customers for each group of similar products for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Mobile product applications $ 698.9 $ 900.1 $ 1,021.0 PC product applications 317.4 258.9 257.8 IoT product applications 317.6 313.2 351.5 $ 1,333.9 $ 1,472.2 $ 1,630.3 Long-lived assets within geographic areas as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 United States $ 137.1 $ 149.8 Asia/Pacific 223.5 257.0 Europe 177.9 213.8 $ 538.5 $ 620.6 Our goodwill of $ 360.8 million has been allocated to two reporting units which include IoT and Mobile/PC. Major customers’ revenue as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Customer A 18 % * * Customer B 12 % * 12 % Customer C * 15 % 15 % Customer D * 14 % * Customer E * 10 % * * Less than 10 % F-33 13. Restructuring Activities During fiscal 2020 we initiated restructuring activities, some of which included severance costs which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities to align our cost structure consistent with our revenue levels and one was severance costs related to employees who transitioned with the sale of our assets of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays (See Note 4. Divestiture included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report). The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our consolidated statements of operation. Some of the activities relating to these restructurings are complete as of June 27, 2020. The remaining activities are expected to be complete in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2020 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 25.1 Cash payments ( 19.0 ) Balance as of June 2020 $ 6.1 In August 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring of our mobile fingerprint optical business. The costs for this restructuring activity primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount and related costs. These activities were complete as of June 29, 2019. In June 2019, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to reduce our operating cost structure further. The costs for this restructuring action primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount. Restructuring costs related to these fiscal 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our consolidated statements of operations. The activities relating to the June 2019 restructuring action are complete as of June 27, 2020. The restructuring liability activities during fiscal 2019 and 2020 for restructurings initiated in fiscal 2019 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 17.7 Cash payments ( 12.5 ) Balance as of June 2019 5.2 Accruals 7.9 Cash payments ( 13.1 ) Balance as of June 2020 $ — In November 2017, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to streamline and reduce our operating cost structure and capitalize on acquisition synergies. The costs relating to this restructuring primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount, facility consolidation and related costs. In April 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring to close a research and development facility. The costs relating to this restructuring include employee severance and related benefits and facility closure charges. Restructuring costs related to both the November 2017 and April 2018 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our consolidated statements of operations and were complete as of June 30, 2018. F-34 The restructuring liability activities during fiscal years 2018 and 2019 for restructurings initiated in fiscal 2018 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance Facility Consolidation and Benefits and Related Charges Total Accruals $ 11.0 $ 1.0 $ 12.0 Cash payments ( 8.8 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 9.0 ) Non-cash settlements — ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) Balance as of June 2018 2.2 0.1 2.3 Additional accruals $ 0.2 — $ 0.2 Cash payments ( 2.4 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 2.5 ) Balance as of June 2019 $ — $ — $ — 14. Subsequent Events Acquisitions On July 2, 2020 , we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, for aggregate consideration of $ 250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years . We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. On July 17, 2020 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DisplayLink Corporation, a leader in high-performance video compression technology, for $ 305 million in cash. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. The intent of this acquisition is to obtain performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Export Administration Regulation On August 17, 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce issued final rules that further restrict access by Huawei Technologies (Huawei) and its non-U.S. affiliates on the Entity List to items produced domestically and abroad from U.S. technology and software. The final rules may prevent us from selling products to Huawei entities without a license issued subject to the Export Administration Regulation (EAR). We anticipate applying for an EAR export license, but it is unclear if an EAR export license will be granted. Further, even if we are unaffected by the rule or are able to obtain an export license, Huawei may not be able to source other components from U.S. suppliers, which could indirectly negatively impact Huawei’s demand for our products. At this time, we believe the new rules will not materially impact revenue in our September 2020 quarter, while the longer-term revenue impact remains unclear. During our most recently completed fiscal quarter, June 2020, our direct and indirect sales to Huawei represented less than 10 % of our revenue. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the potential for changes to import, export and economic sanction laws that may adversely affect our operating results. F-35",0000817720,SYNA

Capacitive Force Sensing Technology . This technology senses the direction and magnitude of a force applied to an object. The object can either move when force is applied, like a typical joystick used for gaming applications, or it can be isometric, with no perceptible motion during use, like our TouchStyk, ForcePad, or ClearForce. The primary competition for this technology is resistive strain gauge technology. Resistive strain gauge technology requires electronics that can sense very small changes in resistance, presenting challenges to the design of that circuitry, including sensitivity to electrical noise and interference. Our electronic circuitry determines the magnitude and direction of an applied force, permits very accurate sensing of tiny changes in capacitance, and minimizes electrical interference from other sources. Our capacitive force sensing technology can be integrated with our position sensing technology. 9 Pattern Recognition Technology . This technology is a set of software algorithms and techniques for converting real world data, such as gestures and handwriting, into a digital form that can be recognized and manipulated within a computer. Our technology provides reliable gesture decoding and handwriting recognition, and can be used in other applications such as signature verification for a richer user experience. Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuit Technology . This hybrid analog-digital integrated circuit technology combines the power of digital computation with the ability to interface with non-digital, real-world signals, such as the position of a finger or stylus on a surface. Our patented design techniques permit us to utilize this technology to optimize our core ASIC engine for all our products. Our mixed-signal technology consists of a broad portfolio of circuit expertise in areas such as the following: • precision capacitance measurement; • power management (switching converters, charge pumps, and Low-dropout regulators, or LDOs); • analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters; • LCD source and VCOM drivers; • high-speed serial interfaces; • display timing controllers, or TCONs; • DDICs; • electromagnetic emissions suppression and susceptibility hardening; • SRAM, DRAM, and non-volatile memories; • VLSI digital circuits with multiple clock and power domains; and • communications and signal processing circuits. Display Systems and Circuit Technology . This technology enables us to develop optimized human interface semiconductor product solutions with improved compatibility with their application environments. This technology consists of mobile and large format display semiconductor expertise, including the following functional blocks: • TCONs; • DDICs; • TFT gamma references; • VCOM drivers; • source drivers; • content adaptive brightness control; • contrast enhancement; • color enhancement; • color space adjustment; • gamma curve control; • local area active contrast optimization; • sunlight readability enhancements; • adaptive image compression; • image decompression; • sub-pixel rendering; • video scaling; • edge enhancement; 10 • frame rate control; • selective update; • force, touch and display synchronization; • high-speed serial interfaces such as MIPI DSI and Qualcomm MDDI; and • display power circuits such as inductive switchers, charge pumps, and LDOs. This technology also enables us to develop advanced products that combine the functions of the display and touch sensing systems to enable highly integrated display and touch functionality with improved performance, thinner form factors, and lower system cost. Capacitive Active Pen Technology . This technology allows us to develop a pen that can be used for input on a capacitive touchscreen. As well as generating a signal that allows the touchscreen to track the pen, additional data, such as the pen applied force and pen button states, are also communicated to the touchscreen device. Information can also be communicated from the touchscreen to the pen. Multi-touch Technology. This technology allows us to create capacitive touch products that simultaneously track the presence, position and other characteristics of multiple objects in contact with or in close proximity to a flat or curved touch surface. It enables, for example, the recognition of multi-finger gestures, the tracking of a stylus position while the user’s palm is also in contact with the touch surface, and the simultaneous interaction of multiple users with the same touch surface. Proprietary Microcontroller Technology . One example of multi-touch technology is our proprietary 16-bit microcontroller core that is embedded in the digital portion of our mixed signal ASIC, which is allowing us to optimize our ASIC for position sensing tasks. Our embedded microcontroller provides great flexibility in customizing our products via firmware, which eliminates the need to design new circuitry for each new application. Proprietary Vector Co-Processor Technology. Our vector co-processor technology is designed for use in our ASICs, accompanying either one of our own proprietary microcontroller cores or a commercially available one. The co-processor boosts the ASIC’s computational performance by efficiently processing vectors of data for a range of mathematical operations. This allows us to implement more computationally intensive algorithms within our firmware. Capacitive Fingerprint Sensing Technology . Our fingerprint sensing technology simplifies the system or application authentication process by substituting the user’s fingerprint for the login name and password. Our capacitive fingerprint sensing technology provides for fingerprint authentication by scanning and matching an image of a user’s fingerprint, as well as initial fingerprint enrollment. Our sensing technology also incorporates spoof detection and includes many implementation choices including back of phone, button integration, touchpad integration, and under glass. Voice and Audio Technology. This technology allows us to develop human interface and communication products based on voice and audio interaction. The technology embodies a broad range of analog and mixed signal circuits expertise and audio signal processing algorithms, including: • Noise suppression; • Acoustic echo cancellation; • De-reverberation; • Active noise cancellation; • Speaker protection; • Audio post processing; • Voice activity detection; • Trigger word detection; • Mid-field and far-field voice processing; • Audio digital signal processor architecture; 11 • Audio codecs; • USB interfaces; • High performance audio analog-to-digital converters, or ADCs, and digital-to-analog converters, or DACs; • Audio amplifiers; • Efficient charge pumps and LDOs; • Low power audio processing; • Product acoustic design.

Our video processing technology includes hardware and algorithms to reduce analog and digital noise, convert to different video formats, and enhance color and contrast. Our products include security and secure encrypt/decrypt technology, including secure boot and hardware root of trust. Deep Learning and Neural Network Inferencing Technology. This technology allows us to create and train deep neural networks for audio, image processing, and computer vision functions. Some of our products contain hardware designed to evaluate deep neural networks securely and with low latency. We also have technology that allows us to compress our trained neural networks for more efficient inferencing on our hardware. Research and Development We conduct ongoing research and development programs that focus on advancing our existing interface technologies, improving our current product solutions, developing new products, improving design and manufacturing processes, enhancing the quality and performance of our product solutions, and expanding our technologies to serve new markets. Our goal is to provide our customers with innovative solutions that address their needs and improve their competitive positions. Our long-term vision is to offer human interface semiconductor product solutions, such as touch, fingerprint, handwriting, vision, voice and audio capabilities, and biometrics that can be readily incorporated into various electronic devices. Our research and development programs focus on the development of accurate, easy to use, reliable, and intuitive human interfaces for electronic devices. We believe our innovative interface technologies can be applied to many diverse products, and we believe the interface is a key factor in the differentiation of these products. We believe that our interface technologies enable us to provide customers with product solutions that have significant advantages over alternative technologies in terms of functionality, size, power consumption, durability, and reliability. We also intend to pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions to enhance our research and development capabilities, leverage our technology, and shorten our time to market with new technological applications. Our research, design, and engineering teams frequently work directly with our customers to design custom solutions for specific applications. We focus on enabling our customers to overcome their technical barriers and enhance the performance of their products. We believe our engineering know-how and electronic systems expertise provide significant benefits to our customers by enabling them to concentrate on their core competencies of production and marketing. 12 As of the end of fiscal 2019 , we employed 1,401 people in our technology, engineering, and product design functions in the United States, China, Taiwan, Japan, India, Korea, Armenia, and Hong Kong. Our research and development expenses were $ 341.1 million, $ 363.2 million, and $ 292.3 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Intellectual Property Rights Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other statutory and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may provide only limited protection. As of June 30, 2019, we held 1,875 active patents and 897 pending patent applications worldwide. Collectively, these patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our key technologies, including those for fingerprint sensors, touch controllers, display driver ICs, integrated touch and display controllers, touchpad, far-field voice DSPs, audio codec, multimedia processors and image processors. Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are also protected by copyright laws and applicable trade secret laws. Our extensive array of technologies include those related to ICs, firmware, software, and mechanical hardware. Our products rely on a combination of these technologies, making it difficult to use any single technology as the basis for replicating our products. Furthermore, the lengths of our customers’ design cycles and the customizations required within the products we provide to our customers also serve to protect our intellectual property rights. Customers Our customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMS, automotive manufacturers and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost effectiveness, and on-time deliveries have resulted in our leadership position in providing human interface semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions which are focused in several of our target markets, will continue to position us as a source of supply for their product offerings. Our leading OEM customers in fiscal 2019 included the following: • Dell • Ford • Google • Nikon • Oppo Mobile • Samsung • Hewlett-Packard • Sony • Huawei • Technicolor • Lenovo • Vivo • LG Electronics • Xiaomi We generally supply custom-designed products to OEMs through their contract manufacturers, supply chain or distributors. Sales to Sanshin Electronics Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Wisewheel Electronics Co., Ltd., and Worldshine Technology Ltd. accounted for 15%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of our net revenue in fiscal 2019. We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human interface semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions. Strategic Relationships We have used strategic relationships to enhance our ability to offer value-added customer solutions in the past. We intend to enter additional strategic relationships with companies that may help us serve our target markets. 13 Sales and Marketing We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process. As of the end of fiscal 2019, we employed 246 sales and marketing professionals. We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the United States, Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Japan, and Europe. In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors which are primarily located in America, China, Korea and Taiwan. International sales constituted over 86% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. Approximately 78% of our sales in fiscal 2019 were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major notebook computer and mobile product applications OEMs. Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Manufacturing We employ a virtual manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize a few semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom interface products or processed as our ASIC-based solution. After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom human interface solution or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products. We diversify our production capacity through third-party relationships, thereby strengthening our virtual manufacturing platform. We believe our virtual manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment. Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any one source of supply. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. 14 Backlog As of the end of fiscal 2019, we had a backlog of orders of $277.0 million, an increase of $9.7 million compared with a backlog of orders as of the end of fiscal 2018 of $267.3 million. The increase in backlog is primarily due to slightly higher average selling prices of products ordered in backlog in all of our businesses, partially offset by a lower number of units in backlog for products ordered by customers at the end of fiscal 2019 than those ordered at the end of fiscal 2018. Our backlog consists of products for which purchase orders have been received and are scheduled for shipment in the subsequent quarter. Most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with limited penalties. Because of the possibility of customer changes in product shipments, our backlog as of a particular date may not necessarily be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. We currently depend on our human interface solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We currently depend on our human interface solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in the smartphone market, the tablet market, or the notebook portion of the PC product applications market, or a slowdown of growth in the mobile product applications market because of consumer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer. Net revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications has been volatile in the past and may not increase or be less volatile in the future. Net revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications, particularly smartphones, has been volatile in the past, and may not increase or be less volatile in the future. Net revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications was $900.1 million for fiscal 2019, $1,021.0 million for fiscal 2018, and $1,406.0 million for fiscal 2017. Our human interface business for mobile product applications faces many uncertainties, including our success in enhancing our position in evolving markets dominated by a limited number of OEMs, and market acceptance of our products over competitive or lower-cost solutions. Our inability to address these uncertainties successfully would negatively affect our business. A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to Sanshin Electronics Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Wisewheel Electronics Co., Ltd. and Worldshine Technology Ltd. accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2019, we had two OEM customers that integrated our products into their mobile products representing approximately 24% and 18% of our revenue and one OEM customer that integrated our products into their PC products that represented approximately 11% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and business. We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult. We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results. The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy. 18 We cannot assure you that our human interface business for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets. Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets despite the fact that these product solutions are capable of enabling people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of personal computer, mobile computing, communications, entertainment, automotive, electronic and smart devices. Various target markets for our interface solutions, such as automotive touchscreens, and IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: • the development and growth of these markets; • the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets, the price and performance requirements of OEMs, and the preferences of end users; and • our ability to provide OEMs with human interface solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions. Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future. If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers’ products which utilize our human interface solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline. We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our human interface solutions. Instead, we design various human interface solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers’ products that incorporate our human interface solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales would decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our human interface solutions. We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers, particularly with leading notebook computer, smartphone and tablet OEMs, and expand our relationships with IoT OEMs. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative human interface solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue. In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our human interface product solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities, particularly in the smartphone and the tablet market, the PC product applications market, or the IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets. 19 We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results. We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in China, Taiwan, and Thailand. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to meet customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results. Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue. We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue. We provide human interface solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of human interface solutions for our OEMs’ products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer’s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer’s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue. We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the PC, mobile or IoT product applications markets, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the smartphone or IoT markets and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins. 20 Any movement away from high-quality, custom - designed, feature-rich human interface solutions to lower priced alternatives would adversely affect our business. Some of our competitors, particularly in the markets for mobile product applications and other electronic devices, have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following: • our success in designing and introducing new human interface solutions, including those implementing new technologies; • our ability to predict the evolving needs of our customers and to assist them in incorporating our technologies into their new and existing products; • our ability to meet our customers’ requirements for low power consumption, ease of use, reliability, durability, and small form factor; • our ability to meet our customers’ price and performance requirements; • the quality of our customer service and support; • the rate at which customers incorporate our human interface solutions into their own products; • product or technology introductions by our competitors; and • foreign currency fluctuations, which may cause a foreign competitor’s products to be priced significantly lower than our product solutions. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer. We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential human interface solutions. Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results. 21 We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new human interface solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following: • innovative development of new solutions for customer products; • utilization of advances in technology; • maintenance of quality standards; • performance advantages; • efficient and cost-effective solutions; and • timely completion of the design and introduction of new human interface solutions. Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth. Additionally, our human interface solutions are designed to integrate touch, handwriting, vision and voice capabilities. New computing and communications devices could be developed that call for a different interface solution. Existing devices could also be modified to allow for a different interface solution. Our business could be harmed if our products become noncompetitive as a result of a technological breakthrough that allows a new interface solution to displace our solutions and achieve significant market acceptance. Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 22 Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our human interface product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China’s overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue and operating results. International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in China, Taiwan, and Thailand by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in Armenia, China, Denmark, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, and Taiwan. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing a multinational organization; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; • differing labor regulations; • potentially adverse tax consequences; • possible employee turnover or labor unrest; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; • the volatility of currency exchange rates; • potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights; • political or economic instability in certain parts of the world; and • natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis. If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2019, approximately 11% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including Armenian dram, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swiss francs. 23 If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer. The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our human interface solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to: • successfully hire, train, retain, and motivate additional employees, including employees outside the United States; • efficiently plan, expand or cost-effectively reduce our facilities to meet headcount requirements; • enhance our global operational, financial, and management infrastructure; and • expand our development and production capacity. In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the mobile product applications market, the PC applications market, and the IoT market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer. We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel. Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the United States, could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan. 24 If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage. Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. We have not applied for, and do not have, any copyright registration on our technologies or products. We have applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations of principal or other trademarks in key markets. Failure to obtain registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands, and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the United States. We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements which are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products, or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products. We may pursue, and from time to time defend litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These litigations, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also 25 have to pay substantial damages to third parties, or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology. In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue. We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. Manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts. Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current human interface solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses. We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following: • the potential disruption of our core business; • the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures; • potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business; • costs relating to liabilities which we agree to assume; • unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; • diversion of management’s attention from our core business; • problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies, or products; • risks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience; 26 • failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results; • adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; • failure to retain key customers, suppliers, or personnel of acquired businesses; • the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and • the potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business. Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth. We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets. We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Transactions relating to our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of our outstanding 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”) would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any such notes. If the Notes become convertible under the terms of the indenture, and if holders subsequently elect to convert their notes, we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions. Additionally, anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Please see Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for more information about our Notes. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, the Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time. On June 26, 2017, we completed the offering of the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million, of which $220.0 million of the net proceeds were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our credit agreement (which we refer to herein, as amended and supplemented, as the “Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders, with a corresponding reduction of revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement to $250.0 million, none of which was 27 outstanding as of June 30, 201 9 . We are permitted under the indenture governing our Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: • making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the Notes, the Credit Agreement or our other outstanding debt from time to time; • risking an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Notes indenture or the Credit Agreement, which could result in the Notes or any outstanding bank debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to foreclose on the assets securing such bank debt; • subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the debt that we may incur under the Credit Agreement; • the LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021 and the replacement rate could be more volatile or more costly, resulting in a higher cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement; • reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Under ASC 470-20, companies are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The equity component of our Notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. In addition, under certain circumstances, the convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash will be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected. 28 The covenants in the Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; (x) engage in a new line of business; and (xi) enter into sale leaseback transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) restrict the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (iii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, we may incur significant expenses to remediate internal control deficiencies, lose investor confidence and our share price may decline. We are subject to rules adopted by the SEC, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, which requires us to include in our quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K, our management’s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting. We have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, however, we need to maintain our existing processes and systems and incorporate and adapt to new or improved processes and systems as our business grows and changes, including in connection with planned acquisitions. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with SOX is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our, and our acquired companies’ financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with SOX and SEC rules. Further, as we grow our company, including through acquisitions, our internal controls may become more complex and may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to comply with SOX and SEC rules, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate new businesses into our internal control over financial reporting, a failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such new or improved controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to not meet our reporting obligations. If we or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and expend significant management attention. Failure to remedy any material weakness could result in inaccurate financial statements, an inability for the company to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, a loss in investor confidence, decline in the trading price of our common stock, restriction on access to worldwide capital markets, and sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 29 If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows. We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company. In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the “Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyber-attacks. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyber-attacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyber-attack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The accounting requirements for income taxes on certain of our share-based compensation awards may subject our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates to volatility. We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing nonqualified stock options and deferred stock units, or DSUs, issued under our share-based compensation plans. However, under current accounting standards, we cannot recognize that tax benefit concurrent with expensing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares (qualified stock options) issued under our share-based compensation plans. For qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, we recognize the tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur and, for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share-based 30 compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock, such disqualified dispositions may happen in periods when our stock price substantially increases, and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid-in capital, our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates may be subject to volatility. Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, and discourage a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with “interested stockholders.” Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third party’s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: • variations in our quarterly results; • the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance; • changes in financial estimates by industry or securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates; • various market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our suppliers, our competitors, or a potential acquisition of our company; • announcements of technological innovations by us, our competitors, or our customers; • introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us, our competitors, or our customers; • acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or our customers; • recruitment or departure of key personnel; • the gain or loss of significant orders; • the gain or loss of significant customers; • market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole; • short positions held by investors; • new federal and state laws and regulations affecting our industry; and • general financial market conditions or occurrences, including market volatility resulting from geopolitical risks, and rivalries, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, financial market technological glitches and interruptions of trading activity. In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance. 31 ITEM 1B.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 32 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information on Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol ""SYNA"" since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. Stockholders As of August 19, 2019, there were approximately 133 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of August 19, 2019 was $34.68. Dividends We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make our debt payments, or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results, and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Credit Agreement also places restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement, see Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Stock-Based Compensation For information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities From April 2005 through August 2019, our Board of Directors cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires in July 2021 (which includes the August 2019 authorization by the Board of Directors of up to an additional $100 million of our common stock and extended the expiration date by two years). Subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2019, we purchased 555,663 shares of our common stock for $17.0 million. The remaining amount authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program was $190.6 million as of August 5, 2019. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2019, repurchases under the stock repurchase program were as follows: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program March 31, 2019 - April 27, 2019 — — $ 148,792,320 April 28, 2019 - May 25, 2019 320,000 $ 30.16 320,000 139,141,747 May 26, 2019 - June 29, 2019 1,124,337 28.06 1,124,337 107,595,953 Total 1,444,337 33 Performance Graph The following line graph compares cumulative total stockholder returns for the five years ended June 30, 2019 for (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index (iii) the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and (iv) the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2014. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (PHLX), and the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index include reinvestment of dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period. The historical performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The performance graph above shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. The performance graph above will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of our company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. 34 ITEM 6.

We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, Deferred Stock Units, or DSUs, Market Stock Units, or MSUs, and our Notes. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Our net revenue decreased from $1,703.0 million for fiscal 2015 to $1,472.2 million for fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2015, we derived 15.3% of our net revenue from the PC market and 84.7% of our net revenue from the mobile product applications market. For fiscal 2019, revenue from the PC market accounted for 17.6% of our net revenue, revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 61.1% of our net revenue, and revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 21.3% of our net revenue. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials, logistics, amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology, backlog, and supplier arrangements, manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers, and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers' products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. 36 Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives' commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization is the amortization of the cost of our acquired intangible assets related to customer relationships and tradenames which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to restructuring of our operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount- and facilities-related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Retention costs reflect the cost associated with retention agreements entered into with key employees designed to ensure their continued commitment to the support and management of the operations of the company during the transition to new executive leadership. The retention period for employees covered under the retention program continues through November 2020. The litigation settlement charge reflects costs recorded in connection with certain legal proceedings discussed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Acquisitions and Financing Activities On June 11, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Conexant Systems, LLC (the “Conexant Acquisition”). The Conexant Acquisition was intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective July 25, 2017, or the Closing Date, we completed the Conexant Acquisition. The results of Conexant are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 25, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Conexant Acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. On June 11, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the multimedia solutions business of Marvell (the “Marvell Business Acquisition”). The Marvell Business Acquisition was also intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective September 8, 2017, we completed the Marvell Business Acquisition. The results of Marvell are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from September 8, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Marvell Business Acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the “Initial Purchasers”), pursuant to which we issued and sold, and the Initial Purchasers purchased, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”) in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the exercise of the Initial Purchasers’ option to purchase additional Notes. The offering was completed on June 26, 2017. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates 37 on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity’s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity’s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations within Other Accrued Liabilities as disclosed in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. 38 We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment . Inventory We state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 39 Results of Operations The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2019 and 2018 along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages): 2019 (1) 2018 (1) $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 900.1 $ 1,021.0 $ (120.9 ) (11.8 %) PC product applications 258.9 257.8 1.1 0.4 % IoT product applications 313.2 351.5 (38.3 ) (10.9 %) Net revenue 1,472.2 1,630.3 (158.1 ) (9.7 %) Gross margin 497.1 480.1 17.0 3.5 % Operating expenses: Research and development 341.1 363.2 (22.1 ) (6.1 %) Selling, general, and administrative 130.4 154.0 (23.6 ) (15.3 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 11.7 12.8 (1.1 ) (8.6 %) Restructuring costs 17.7 12.0 5.7 47.5 % Retention costs 2.5 — 2.5 0.0 % Operating loss (6.3 ) (61.9 ) 55.6 (89.8 %) Interest and other income, net 3.9 2.3 1.6 69.6 % Interest expense (21.2 ) (22.2 ) 1.0 (4.5 %) Impairment recovery on investments, net 2.8 — 2.8 Loss before provision for income taxes (20.8 ) (81.8 ) 61.0 (74.6 %) Provision for income taxes 0.3 40.5 (40.2 ) (99.3 %) Equity investment loss (1.8 ) (1.8 ) — 0.0 % Net loss $ (22.9 ) $ (124.1 ) $ 101.2 (81.5 %) (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from Conexant, acquired on July 25, 2017, and the multimedia solutions business of Marvell, acquired on September 8, 2017 (see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Percentage Point Increase 2019 (1) 2018 (1) (Decrease) Mobile product applications 61.1 % 62.6 % (1.5 %) PC product applications 17.6 % 15.8 % 1.8 % IoT product applications 21.3 % 21.6 % (0.3 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 33.8 % 29.4 % 4.4 % Operating expenses: Research and development 23.2 % 22.3 % 0.9 % Selling, general, and administrative 8.9 % 9.4 % (0.5 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 0.8 % 0.8 % 0.0 % Restructuring costs 1.2 % 0.7 % 0.5 % Retention costs 0.2 % 0.0 % 0.2 % Operating loss (0.4 %) (3.8 %) 3.4 % Interest and other income, net 0.3 % 0.1 % 0.2 % Interest expense (1.4 %) (1.4 %) 0.0 % Impairment recovery on investments, net 0.2 % 0.0 % 0.2 % Loss before provision for income taxes (1.4 %) (5.0 %) 3.6 % Provision for income taxes 0.0 % 2.5 % (2.5 %) Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net loss (1.6 %) (7.6 %) 6.0 % (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from Conexant, acquired on July 25, 2017, and the multimedia solutions business of Marvell, acquired on September 8, 2017 (see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). 40 Fiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $1,472.2 million for fiscal 2019 compared with $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $158.1 million, or 9.7%. Of our fiscal 2019 net revenue, $900.1 million, or 61.1%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $258.9 million, or 17.6%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $313.2 million, or 21.3%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market. The overall decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2019 was attributable to a $120.9 million, or 11.8%, decrease in net revenue from mobile product applications and a decrease of $38.3 million, or 10.9% decrease, in net revenue from IoT product applications; partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million, or 0.4%, in net revenue from PC product applications. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a decrease in the units sold (25.2% less units), partially offset by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 17.9%). The decrease in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by a decrease in the units sold (1.5% less units) and a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 9.6%). The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 20.9%), partially offset by a decrease in the units sold (17.0% less units). Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33.8%, or $497.1 million, for fiscal 2019 compared with 29.4%, or $480.1 million, for fiscal 2018. The 440 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily due to a $38.6 million reduction of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition, an $8.4 million decrease in acquired intangibles amortization that was charged to cost of revenue during the year, and a favorable mix due primarily to IoT business products which have higher gross margins. We continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $22.1 million, to $341.1 million, for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) a $19.2 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 9.7% decrease in research and development headcount due to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2019 to reduce costs; (ii) a $5.3 million decrease in supplies and project related costs; (iii) a $3.3 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities; and (iv) a $2.3 million decrease in travel related costs, which was partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in software licensing and intellectual property costs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $23.6 million, to $130.4 million, for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) a $15.6 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 8.6% decrease in selling, general, and administrative headcount due to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2019 to reduce costs and the termination of our former Chief Executive Officer; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional fees; and (iii) a $1.6 million, net, reversal of an accrual for payroll deposit penalties, which were previously accrued and have been reversed due to the completion of a payroll tax audit. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in 41 fiscal 2019 were $17.7 million , which were due to restructuring plans implemented in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019. The first quarter restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2019. The fourth quarter restructuring activities are expected to be complete in the first half of fiscal 2020. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 201 8 were $12.0 million due to restructuring plans implemented and completed in fiscal 2018. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Retention Costs. Retention costs include 18-month retention arrangements with key engineering and management employees. We expect the cost of the retention arrangements to continue through the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Non-Operating Income. Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net was $3.9 million for fiscal 2019 compared with $2.3 million for fiscal 2018. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $21.2 million and $22.2 million, in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively, which represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $525.0 million convertible debt issued on June 26, 2017. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Provision for Income Taxes. As a result of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted in December 2017 by the United States government, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. statutory tax rate is lower than tax rates in many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. This resulted in an increase to our effective tax rate relating to foreign tax rate differential for our fiscal 2019. However, this was largely offset by the remeasurement and release of various uncertain tax positions. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $1.8 million to an increase of $3.0 million. In July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner that found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion to allow time for the reconstituted panel to confer on this appeal. In June 2019, the reconstituted panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of appeals reversed the 2015 Tax Court decision. As our tax filing position is consistent with the treasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. However, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 24, 2018. 42 Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters in the two-year period ended June 30, 2019. The following table should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. We have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as our audited financial statements. This table includes all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the quarters presented. Past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating performance; accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter presented.

This increase primarily reflected cash flows provided by operating activities of $154.2 million; partially offset by cash used in financing and investing activities, primarily related to $118.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $23.7 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, and $21.3 million in proceeds from issuance of shares. We consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of June 30, 2019, $91.3 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2019, the $154.2 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss of $22.9 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $74.4 million, share-based compensation costs of $59.0 million, and depreciation and amortization of $35.6 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $0.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $64.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $20.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $4.9 million increase in accrued compensation, a $3.9 million decrease in other assets and a $3.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets; partially offset by a $55.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $27.5 million increase in inventories and a $6.8 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities. Our days sales outstanding increased from 67 days to 70 days from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. Our inventory turns decreased to five in fiscal 2019 from seven in 2018. 43 For fiscal 2018, the $145.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss of $124.1 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $83.9 million, share-based compensation costs of $71.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $38.9 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $25.2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $49.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $79.5 million decrease in inventories, an $18.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses, a $6.2 million increase in accounts payable, a $5.4 million increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a $22.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $22.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, an $8.1 million decrease in accrued compensation, and a $7.2 million increase in other assets. Our days sales outstanding increased from 54 days to 67 days from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2018 quarter. We do believe DSOs are at normalized levels which are typically between 60 to 70 days. Our inventory turns decreased to seven in fiscal 2018 from nine in 2017. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $20.9 million and $438.5 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $23.7 million used for the purchases of capital assets. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 consisted of $396.7 million used for the acquisition of businesses, $34.1 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $7.7 million used to purchase intangible assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $106.6 million and net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $226.7 million. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to $118.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market and $9.4 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs; partially offset by $21.3 million of proceeds from issuance of shares. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to $514.5 million of proceeds received for issuance of convertible debt, net, $32.3 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $220.0 million used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, and $5.4 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs. For discussion related to the statement of cash flows for fiscal 2017, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 24, 2018. Common Stock Repurchase Program. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $100.0 million of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, bringing the cumulative authorized total amount under our common stock repurchase program to $1.4 billion, expiring in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2019, we purchased 30,934,213 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. As of August 5, 2019, we had $190.6 million remaining under our common stock repurchase program. Convertible Debt . On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we issued and sold, and the Initial Purchasers purchased, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. 44 The Notes will mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. At the end of fiscal 2017, we had $220.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement consisting of $100.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $120.0 million under our term loan arrangement. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we issued $525.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes and utilized a portion of the proceeds from our Notes to retire the outstanding principal and interest balances on our revolving credit facility and our term loan arrangement. At the end of July 2017, we made an election to reduce the commitment under the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $250.0 million as we were able to complete the Conexant Acquisition with available cash. In September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As a result of terminating our term loan arrangement, we expensed the remaining debt issuance costs attributable to the term loan of $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million will be amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 45 The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. As of June 30, 201 9 , there wa s no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as approved by the Administrative Agent, which is currently anticipated to be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate , or SOFR. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, available credit under the Credit Agreement and net proceeds from our Notes will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, including our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, sales and marketing activities, timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, the costs of maintaining sufficient space for our expanding workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. 46 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2019 (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Long-term debt (1) $ 532.8 $ 2.6 $ 530.2 $ — Leases 11.9 7.4 4.1 0.4 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 61.8 49.4 12.4 — Transition tax payable (3) 9.9 0.9 1.8 7.2 Total $ 616.4 $ 60.3 $ 548.5 $ 7.6 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $18.9 million. As of June 30, 2019, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board established Topic 842, Leases (or Topic 842), by issuing an Accounting Standard Update (or ASU) on Leases. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by several ASUs. The new standard requires organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. It also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal 2020. The standard is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach and allows for the adoption of the standard to be applied at the beginning of the most recent fiscal year or at the beginning of the earliest year presented. We expect to adopt this ASU at the beginning of our fiscal 2020, on June 30, 2019. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition and we expect to elect the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We also expect to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient, however, we do not expect to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements as it is not applicable to us. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use (or ROU) assets and operating lease liabilities upon adoption of this standard. At adoption, we expect the primary financial statement impact will be the recognition of additional operating liabilities, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows, but we do anticipate new disclosures about our lease activities. 47 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our total net revenue for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 11%, 10% and 9% of our total costs for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We face the risk that our accounts payable and acquisition-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 7% and 4% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating loss before taxes by approximately $16.9 million for fiscal 2019, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. Interest Rate Risk on Cash, Cash Equivalents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. There have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents subsequent to fiscal 2019. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Reference is made to the financial statements, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, and the notes thereto commencing at page F-1 of this report, which financial statements, report, and notes are incorporated herein by reference. Reference is also made to the quarterly results of operations included elsewhere in this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as of June 29, 2019, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). 48 Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 29 , 201 9 . The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 29 , 201 9 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-2. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 29, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting at item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the F-2 company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.

F-8 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Basis of Presentation We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, which includes devices with voice, speech and video within smart homes, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. Every solution we deliver either contains or consists of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, or video-semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, customer-specific firmware, and software. Our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers include many of the world’s largest OEMs for smartphones, most of the world’s largest PC OEMs, and many large OEMs for voice, speech and video products. The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. The fiscal years presented in this report were 52-week periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 24, 2017 and a 53-week period ended June 30, 2018. For simplicity, the accompanying consolidated financial statements are labeled as ending on calendar year end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, contingent consideration liability and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents and investments classified as available-for-sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2019 Gross Amortized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Value Reported as cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 313.7 $ — $ 313.7 Total available-for-sale securities $ 313.7 $ — $ 313.7 F-9 2018 Gross Amortized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Value Reported as cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 275.2 $ — $ 275.2 Reported as non-current assets: Auction rate securities — 1.5 1.5 Total available-for-sale securities $ 275.2 $ 1.5 $ 276.7 Fair Value We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. When we measure fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level as follows: • Level 1 inputs are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions, which are incorporated into valuation techniques and models used to determine fair value. The assumptions are consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy, as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Money market $ 313.7 $ — $ — $ 275.2 $ — $ — Auction rate securities — — — — — 1.5 Total available-for-sale securities $ 313.7 $ — $ — $ 275.2 $ — $ 1.5 Changes in fair value of our Level 3 financial assets for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 1.5 $ 1.5 Redemptions ( 1.5 ) — Ending balance $ — $ 1.5 There were no transfers in or out of our Level 1, 2 or 3 assets during fiscal 2019 or 2018. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy, which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity, limits investments to U.S. government treasuries and agency issues, taxable securities, and municipal issued securities with a minimum rating of A1 (Moody’s) or P1 (Standard and Poor’s) or their equivalent. F-10 We sell our products to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services for OEMs, and to some OEMs directly. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. The following customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 Customer A 25 % 13 % Customer B 16 % * Customer C * 11 % Customer D * 10 % * Less than 10 % Other Concentrations Our products include certain components that are currently single sourced. We believe other vendors would be able to provide similar components, however, the qualification of such vendors may require additional lead time. In order to mitigate any potential adverse impact from a supply disruption, we strive to maintain an adequate supply of critical single-sourced components. Revenue Recognition Change in Accounting Policy In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, on revenue from contracts with customers, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. We adopted the new revenue standard at the beginning of our fiscal 2019, using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods ending after our fiscal 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior reporting periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous revenue standard. Recognition of revenue has remained substantially unchanged under the new revenue standard as compared to the previous revenue standard. Accordingly, there was no adjustment to the fiscal 2019 opening retained earnings. However, due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, we reclassified certain amounts of incentive items to other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2019, and presented them as part of customer obligations, from the contra accounts receivable. Such information is as follows (in millions): Adjustments reflected in the consolidated balance sheets: As of June 30, 2019 Pro forma as if As reported under previous standard new standard Adjustments was in effect Accounts receivable, net $ 230.0 $ ( 5.0 ) $ 225.0 Inventories 158.7 0.9 159.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 14.6 ( 0.9 ) 13.7 Total assets 1,409.8 ( 5.0 ) 1,404.8 Other accrued liabilities 106.1 ( 5.0 ) 101.1 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity 1,409.8 ( 5.0 ) 1,404.8 F-11 Adjustments reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows: Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2019 Pro forma as if As reported under previous standard new standard Adjustments was in effect Cash flows from operating activities: Accounts receivable, net $ 64.3 $ ( 0.2 ) $ 64.1 Inventories ( 27.5 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 28.1 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 3.6 0.6 4.2 Other accrued liabilities 20.5 0.2 20.7 Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 12. Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in the periods presented. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 4.5 million and $ 47.5 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2019 and $ 1.1 million and $ 31.6 million, respectively, as of July 1, 2018, the beginning of fiscal 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2019, we recognized $ 0.3 million in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. F-12 We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of June 30, 2019, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the ASC, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. Advertising Costs Advertising costs, if any, are expensed when incurred. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends, and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional bad debt allowances may be required. For all periods presented, credit losses on our accounts receivable have been insignificant, and we believe that an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to our customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers, and the related assembly, package, and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; acquired intangibles amortization; fair value adjustments associated with acquired businesses; inventory write-downs and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 and consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 110.7 $ 105.0 Finished goods 48.0 26.2 $ 158.7 $ 131.2 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. F-13 Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. Other Assets In April 2017, we paid $ 18.4 million for a 14.4 % interest in OXi Technology Ltd., or OXi. In April 2019, our investment ownership was reduced to 13.8 % as a result of new investment in OXi. Our investment in OXi is included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We determined the equity method of accounting applies to our investment as we have significant influence over OXi’s operating and financial policies. We record our portion of OXi’s net income/(loss) on a one quarter lag due to the timing of the availability of OXi’s financial records. In addition, we amortize intangible assets that we recorded under the equity method of accounting, and such amortization as well as our portion of Oxi’s net income/(loss) is included in equity investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations. As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any material related party transactions with OXi. As our investment in OXi is not material in relation to our financial position or results of operations, we have not summarized information as to the assets, liabilities and results of operations of OXi. Foreign Currency The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. These foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses, resulted in a net loss of $ 1.1 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 0.7 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Changes in our goodwill balance for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 372.8 $ 206.8 Acquisition activity — 166.0 Ending balance $ 372.8 $ 372.8 We have allocated our goodwill to two reporting units. We perform a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or earlier if there is a triggering event. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of key factors including change in industry and competitive environment, market capitalization, stock price, gross margin and cash flow from operating activities. During our qualitative assessment in fiscal 2019, we determined there were triggering events which led us to performing a step 1 quantitative assessment. We concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amount by a significant amount, therefore, there is no need for impairment. No goodwill impairment was recognized for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the last quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed F-14 group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Other Accrued Liabilities As of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 Customer obligations $ 52.0 $ 26.4 Inventory obligations 26.7 28.8 Warranty 4.0 5.5 Other 23.4 19.0 $ 106.1 $ 79.7 Retention Costs Retention costs reflect the cost associated with retention agreements entered into with key employees designed to ensure their continued commitment to the support and management of the operations of the company during the transition to new executive leadership. The retention period for employees covered under the retention program continues through November 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the retention costs are broken down between cost of revenue ($ 0.1 ) million, research and development ($ 1.5 ) million and selling, general and administrative ($ 0.9 ) million. Segment Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of intuitive human interface solutions for electronic devices and products. The chief operating decision maker, or CODM, was the chief executive officer, or CEO, through mid-March and upon the departure of our CEO, our Board of Directors collectively became our CODM, on a temporary basis. Our CODMs evaluate financial performance and allocate resources using financial information reported on a company-wide basis. Share-Based Compensation We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Historical and implied volatilities were used in estimating the fair value of our stock option awards. The contractual life of our outstanding options is seven years for options granted under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or our 2010 Plan, or 10 years for options granted under our Amended and Restated 2001 Incentive Compensation Plan, or our 2001 Plan. Our outstanding options have vesting periods of three or four years , depending on when they were granted, and we used the simplified method to establish the expected life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. In fiscal years prior to 2018, we estimated forfeitures for share-based awards that were not expected to vest. See Note 9 Share-Based Compensation for further discussion on estimated forfeitures. No options were granted in fiscal 2019. We charge the estimated fair value less actual forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire underlying award, which is generally three to four years for our stock options and deferred stock units, or DSU, awards, three years for our market stock units, or MSU, awards, three years for our performance stock units, or PSU, awards, and up to two years for shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan. We estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, which is generally three years . The Monte Carlo simulation model that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based MSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. F-15 Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in income on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 2 . Net Income/(Loss) Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2019 2018 2017 Numerator: Net income/(loss) $ ( 22.9 ) $ ( 124.1 ) $ 48.8 Denominator: Shares, basic 34.6 34.2 34.8 Effect of dilutive share-based awards — — 0.8 Shares, diluted 34.6 34.2 35.6 Net income/(loss) per share: Basic $ ( 0.66 ) $ ( 3.63 ) $ 1.40 Diluted $ ( 0.66 ) $ ( 3.63 ) $ 1.37 Diluted net income per share does not include the effect of potential common shares related to certain share-based awards for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Share-based awards 2.2 2.3 1.4 These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the proceeds received, if any, from such share-based awards combined with the average unamortized compensation costs, were greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive. Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, DSUs, MSUs and PSUs. F-16 3 . Property and Equipment Property and equipment as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions): Life 2019 2018 Land — $ 13.3 $ 13.3 Building and building improvements Up to 35 years 52.7 51.8 Computer equipment 3 - 5 years 48.2 42.9 Manufacturing equipment 1 - 5 years 63.0 78.1 Furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements 3 - 10 years 25.1 24.1 Capitalized software 3 - 7 years 33.8 35.0 236.1 245.2 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 133.1 ) ( 127.4 ) Property and equipment, net $ 103.0 $ 117.8 In fiscal 2019 and 2018, there was $ 16.8 million and $ 8.2 million, respectively, of property and equipment retired which was fully amortized. 4 . Acquisitions Conexant On June 11, 2017 , we entered into a securities purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Conexant Systems, LLC, or Conexant, a technology leader in voice and audio processing solutions for the smart home, or the Conexant Acquisition. The Conexant Acquisition was intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective July 25, 2017 , or the Conexant Closing Date, we completed the Conexant Acquisition for an initial purchase price of (i) $ 305.4 million in cash, (ii) 726,666 shares of our common stock, or the Stock Consideration, valued at $ 39.1 million, and (iii) the assumption of a $ 3.5 million stock appreciation rights liability, with $ 16.8 million of the purchase price held in escrow to secure the seller’s indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement and $ 7.0 million of the purchase price held in escrow to secure the seller’s adjustment escrow obligations under the purchase agreement. Subsequently, we determined that $ 1.9 million of net adjustments to the purchase price were required, reducing the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred to a total of $ 346.2 million. The Stock Consideration was issued at closing in an exempt private placement. The Conexant Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 30, 2018, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. F-17 The following table summarizes the final amounts recorded for the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions): Cash $ 4.3 Accounts receivable 11.7 Inventory 51.0 Other current assets 3.5 Property and equipment 3.2 Acquired intangible assets 145.7 Other assets 0.9 Total identifiable assets acquired 220.3 Accounts payable 14.2 Accrued compensation 1.3 Other accrued liabilities 9.3 Other long-term liabilities 3.0 Net identifiable assets acquired 192.5 Goodwill 153.7 Net assets acquired $ 346.2 The estimate of the intangible assets as of June 30, 2018, totaling $ 145.7 million included the following: $ 104.9 million was allocated to developed technology and will amortize over an estimated weighted average useful life of 6 years; $ 38.4 million was allocated to customer relationships and will be amortized over an estimated useful life of 5 years; $ 1.8 million was allocated to trademarks and will be amortized over an estimated useful life of 7 years; $ 0.4 million was allocated to backlog and was amortized over an estimated useful life of less than 1 year; and $ 0.2 million was allocated to in-process research and development, which we began to amortize in fiscal 2019 when the work was determined to be substantively complete and we are amortizing over an estimated useful life of three years . Developed technology consists of semiconductor system solutions for audio and imaging applications. We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 9 % to 14 %. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected income and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of Conexant as of the Conexant Closing Date. All of the goodwill was deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Conexant Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Conexant. Marvell Multimedia Solutions Business On June 11, 2017 , the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of the multimedia solutions business of Marvell Technology Group Ltd., or Marvell, a leading provider of advanced video and audio processing applications for the smart home, or the Marvell Business Acquisition. The Marvell Business Acquisition was also intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective September 8, 2017 , or the Marvell Closing Date, we completed the Marvell Business Acquisition for a purchase price of $ 93.7 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. The estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 30, 2018, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. F-18 The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Marvell Closing Date (in millions): Inventory $ 28.4 Property and equipment 5.0 Acquired intangible assets 48.7 Total identifiable assets acquired 82.1 Accrued liabilities 0.7 Net identifiable assets acquired 81.4 Goodwill 12.3 Net assets acquired $ 93.7 Of the $ 48.7 million of acquired intangible assets, $ 29.0 million was allocated to developed technology and will be amortized over an estimated weighted average useful life of 3.6 years; $ 15.1 million was allocated to customer relationships and will be amortized over an estimated useful life of 4 years, $ 0.1 million was allocated to backlog and will be amortized over an estimated useful life of less than 1 year; and $ 4.5 million was allocated to in-process research and development and will be amortized over an estimated useful life to be determined at the date the underlying projects are deemed to be substantively complete. Developed technology consists of semiconductor system solutions for advanced video and audio processing applications. We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 14 % to 32 %. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected income and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset, coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Marvell Business Acquisition assets as of the Marvell Closing Date. All of the goodwill was deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Marvell Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Marvell. 5 . Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, and the related accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2019 2018 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ ( 148.1 ) $ 15.9 $ 164.0 $ ( 116.5 ) $ 47.5 Audio and video technology 5.3 138.6 ( 49.4 ) 89.2 133.9 ( 22.8 ) 111.1 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 ( 49.9 ) 31.9 81.8 ( 38.5 ) 43.3 Fingerprint authentication technology 4.7 47.2 ( 47.2 ) — 55.7 ( 53.7 ) 2.0 Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 ( 3.6 ) 4.1 9.0 ( 3.0 ) 6.0 Patents 8.1 4.4 ( 2.0 ) 2.4 4.6 ( 1.7 ) 2.9 Tradename 7.0 1.8 ( 0.5 ) 1.3 1.9 ( 0.2 ) 1.7 Backlog 0.0 — — — 0.5 ( 0.5 ) — In-process research and development Not applicable — — — 4.7 — 4.7 Acquired intangibles, gross 4.4 $ 445.5 $ ( 300.7 ) $ 144.8 $ 456.1 $ ( 236.9 ) $ 219.2 F-19 In fiscal 2019, there was $ 8.5 million of fingerprint developed technology, $ 1.3 million of licensed technology and other, $ 0.5 million of backlog and $ 0.2 million of patents retired which were fully depreciated. In fiscal 2018, there was $ 20.1 million of customer relationships, $ 4.3 million of fingerprint developed technology and $ 0.1 million of patents retired which were fully depreciated. Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 74.4 million in fiscal 2019, $ 83.9 million in fiscal 2018, and $ 59.3 million in fiscal 2017. This amortization expense was included in our consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue. The following table presents expected annual aggregate amortization expense in future fiscal years (in millions): 2020 $ 51.4 2021 37.5 2022 32.9 2023 20.4 2024 2.5 Thereafter 0.1 Future amortization $ 144.8 6 . Debt Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we issued and sold, and the Initial Purchasers purchased, $ 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30 -day option to purchase up to an additional $ 25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $ 514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase 1,698,400 shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017, and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. F-20 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the Initial Purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for fiscal 2019, were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2019 Interest expense $ 2.6 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 17.6 Total interest $ 20.2 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance cost and discount associated with the Notes as of June 30, 2019, were $ 5.7 million and $ 51.0 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility At the end of fiscal 2017, we had $ 220.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement consisting of $ 100.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $ 120.0 million under our term loan arrangement. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we issued $ 525.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes, or the Notes, and utilized a portion of the proceeds from our Notes to retire the outstanding principal and interest balances on our revolving credit facility and our term loan arrangement. At the end of July 2017, we made an election to reduce the commitment under the revolving credit facility from $ 450.0 million to $ 250.0 million as we were able to complete the Conexant Acquisition with available cash. In September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2019, there is no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As a result of terminating our term loan arrangement, we expensed the remaining debt issuance costs attributable to the term loan of $ 1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date . Debt issuance costs of $ 2.3 million will be amortized over 60 months. F-21 Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as approved by the Administrative Agent, which is currently anticipated to be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants. 7 . Commitments and Contingencies Leases We maintain office facilities in various locations under operating leases with expiration dates from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024, some of which have renewal options of one to five years . Our leased office facilities are located in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States. We recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis of $ 10.3 million, $ 12.0 million, and $ 10.6 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The aggregate minimum rental commitments in future fiscal years for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2020 $ 7.4 2021 3.2 2022 0.9 2023 0.3 2024 0.1 Total minimum operating lease payments $ 11.9 Contingencies We have in the past and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. F-22 Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. 8 . Stockholders’ Equity Preferred Stock We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Shares Reserved for Future Issuance Shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of the end of fiscal 2019 were as follows: Stock options outstanding 1,191,929 Deferred stock units outstanding 1,878,853 Market stock units outstanding 210,732 Performance stock units outstanding 192,618 Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans 2,891,466 Reserved for future issuance 6,365,598 Treasury Stock Our cumulative authorization for our common stock repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2019 is $ 1.3 billion, which was set to expire in July 2019. The program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock repurchased under this program is held as treasury stock. As of the end of fiscal 2019, we had $ 107.6 million remaining under our common stock repurchase program. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $ 100.0 million of our common stock and extended the stock repurchase program through July 2021. F-23 9 . Share-Based Compensation The purpose of our various share-based compensation plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward high-quality employees, directors, and consultants by enabling such persons to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in our common stock in order to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and our stockholders and to provide such persons with annual and long-term performance incentives to focus their best efforts on the creation of stockholder value. Consequently, we determine whether to grant share-based compensatory awards subsequent to the initial award for our employees and consultants primarily on individual performance. Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding awards consist of our 2001 Plan; our 2010 Plan; and our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2010 ESPP. Share-based compensation awards available for grant or issuance for each plan as of the beginning of the fiscal year, including changes in the balance of awards available for grant for fiscal 2019, were as follows: Awards 2010 Available 2010 Employee Under All Incentive Stock Share-Based Compensation Purchase Award Plans Plan Plan Balance at June 2018 2,210,217 1,969,926 240,291 Additional shares authorized 1,852,498 1,400,000 452,498 Stock options granted — — — Deferred stock units granted ( 1,266,131 ) ( 1,266,131 ) — Market stock units granted ( 163,059 ) ( 163,059 ) — Performance stock units granted ( 147,005 ) ( 147,005 ) — Performance stock units performance adjustment ( 1,065 ) ( 1,065 ) — Market stock units performance adjustment 46,663 46,663 — Purchases under employee stock purchase plan ( 544,886 ) — ( 544,886 ) Forfeited 1,328,116 1,328,116 — Fungible Shares Ratio Adjustment ( 423,882 ) ( 423,882 ) — Balance at June 2019 2,891,466 2,743,563 147,903 Our 2001 Plan, which expired in March 2011, was replaced by our 2010 Plan. Option awards that are currently outstanding under our 2001 Plan will remain outstanding until exercised, delivered, forfeited, or cancelled under the terms of their respective grant agreements. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we adopted the ASU for Compensation-Stock Compensation which was issued by the FASB. This update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. Upon adoption of this ASU, we elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur and we applied the accounting policy change on a modified retrospective basis. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, we recognized the net cumulative effect of this change as a $ 24.7 million increase to retained earnings, a $ 1.0 million increase to additional paid-in capital and established an additional $ 25.7 million of deferred tax assets for research credit and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. We have reflected excess tax benefits for share-based payments in the statement of cash flows as operating activities rather than financing activities on a prospective basis and therefore, prior periods have not been adjusted. Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Cost of revenue $ 3.1 $ 3.2 $ 2.2 Research and development 33.7 38.6 33.1 Selling, general, and administrative 22.2 29.5 26.5 Total $ 59.0 $ 71.3 $ 61.8 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 4.3 $ 11.1 $ 16.1 F-24 We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans, including nonqualified stock options, DSUs, MSUs, and PSUs, but we cannot recognize a tax benefit concurrent with the recognition of share-based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares (qualified stock awards). For qualified stock awards we recognize a tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur, which historically has been up to several years after vesting and in a period when our stock price substantially increases. We determine excess tax benefit using the long-haul method in which we compare the actual tax benefit associated with the tax deduction from share-based award activity to the hypothetical tax benefit based on the grant date fair values of the corresponding share-based awards. Tax benefit associated with excess tax deduction creditable to income tax provision is recognized when incurred. Tax deficiency associated with a tax shortfall is debited to income tax provision when incurred. Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding stock option awards include our 2001 Plan and our 2010 Plan. Under our 2010 Plan, we may grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock at not less than 100 % of the fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant. Options granted under our 2010 Plan generally vest three to four years from the vesting commencement date and expire seven years after the date of grant if not exercised. Certain stock option activity for fiscal 2019 and balances as of the end of fiscal 2019 were as follows: Stock Weighted Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (In millions) Balance at June 2018 1,618,209 $ 57.14 Exercised ( 177,823 ) 29.16 Forfeited ( 57,091 ) 52.96 Expired ( 191,366 ) 72.40 Balance at June 2019 1,191,929 59.07 $ 0.4 Exercisable at June 2019 1,163,841 59.23 $ 0.4 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2019, or June 28, 2019, of $ 29.14 and excludes the impact of options that were not in-the-money. Approximately 8 % of the stock option awards outstanding were vested and in-the-money as of the end of fiscal 2019. At the end of fiscal 2019, we estimated that we have 1.2 million fully vested options with an aggregate intrinsic value of $ 0.4 million, having a weighted average exercise price of $ 59.07 and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.8 years. The weighted average remaining contractual term for the options exercisable is approximately 1.7 years. Cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Cash received $ 5.2 $ 16.7 $ 10.7 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 2.4 $ 15.2 $ 12.3 F-25 There were no stock options granted in fiscal 2019. The fair value of each award granted under our share-based compensation plans for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following range of assumptions: 2018 2017 Expected volatility 46.2 % 45.2% - 48.3% Expected life in years 4.4 3.8 - 4.6 Risk-free interest rate 1.8 % 1.03% - 1.94% Fair value per award $ 18.04 $ 21.08 The unrecognized share-based compensation costs for stock options granted under our various plans were approximately $ 0.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2019, to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.71 years. Deferred Stock Units Our 2010 Plan provides for the grant of DSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A DSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the DSU grant agreement. We began granting DSUs in January 2006. DSUs granted under our 2010 Plan generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. Delivery of shares under the plan takes place on the quarterly vesting dates. At the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory minimum tax withholding by delivering a net quantity of shares. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder. An election to defer delivery of the underlying shares for unvested DSUs can be made by the grantee provided the deferral election is made at least one year before vesting and the deferral period is at least five years from the scheduled delivery date. DSU activity, including DSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2019, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of DSUs as of the end of fiscal 2019 was as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average DSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 30, 2018 1,853,558 $ 49.75 Granted 1,266,131 36.90 Delivered ( 729,564 ) 54.67 Forfeited ( 511,272 ) 43.49 Balance at June 30, 2019 1,878,853 $ 54.7 40.90 Of the shares delivered, 172,363 shares valued at $ 6.7 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2019, or June 28, 2019, of $ 29.14 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost for DSUs granted under our 2010 Plan was approximately $ 50.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.84 years. The aggregate market value of DSUs delivered in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $ 35.7 million, $ 21.4 million, and $ 24.3 million, respectively. Market Stock Units Our 2010 Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. F-26 We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; and the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018 and relative to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX Index, for grants made prior to fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR—{SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR}] x 2)) The payout for tranche one and two will not exceed 100 % and the payout for tranche three will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2019, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of the end of fiscal 2019 were as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average MSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 30, 2018 354,726 $ 59.37 Granted 163,059 46.69 Performance adjustment ( 46,663 ) — Delivered ( 92,202 ) 53.33 Forfeited ( 168,188 ) 59.41 Balance at June 30, 2019 210,732 $ 6.1 52.15 As a result of the Synaptics TSR underperforming the SOX Index TSR by 154 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2019, we did no t deliver any of the targeted shares underlying the October 2015 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR underperforming the SOX Index TSR by 90 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2019, we did not deliver any of the targeted shares underlying the October 2016 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the SOX Index TSR by 11 percentage points for the payout period ended in fiscal 2019, we delivered 100 % of the targeted shares underlying the October and December 2017 MSU grants. Of the shares delivered, 33,981 shares valued at $ 1.3 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value assumes a 100 % payout factor and was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2019, or June 28, 2019, of $ 29.14 . F-27 The fair value of each MSU granted from our plans for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was estimated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions: 2019 2018 2017 Expected volatility of company 50.58 % 49.16% - 50.60% 52.54 % Expected volatility of SOX index 23.40 % 22.37% - 22.52% 21.23 % Correlation coefficient 0.51 0.52 - 0.53 0.45 Expected life in years 2.88 2.80 - 2.92 2.92 Risk-free interest rate 2.92 % 1.72% - 1.88% 1.01 % Fair value per award $27.70 - $85.52 $48.22 - $59.19 $ 67.51 We amortize the compensation expense over the three-year performance and service period. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 7.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.94 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2010 Plan provides for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of June 30, 2019 was as follows: Aggregate Weighted Intrinsic Average PSU Awards Value Grant Date Outstanding (in millions) Fair Value Balance at June 30, 2018 294,541 $ 39.48 Granted 147,005 35.41 Performance adjustment 1,065 — Delivered ( 92,470 ) 39.54 Forfeited ( 157,523 ) 37.00 Balance at June 30, 2019 192,618 $ 5.6 38.35 F-28 We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. Of the shares delivered, 36,332 shares valued at $ 1.4 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 2.4 million as of June 30, 201 9 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.03 years . Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 2010 ESPP, became effective on January 1, 2011. The 2010 ESPP allows employees to designate up to 15 % of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lesser of the FMV at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. The offering period extends for up to two years and includes four exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2010 ESPP, if the FMV at an exercise date is less than the FMV at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new two-year offering period will commence. Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except shares purchased and weighted average purchase price): 2019 2018 2017 Shares purchased 544,886 486,263 302,085 Weighted average purchase price $ 29.48 $ 32.07 $ 46.74 Cash received $ 16.1 $ 15.6 $ 14.1 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 2.8 $ 3.9 $ 2.7 The fair value of each award granted under our 2010 ESPP for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following range of assumptions: 2019 2018 2017 Expected volatility 43.8%-44.23% 43.7% - 49.8% 38.4% - 54.9% Expected life in years 0.5 - 1.5 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 Risk-free interest rate 2.43%-2.68% 1.42% - 2.45% 0.62% - 1.20% Fair value per award $ 15.63 $ 13.54 $ 20.44 The expected volatility is based on either implied volatility for the expected lives of 0.5 years or a weighting of implied and historical volatility for expected lives greater than 0.5 years. The expected life is the period starting at the enrollment date until each purchase date remaining in the offering period at the date of enrollment in the plan. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields or yield curve in effect for each expected life. Unrecognized share-based compensation costs for awards granted under our 2010 ESPP at the end of fiscal 2019 were approximately $ 3.4 million that will be amortized over the next 4 months. 1 0 . Employee Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for full-time employees in the United States. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their net compensation up to the annual limit of $ 19,000 , or $ 25,000 for employees who are 50 years or older. In fiscal 2019, we provided matching funds of 25 % of our employees’ contributions, excluding catch-up contributions. The employer matching funds vest 25 % over four years and are fully vested at the end of the fourth year. We made matching contributions of $ 2.4 million, $ 2.8 million, and $ 2.3 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. F-29 1 1 . Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Act, which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Act contains broad and complex changes to corporate taxation, including, in part, reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As our accounting and tax year is the fiscal period ending on the last Saturday in June, U.S. federal tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that spans the effective date of a rate change to calculate a blended tax rate based on the pro rata number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. As a result, our U.S. federal tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a days-weighted blended tax rate of 28.17 %. For fiscal 2019 and subsequent tax years, our U.S. federal tax rate is 21 %. Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts and recognize the effect of the tax law during a measurement period. The measurement period ended in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. As of June 30, 2019, we have finalized our accounting for the tax impact of the Act. However, further technical guidance related to the Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued and, as such, if our interpretation and final accounting are inconsistent with future regulations and guidance, we will recognize the impact as a discrete item in the period such guidance is issued. The Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or GILTI, which is a provision under the Act, imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. GILTI requires an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred, or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We elected to treat GILTI as a period cost and recognize the impact in the period when it is incurred. Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 United States $ ( 40.6 ) $ ( 51.1 ) $ ( 10.1 ) Foreign 19.8 ( 30.7 ) 71.4 Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes $ ( 20.8 ) $ ( 81.8 ) $ 61.3 The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Current tax expense/(benefit) Federal $ ( 4.9 ) $ 21.5 $ 9.6 Foreign 20.4 14.1 25.5 15.5 35.6 35.1 Deferred tax expense/(benefit) Federal ( 8.5 ) 14.4 ( 10.6 ) Foreign ( 6.7 ) ( 9.5 ) ( 12.3 ) ( 15.2 ) 4.9 ( 22.9 ) Provision for income taxes $ 0.3 $ 40.5 $ 12.2 F-30 The provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Provision at U.S. federal statutory tax rate $ ( 4.4 ) $ ( 22.9 ) $ 21.5 Qualified stock options 4.0 4.9 5.5 Shortfall related to share-based compensation 3.3 4.1 — Non-deductible officer compensation 1.1 — — Business credits ( 6.1 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 3.6 ) Foreign tax differential 1.0 16.5 ( 13.2 ) Non-deductible portion of contingent consideration — — 0.9 Change in valuation allowance — — ( 0.8 ) Nondeductible amortization 0.7 1.2 1.6 Taxes associated with one-time transition tax — 44.1 — Impact of corporate tax rate change on deferred taxes — ( 2.7 ) — Other differences 0.7 0.2 0.3 Provision for income taxes $ 0.3 $ 40.5 $ 12.2 Net deferred tax assets of $ 31.1 million and $ 15.9 million were non-current as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Investment writedowns $ — $ 1.1 Inventory writedowns 12.1 11.6 Property and equipment 1.5 1.9 Accrued compensation 0.8 0.1 Deferred compensation 0.5 0.6 Share-based compensation 9.5 11.1 Business credit carryforward 37.3 25.3 Acquisition intangibles 7.0 0.6 Other accruals 3.3 1.6 72.0 53.9 Valuation allowance ( 30.4 ) ( 23.3 ) 41.6 30.6 Deferred tax liabilities: Interest ( 10.5 ) ( 14.7 ) ( 10.5 ) ( 14.7 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 31.1 $ 15.9 Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2019, a valuation allowance of $ 30.4 million is maintained to reduce deferred tax assets to levels we believe are more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2019 was an increase of $ 7.1 million. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $ 859.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2019 and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. F-31 As of the end of fiscal 2019, we had federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of approximately zero and $ 33.2 million, respectively. The California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2020 , if not utilized. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income or income taxes may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership. We had $ 11.0 million and $ 37.8 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2019. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2026 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $ 0.8 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward available to offset future federal tax liabilities with no expiration or potentially refundable under current tax laws. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, decreased by $ 5.9 million from $ 24.8 million in fiscal 2018 to $ 18.9 million in fiscal 2019. Of this amount, $ 13.1 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Beginning balance $ 24.8 $ 15.2 $ 13.4 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions 4.2 10.5 2.5 Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions — — 0.1 Decrease due to effective settlement with tax authorities ( 6.2 ) — — Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits ( 2.0 ) — — Decrease due to statute expiration ( 1.9 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 0.8 ) Ending Balance $ 18.9 $ 24.8 $ 15.2 Accrued interest and penalties remained flat, increased by $ 0.7 million, and decreased by $ 0.2 million representing income tax expense or benefit, in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 1.9 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $ 1.8 million to an increase of $ 3.0 million. In July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner that found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion to allow time for the reconstituted panel to confer on this appeal. In June 2019, the reconstituted panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of appeals reversed the 2015 Tax Court decision. As our tax filing position is consistent with the treasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. However, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2013 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and 2015 examination by the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our case is pending review by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which we anticipate will conclude in our fiscal 2020. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. 1 2 .
