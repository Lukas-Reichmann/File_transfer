These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 109.3 Provisions charged to earnings 5.4 Write-offs ( 10.5 ) Currency impact and other ( 1.4 ) Balance, September 30, 2023 $ 102.8 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. 9 We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. During the third quarter of 2023, we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of each reporting unit at the time of our annual impairmen t test was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit. The Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment, had a fair value that approximated its carrying value. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed at our 2023 annual impairment test included a discount rate of 12.5 %, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from - 1.2 % to 6.4 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.2 %. Management closely monitors the results of the reporting unit and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate at the time of our annual impairment test, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. The performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for impairment in the Netherlands reporting unit. If management determines that the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, or if there is continued deterioration in the market due to macroeconomic conditions, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 54.4 as of September 30, 2023, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by 20 % or more, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2023 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024 . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to September 30, 2023, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. 10 Our deferred revenue was $ 31.5 as of September 30, 2023 and $ 35.6 as of December 31, 2022.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and performance share units. Lower expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from lower estimated payouts related to performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 1.8 and $ 0.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 18.1 , which primarily represents a consideration payment for the acquisition of Tingari, a talent solutions company in France, and contingent consideration payments associated with previous acquisitions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On September 29, 2023, we disposed of our Philippines business in our APME segment for total consideration of $ 6.5 . In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $ 1.3 . 12 (6) Restructuring Costs During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded $ 47.1 in severance restructuring costs and $ 12.1 in other restructuring costs, primarily consisting of professional and other fees associated with restructuring activities. We did not record any restructuring costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made payments of $ 31.7 out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance, office closures and consolidations, and professional and other fees related to restructuring in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 40.7 reserve will be paid by the end of 2024. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below: Americas (a) Southern Europe (b) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 11.0 $ 0.2 $ — $ 13.2 Severance costs 7.6 9.3 26.5 3.3 0.4 47.1 Other costs — 0.9 11.2 — — 12.1 Costs paid ( 4.4 ) ( 3.3 ) ( 21.1 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 31.7 ) Balance, September 30, 2023 $ 4.2 $ 7.9 $ 27.6 $ 1.0 $ — $ 40.7 In July 2023, we announced our decision to wind down our Proservia managed services business in Germany. We expect to record significant restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to this wind down. A significant portion of the restructuring costs represent payments to impacted employees. A component of these payments are severance related costs amounting to $ 32.2 agreed with the applicable work councils in October 2023, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Communications are continuing with impacted parties, and we expect additional restructuring costs to be recorded through the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 44.7 % for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 29.0 % for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was unfavorably impacted by a lower level of pre-tax earnings with a less beneficial mix due in part to restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75 % to 0.375 % effective January 1, 2023 and the effective settlement of an income tax audit. In certain countries in which we recorded restructuring costs, we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to the recognition of valuation allowances against anticipated tax losses. The 44.7 % effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, the French business tax, and the overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.6 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 30.3 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was unfavorably impacted by a lower level of pre-tax earnings with a less beneficial mix due in part to restructuring costs recorded in the second and third quarters of 2023 and favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75 % to 0.375 % effective January 1, 2023 and the effective settlement of an income tax audit. The 33.6 % effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, the French business tax, and the overall mix of earnings. As of September 30, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 33.8 . If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 81.6 . In the third quarter of 2023, we effectively settled an income tax audit and reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $ 45.3 , most of which did not impact tax expense. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2016 through 2023 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of September 30, 2023, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 13 (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 30.3 $ 111.3 $ 173.3 $ 325.1 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 49.5 51.7 50.1 52.6 Effect of dilutive securities - share-based awards 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.7 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 50.1 52.3 50.7 53.3 Net earnings per share - basic $ 0.61 $ 2.15 $ 3.46 $ 6.18 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 0.60 $ 2.13 $ 3.42 $ 6.10 There were 0.6 million and 0.7 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. There were 0.6 million and 0.5 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive.

During 2023, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 20.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. 15 (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Foreign currency translation $ ( 362.5 ) $ ( 369.7 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans, net of income taxes of $ 19.1 on both dates ( 133.4 ) ( 132.8 ) Gain on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 4.8 ) and $( 5.3 ), respectively 25.5 53.4 Gain on interest rate swap, net of income taxes of $ 0.4 on both dates 1.1 1.4 Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 20.1 ) and $( 20.4 ), respectively ( 14.5 ) ( 12.2 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.8 and $ 1.9 , respectively 0.7 1.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 483.1 ) $ ( 458.7 ) Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , we recorded an expense of $ 0.1 and a benefit of $ 0.1 , respectively, and expenses of $ 0.2 and $ 0.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.47 and $ 1.36 per share on May 5, 2023 and May 6, 2022 , respectively. The 2023 dividends were paid on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023 . The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022 . In August 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2021 and 2019 Board authorizations to repurchase 4.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of $ 129.8 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , we repurchased a total of 2.8 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 1.6 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $ 245.0 . As of September 30, 2023 , there were 5.0 million and 0.3 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2023 authorization and 2021 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Interest expense $ 21.0 $ 10.7 $ 59.7 $ 31.7 Interest income ( 8.0 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 24.5 ) ( 10.0 ) Foreign exchange loss 6.0 3.8 14.2 8.9 Miscellaneous income, net ( 3.9 ) ( 5.4 ) ( 15.0 ) ( 16.5 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 15.1 $ 4.7 $ 34.4 $ 14.1 16 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. Our € 500.0 ($ 526.6 ) notes due June 2026 and € 400.0 ($ 419.4 ) notes due June 2027 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of September 30, 2023. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments which matured in September 2022. In September 2022, we entered into a new cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2023 2022 2023 2022 Euro Notes $ 30.6 $ 61.4 $ 11.9 $ 141.2 Cross-currency swaps 6.5 12.2 ( 10.6 ) 23.4 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 17 In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matured in September 2022 and we simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of September 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of € 300.0 and a fixed rate of 1.936 %, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of €400.0 notes to repay our existing € 400.0 notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of $ 2.0 , which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. 18 The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Three Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2023 2022 from AOCI into Income 2023 2022 Cross-currency swaps $ — $ 2.2 Interest and other expenses, net $ — $ 2.1 Foreign currency forward contracts — 0.1 Selling and administrative expenses — ( 0.3 ) Forward starting interest swap — — Interest and other expenses, net 0.1 0.1 Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Nine Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2023 2022 from AOCI into Income 2023 2022 Cross-currency swaps $ — $ 4.5 Interest and other expenses, net $ — $ 4.2 Foreign currency forward contracts — ( 0.2 ) Selling and administrative expenses — ( 0.6 ) Forward starting interest swap — 2.0 Interest and other expenses, net 0.3 0.1 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at September 30, 2023 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns with the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. In September 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in September 2024, which aligns with the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.7975 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Impact of foreign exchange rate changes on the value of the note is offset by gains and losses from the hedges. 19 The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on OCI and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2023 2022 Recognized in Income 2023 2022 Intercompany CHF notes $ — $ — Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 3.3 ) $ ( 8.4 ) Cross-currency swaps ( 0.5 ) 1.7 Interest and other expenses, net 3.3 8.8 Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Nine Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2023 2022 Recognized in Income 2023 2022 Intercompany CHF notes $ — $ — Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 7.4 ) $ ( 16.1 ) Cross-currency swaps ( 2.2 ) 1.4 Interest and other expenses, net 7.4 16.1 Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument Recognized in Income 2023 2022 2023 2022 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 7.3 ) $ ( 14.7 ) $ ( 4.3 ) $ ( 27.9 ) The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Assets September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net 18.6 13.8 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts Receivable, net — 0.2 Total instruments $ 18.6 $ 14.0 20 Liabilities September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 526.6 532.7 Euro Notes due in 2027 Long-term debt 419.4 423.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 35.8 25.8 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 4.8 — Total instruments $ 986.6 $ 982.4 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 909.1 and $ 921.7 as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 946.0 and $ 956.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 133.5 and $ 115.3 as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs).

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery across the company. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 22 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 752.6 $ 886.6 $ 2,259.3 $ 2,679.9 Other Americas 358.7 353.2 1,080.9 1,073.8 1,111.3 1,239.8 3,340.2 3,753.7 Southern Europe: France 1,209.9 1,159.5 3,657.4 3,590.1 Italy 413.7 395.1 1,293.7 1,294.4 Other Southern Europe 485.1 485.2 1,452.4 1,550.6 2,108.7 2,039.8 6,403.5 6,435.1 Northern Europe 914.2 954.1 2,834.3 3,075.7 APME 564.8 586.9 1,770.1 1,808.8 4,699.0 4,820.6 14,348.1 15,073.3 Intercompany Eliminations ( 23.4 ) ( 19.7 ) ( 64.1 ) ( 55.0 ) Consolidated (b) $ 4,675.6 $ 4,800.9 $ 14,284.0 $ 15,018.3 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 25.4 $ 54.7 $ 82.7 $ 177.7 Other Americas 12.5 16.4 47.0 47.1 37.9 71.1 129.7 224.8 Southern Europe: France 47.9 56.6 142.3 168.5 Italy 27.0 29.0 94.0 93.5 Other Southern Europe 9.5 14.7 30.6 45.2 84.4 100.3 266.9 307.2 Northern Europe ( 30.6 ) 12.8 ( 35.3 ) 26.9 APME 24.2 23.4 71.0 64.9 115.9 207.6 432.3 623.8 Corporate expenses ( 37.4 ) ( 37.0 ) ( 110.8 ) ( 114.8 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 8.7 ) ( 9.1 ) ( 26.2 ) ( 28.1 ) Operating profit 69.8 161.5 295.3 480.9 Interest and other expenses, net ( 15.1 ) ( 4.7 ) ( 34.4 ) ( 14.1 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 54.7 $ 156.8 $ 260.9 $ 466.8 23 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 37 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a ""forward-looking statement""). Statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” and other similar expressions. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A – Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2022, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions, particularly in Europe, including inflation, impacts of the Russia-Ukraine War and its related supply-chain impact; other geopolitical risk and uncertainty; changes in labor and tax legislation in places we do business; failure to implement strategic technology investments; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise. We caution that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the third quarter of 2023, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. By contrast, during periods of increased demand we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. In the third quarter of 2023, we continued to observe softening demand for staffing services due to increased economic uncertainty, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that downside risks to the global economic outlook have continued to increase through the third quarter of 2023 and may worsen in future periods. These economic risks are particularly high in Europe, driven by elevated inflation and higher interest rates. As Europe represents a significant portion of our operations, we continue to monitor economic conditions in our Southern Europe and Northern Europe segments. The Americas market is also experiencing a challenging operating environment, driven primarily by elevated inflation and the United States' sensitivity to rising interest rates, which could impact other countries given the importance of the United States economy. As a result of these factors, we expect the business environment will continue to be challenging for us, especially in North America and Europe, with many companies delaying hiring decisions or reducing their demand for contingent labor. Compounding the challenging business environment, the attack in Israel on October 7, 2023 and the subsequent hostilities in Gaza will negatively impact our operations in Israel, which represent approximately 4.1% of our revenues in the Southern Europe region and 1.8% of our ManpowerGroup revenues. These evolving events are expected to put further pressure on our results for the segment and may increase geopolitical risk and business caution more globally. During the third quarter of 2023, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in many of our key markets, which therefore had a 2.8% favorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.01 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency 24 exchange rates primarily impact the translation of reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, we experienced a -10.4% revenue decrease in the Americas, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, decreased demand for our Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) permanent recruitment services, a decrease in our TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) business as we exited lower margin arrangements and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. During the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, we experienced a 3.4% revenue increase in Southern Europe, primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. During the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, we experienced a -4.2% revenue decrease in Northern Europe, primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services. We experienced a -3.8% revenue decrease in APME in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Experis interim services and our RPO permanent recruitment services. From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue decreases in Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. In our Manpower brand, the revenue decrease was primarily due to decreased demand for staffing services, especially within the manufacturing sector, and decreased demand for our permanent recruitment services. The revenue decrease in our Experis brand was primarily due to decreased demand for interim services from both enterprise and convenience customer segments, and decreased demand for our permanent recruitment services. On an overall basis, the revenue decrease in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes RPO, MSP and our Right Management offerings, was primarily due to decreased demand for our RPO offerings relative to the prior year period, as the permanent recruitment environment was exceptionally strong during the third quarter of 2022. The decrease was also due to our MSP business, which experienced revenue declines during the quarter, as we exited lower margin arrangements in the current year period and compared to significant activity levels in the prior year period. This revenue decrease in Talent Solutions was partially offset by an increase in demand for our outplacement services under Right Management. Our gross profit margin decreased in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to an unfavorable change in business mix, particularly due to declines in our higher-margin permanent recruitment businesses. The decrease in gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 was partially offset by growth in our higher-margin outplacement offerings within Right Management. Our operating profit decreased -56.8% in the third quarter of 2023 while our operating profit margin decreased 190 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. Excluding restructuring costs of $38.1 million incurred in the third quarter of 2023 and acquisition integration costs of $5.6 million incurred in the third quarter of 2022, our operating profit decreased -35.5% while operating profit margin decreased 120 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. The operating profit margin decreased primarily because we did not reduce selling and administrative expenses for the quarter at the same rate as the decline in revenues and gross profit. During the quarter we initiated significant restructuring actions on businesses heavily impacted by the continuing decline in activity. With these actions, we expect our overall cost structure to go down and will continue to monitor expenses closely to maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 25 Operating Results - Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 2022. (in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 4,675.6 $ 4,800.9 (2.6 )% (5.4 )% Cost of services 3,853.7 3,922.4 (1.8 )% (4.6 )% Gross profit 821.9 878.5 (6.4 )% (9.0 )% Gross profit margin 17.6 % 18.3 % Selling and administrative expenses 752.1 717.0 4.9 % 2.0 % Operating profit 69.8 161.5 (56.8 )% (57.9 )% Operating profit margin 1.5 % 3.4 % Interest and other expenses, net 15.1 4.7 215.6 % Earnings before income taxes 54.7 156.8 (65.1 )% (65.8 )% Provision for income taxes 24.4 45.5 (46.2 )% Effective income tax rate 44.7 % 29.0 % Net earnings $ 30.3 $ 111.3 (72.8 )% (73.3 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 0.60 $ 2.13 (71.7 )% (72.2 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 50.1 52.3 (4.1 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -2.6% (-5.4% in constant currency) was attributed to: 26 The year-over-year 70 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 4.9% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2023 (2.0% in constant currency and 2.1% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 120 basis points in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to: 27 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including those associated with noncontrolling interests. Interest expense, net was $13.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to the higher interest cost on pension obligations and increased revolver borrowings at a higher interest rate during the period. Foreign exchange loss, net was $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to non-cash currency translation loss related to our Argentina business. Argentina is required to be treated as a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes and the non-cash currency translation losses reflected the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. This is a non-cash accounting charge as our Argentina business operates in their local currency. Miscellaneous income, net was $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to a translation loss on the sale of our Philippines business. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 44.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 29.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was unfavorably impacted by a lower level of pre-tax earnings with a less beneficial mix due in part to restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75% to 0.375% effective January 1, 2023 and the effective settlement of an income tax audit. In certain countries in which we recorded restructuring costs, we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to the recognition of valuation allowances against anticipated tax losses. The 44.7% effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, the French business tax, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $0.60 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $2.13 in the third quarter of 2022. Restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.68, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2023. Non-cash currency translation loss related to our Argentina business in the third quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.07, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2023. Other Expense losses related to the deconsolidation of our Philippines business unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.03, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2023. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 50.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 from 52.3 million in the third quarter of 2022. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by grants of share-based awards. Operating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 2022.

Interest expense, net was $35.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $21.7 million in the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to the higher interest cost on pension obligations and increased revolver borrowings at a higher interest rate during the period. Miscellaneous income, net was $15.0 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $16.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to a translation loss on the sale of our Philippines business. Foreign exchange loss, net was $14.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $8.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to non-cash currency translation loss related to our Argentina business. Argentina is required to be treated as a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes and the non-cash currency translation losses reflected the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the first nine months of 2023. This is a non-cash accounting charge as our Argentina business operates in their local currency. 30 We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 30.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was unfavorably impacted by a lower level of pre-tax earnings with a less beneficial mix due in part to restructuring costs recorded in the second and third quarters of 2023 and favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75% to 0.375% effective January 1, 2023 and the effective settlement of an income tax audit. The 33.6% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, the French business tax, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $3.42 in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $6.10 in the first nine months of 2022. Restructuring costs recorded in the first nine months of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.00, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.15 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Non-cash currency translation losses related to our Argentina business in the first nine months of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.13, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2023. Other expense losses related to the deconsolidation of our Philippines business unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.03, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2023. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 50.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 from 53.3 million in the first nine months of 2022. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first nine months of 2022, partially offset by grants of share-based awards. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased -10.4% (-7.0% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. In the United States (which represents 68% of the Americas' revenues), revenues from services decreased -15.1% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in demand for our Experis and Manpower staffing/interim services, decreased demand for our RPO permanent recruitment services and a decrease in our MSP business as we exited lower margin arrangements, partially offset by an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 1.6% (13.3% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Experis Interim services. The constant currency increase in Other Americas was primarily due to inflation in Argentina. The increase in Other Americas was driven by revenue increases in Mexico and Argentina of 20.7% and 9.7%, respectively (1.8% and 150.6%, respectively, in constant currency), partially offset by a decrease in revenues in Canada of -16.6% (-14.3% in constant currency). In the Americas, revenues from services decreased -11.0% (-7.5% in constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. In the United States, revenues from services decreased -15.7% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, decreased demand for our RPO permanent recruitment services and a decrease in our MSP business as we exited lower margin arrangements, partially offset by an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 0.7% (13.0% in constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily due increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Experis interim services. The constant currency increase in Other Americas was primarily due to inflation in Argentina. The increase in Other Americas was driven by revenue increases in Mexico and Argentina of 13.8% and 19.2%, respectively (decrease of -0.2% and increase of 140.2%, respectively, in constant currency), partially offset by a revenue decrease in Canada of -14.3% (-10.1% in constant currency). 31 Gross profit margin decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 primarily due to decreases in our higher-margin permanent recruitment business, partially offset by a higher percentage of the revenue mix coming from our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business and increased margins in our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -5.2% (-3.9% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in salaries from a reduction in headcount, a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets and zero acquisition integration costs in the third quarter of 2023 compared to acquisition transaction costs of $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2022. The decreases were partially offset by $6.0 million in restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2022. The restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -4.6% (-3.1% in constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets, a decrease in salaries from a reduction in headcount and zero acquisition integration costs in the first nine months of 2023 compared to acquisition integration costs of $12.0 million in the first nine months of 2022. The decreases were partially offset by $7.6 million in restructuring costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to zero in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The restructuring charges in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas decreased to 3.4% in the third quarter of 2023 from 5.7% in the third quarter of 2022. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 3.4% in the third quarter of 2023 from 6.2% in the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to a decrease in our gross profit margin as we saw decreases in our higher-margin permanent recruitment and Manpower staffing services and an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.5% in the third quarter of 2023 from 4.6% in the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, partially offset by an increase in our gross profit margin as we saw increases in our higher-margin Experis interim services. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas decreased to 3.9% in the first nine months of 2023 from 6.0% in the first nine months of 2022. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 3.7% in the first nine months of 2023 from 6.6% in the first nine months of 2022 primarily due an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue and a decrease in our gross profit margin as we saw decreases in our higher-margin permanent recruitment and Manpower staffing services. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 4.3% in the first nine months of 2023 from 4.4% in the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, partially offset by an increase in our gross profit margin as we saw increases in our higher-margin Experis interim services. 32 Southern Europe In Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 3.4% (decrease of -3.4% in constant currency and -3.3% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. In France (which represents 57% of Southern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 4.4% (decrease of -3.4% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. In Italy (which represents 20% of Southern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 4.7% (decrease of -3.1% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase in France is primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. The increase in France was partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as clients reduced demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily construction and logistics. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and increased demand for our Experis consulting services, partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services remained flat (decrease of -3.7% in constant currency) during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. The results in Other Southern Europe were driven by a revenue increase in Spain of 2.2% (decrease of -5.5% in constant currency), partially offset by a revenue decrease in Switzerland of -0.4% (-8.9% in constant currency). In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -0.5% (-1.9% in constant currency and -2.1% in organic constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. In France, revenues from services increased 1.9% (0.0% in constant currency and -0.6% in organic constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. In Italy, revenues from services decreased -0.1% (-1.8% in constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. The increase in France is primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services, partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services due to the impact of significant revenue growth in the prior year period. The decrease in Italy was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, a 7.6% increase (6.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and increased demand for our Experis consulting services. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -6.3% (-6.4% in constant currency) during the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services. The decrease in Other Southern Europe was driven by revenue decreases in Spain and Switzerland of -11.5% and -2.8%, respectively (-13.1% and -7.9%, respectively, in constant currency). Gross profit margin was stable in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. The stability was primarily due to an increase in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement services which balanced out the unfavorable impact of a decrease in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services. Gross profit margin increased in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a higher percentage of the revenue mix coming from our higher-margin Talent Solutions Outplacement services and increased margins in our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 12.7% (5.4% in constant currency and 5.7% in organic constant currency) during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs, $3.8 million in restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2022 and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. The restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions in the regional head office and in France. 33 Selling and administrative expenses increased 8.7% (7.3% in constant currency and 6.2% in organic constant currency) during the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs, $10.2 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first nine months of 2023 compared to zero in the first nine months of 2022 and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets. The restructuring charges in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions in Spain of $6.2 million, as well as in the regional head office and in France. OUP margin in Southern Europe decreased to 4.0% in the third quarter of 2023 from 4.9% in the third quarter of 2022. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 4.0% for the third quarter of 2023 compared to 4.9% for the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in France was due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 6.5% for the third quarter of 2023 from 7.3% for the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. In Other Southern Europe, the OUP margin decreased to 2.0% for the third quarter of 2023 from 3.0% for the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue and a decrease to our gross profit margin. OUP margin in Southern Europe decreased to 4.2% in the first nine months of 2023 from 4.8% in the first nine months of 2022. In France, the OUP margin was 3.9% for the first nine months of 2023 compared to 4.7% for the first nine months of 2022. The decrease in France was primarily due to decreased operating leverage as we saw an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.3% for the first nine months of 2023 from 7.2% for the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to an increase in the gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. In Other Southern Europe, the OUP margin decreased to 2.1% for the first nine months of 2023 from 2.9% for the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, the largest country operations include the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 35%, 20%, 15%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues). In the Northern Europe region, revenues from services decreased -4.2% (-9.5% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom and the Nordics of -10.3% and -16.9%, respectively (-16.6% and -14.6%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium of 11.1%, 0.6% and 12.3%, respectively (2.8%, -6.9% and 4.0%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and the -15.7% decrease (-21.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In the Northern Europe region, revenues from services decreased -7.8% (-6.5% in constant currency and -6.3% in organic constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, and the Netherlands of -14.0%, -14.0% and -4.9%, respectively (-12.8%, -6.6% and -6.4%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in Germany and Belgium of 4.5% and 4.5%, respectively (2.7% and 2.3%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, a -11.2% decrease (-9.8% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services and increased demand within our MSP business. 34 Gross profit margin decreased in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to business mix changes and a reduction in permanent recruitment activity. Gross profit margin increased in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to increases in our staffing/interim margins and the increased demand for our higher-margin outplacement services. Selling and administrative expenses increased 20.7% (14.1% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily due to $27.5 million in restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2022 and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets. The restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions and professional and other fees in Germany of $14.6 million and headcount reductions in the Nordics of $6.9 million, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium. Selling and administrative expenses increased 5.7% (6.5% in constant currency and 6.6% in organic constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. The increase is primarily due to $37.7 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first nine months of 2023 compared to zero in the first nine months of 2022 and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by the disposition of our Russia business of $9.7 million incurred in the first nine months of 2022. The restructuring charges in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions and professional and other fees in Germany of $19.1 million and headcount reductions in the Nordics of $12.1 million, as well as the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Belgium. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to -3.4% in the third quarter of 2023 from 1.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and decreased to -1.2% in the first nine months of 2023 from 0.9% in the first nine months of 2022. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to an increase in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue as we incurred significant restructuring costs compared to the prior year period. APME Revenues from services decreased -3.8% (-1.6% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. In Japan (which represents 49% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 5.8% (10.5% in constant currency) due to increased demand in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In Australia (which represents 8% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -36.8% (-34.1% in constant currency), primarily due to decreased demand for our RPO permanent recruitment services, decreased demand for our Experis interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. Revenues from services decreased -2.1% (increase of 3.4% in constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. In Japan, revenues from services increased 3.4% (11.7% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In Australia, revenues from services decreased -18.6% (-13.9% in constant currency), primarily due to decreased demand for our Experis interim services, decreased demand for our RPO permanent recruitment services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. 35 Gross profit margin decreased in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to business mix changes and a reduction in permanent recruitment activity. Gross profit margin increased in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022 primarily due to an increased business mix of our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement services and increases in the margin for our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -14.2% (-12.1% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salary related costs from a reduction in headcount, a decrease in office lease related costs and a reduction in costs related to consulting and outside services, partially offset by $0.8 million in restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2022. The restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions in Australia. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -4.4% (increase of 1.0% in constant currency) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salary related costs from a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office lease related costs, partially offset by $3.3 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first nine months of 2023 compared to zero in the first nine months of 2022. The restructuring charges in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily related to headcount reductions in Australia. OUP margin for APME increased to 4.3% in the third quarter of 2023 from 4.0% in the third quarter of 2022 due to a decrease in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, partially offset by decreased gross profit margins as we saw a reduction in our higher-margin permanent recruitment activity. OUP margin for APME increased to 4.0% in the first nine months of 2023 from 3.6% in the first nine months of 2022 due to a decrease in our selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue and an increase to the gross profit margin as we saw increases in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement services. 36 Financ ial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance, including Argentina which operates in a hyperinflationary economy. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of September 30, 2023, we had $500.3 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. Cash generated in operating activities was $234.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $289.2 million generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $42.1 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $141.6 million utilized during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,600.2 million as of September 30, 2023 from $5,137.4 million as of December 31, 2022 primarily due to the revenue decline and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") approximated 59 days as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 3 days from December 31, 2022. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll-related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable are outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. 38 Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. While this may result in an increase in our operating cash flows, longer payment terms and timing of payroll, tax and supplier related payments significantly impact our cash position and cash flows each period. Any increase in operating cash flows from an economic slowdown would not be sustained in the event that a downturn continues for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $55.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $18.1 million, which primarily represents a consideration payment for the acquisition of Tingari, a talent solutions company in France, and contingent consideration payments associated with previous acquisitions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On September 29, 2023, we disposed of our Philippines business in our APME segment for total consideration of $6.5 million. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $1.3 million. Net debt repayments were $13.7 million and $67.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The higher balance in 2022 resulted from the $75.0 million repayment we made into our revolving credit facility to clear the outstanding borrowings related to our 2021 Experis acquisition. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and June 2027, respectively. When those notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets for replacement of those notes. Our $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.41 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.26 to 1 as of September 30, 2023. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2023, we had letters of credit of $0.4 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.6 million were available to us under the facility as of September 30, 2023. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of September 30, 2023, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $299.7 million, of which $283.7 million was unused. Under the revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. We have assessed our liquidity position as of September 30, 2023 and for the near future. As of September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $571.1 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, less any outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $283.7 million was available to use as of September 30, 2023. Our €500.0 ($526.6) million notes mature in June 2026, and our €400.0 ($419.4) million notes mature in June 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. 39 The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.47 and $1.36 per share on May 5, 2023 and May 6, 2022, respectively. The 2023 dividends were payable on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022. In August 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. The authorization was in addition to the August 2021 and 2019 Board authorizations to repurchase 4.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of $129.8 million. During the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased a total of 2.8 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 1.6 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $245.0 million. As of September 30, 2023, there were 5.0 million and 0.3 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2023 authorization and 2021 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,010.5 million as of September 30, 2023 related to debt, operating leases, severance and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,020.3 million as of December 31, 2022. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $805.5 million and $840.2 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively ($756.7 million and $793.0 million for guarantees, respectively, and $48.8 million and $47.2 million for stand-by letters of credit as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.3 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded $47.1 million in severance restructuring costs and $12.1 million in other restructuring costs, primarily consisting of professional and other fees associated with restructuring activities. We did not record any restructuring costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made payments of $31.7 million out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance, office closures and consolidations, and professional and other fees related to restructuring in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $40.7 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2024. Application of Critical Accounting Policies In accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below carrying value. Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be a component of the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2023 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. 40 We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2023 and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests. Refer to Note 1 for results of our annual goodwill impairment testing.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Balance, December 31, 2022 109.3 Provisions charged to earnings 2.9 Write-offs ( 7.2 ) Translation adjustments 2.1 Balance, June 30, 2023 $ 107.1 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. 8 We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we identified several factors related to our Netherlands reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount which triggered us to perform an interim impairment assessment. As a result, we wrote the carrying value of the Netherlands reporting unit down to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $ 50.0 . Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 were a discount rate of 13.5 %, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 0.0 % to 3.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 % and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0 %. Management continues to closely monitor the results of the reporting unit and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. The performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the Netherlands reporting unit. If management determines that the Netherlands reporting unit cannot achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, or if there is continued deterioration in the market due to macroeconomic conditions, some or all of the remaining recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which w as $ 56.2 as of June 30, 2023, could be subject to further impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by 20 % or more, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2023 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024 . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to June 30, 2023, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 33.7 as of June 30, 2023 and $ 35.6 as of December 31, 2022. 9 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types.

The exp ense relates to stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and performance share units. Lower expense in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 resulted primarily from lower estimated payouts related to performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 1.7 and $ 0.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the six months ended June 30, 2023 . For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 1.4 , which represents a contingent consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. 11 (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded $ 21.1 in restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2023. We did not record any restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2022. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we made payments of $ 12.8 out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 21.5 reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below: Americas (a) Southern Europe (b) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 11.0 $ 0.2 $ — $ 13.2 Severance costs 1.6 6.4 5.7 2.5 0.4 16.6 Other costs — — 4.5 — — 4.5 Costs paid ( 1.6 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 10.3 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 12.8 ) Balance, June 30, 2023 $ 1.0 $ 7.0 $ 10.9 $ 2.6 $ — $ 21.5 (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 31.9 % for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 29.8 % for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75 % to 0.375 % effective January 1, 2023 and unfavorably impacted by a lower level of pre-tax earnings with a less beneficial mix due in part to restructuring costs recorded in the second quarter of 2023. In certain countries in which we recorded restructuring costs, we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to the recognition of valuation allowances against anticipated tax losses. The 31.9 % effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 30.6 % for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 31.0 % for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75 % to 0.375 % effective January 1, 2023. The 30.6 % effective tax rate for the first half of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of June 30, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 75.0 . If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 81.6 . We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2016 through 2023 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of June 30, 2023, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Spain, Philippines and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 12 (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 65.2 $ 122.2 $ 143.0 $ 213.8 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 50.2 52.7 50.4 53.2 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.1 — — Effect of other share-based awards 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 50.7 53.4 51.0 53.8 Net earnings per share - basic $ 1.30 $ 2.32 $ 2.84 $ 4.02 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 1.29 $ 2.29 $ 2.80 $ 3.97 There were 0.7 million and 0.5 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive.

During 2023, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 21.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. 14 (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Foreign currency translation $ ( 311.7 ) $ ( 369.7 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans, net of income taxes of $ 19.1 on both dates ( 132.9 ) ( 132.8 ) Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 13.3 ) and $( 5.3 ), respectively ( 3.1 ) 53.4 Gain on interest rate swap, net of income taxes of $ 0.4 on both dates 1.2 1.4 Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 20.3 ) and $( 20.4 ), respectively ( 13.8 ) ( 12.2 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.8 and $ 1.9 , respectively 0.8 1.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 459.5 ) $ ( 458.7 ) Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded expenses of $ 0.1 and $ 0.2 , respectively, and $ 0.1 and $ 0.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.47 and $ 1.36 per share on May 5, 2023 and May 6, 2022 , respectively. The 2023 dividends were paid on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023 . The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022 . In August 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2021 and 2019 Board authorizations to repurchase 4.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of $ 81.9 , including 25,000 shares at a cost of $ 2.0 that were repurchased but not yet settled. During the first six months of 2022, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 0.5 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $ 160.0 . As of June 30, 2023, there were 0.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Interest expense $ 20.0 $ 10.6 $ 38.7 $ 21.0 Interest income ( 8.4 ) ( 2.8 ) ( 16.5 ) ( 5.6 ) Foreign exchange loss 5.1 3.3 8.2 5.1 Miscellaneous income, net ( 4.9 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 11.1 ) ( 11.1 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 11.8 $ 6.7 $ 19.3 $ 9.4 15 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. Our € 500.0 ($ 543.4 ) notes due June 2026 and € 400.0 ($ 432.7 ) notes due June 2027 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of June 30, 2023. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments which matured in September 2022. In September 2022, we entered into a new cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2023 2022 2023 2022 Euro Notes $ ( 6.4 ) $ 52.5 $ ( 18.7 ) $ 79.8 Cross-currency swaps ( 16.7 ) 8.3 ( 17.1 ) 11.2 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 16 In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matured in September 2022 and we simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of September 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of € 300.0 and a fixed rate of 1.936 %, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of €400.0 notes to repay our existing € 400.0 notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of $ 2.0 , which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. 17 The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Three Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2023 2022 from AOCI into Income 2023 2022 Cross-currency swaps $ — $ 3.3 Interest and other expenses, net $ — $ 3.0 Foreign currency forward contracts — ( 0.2 ) Selling and administrative expenses — ( 0.3 ) Forward starting interest swap — 2.0 Interest and other expenses, net 0.1 — Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Six Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2023 2022 from AOCI into Income 2023 2022 Cross-currency swaps $ — $ 2.3 Interest and other expenses, net $ — $ 2.1 Foreign currency forward contracts — ( 0.3 ) Selling and administrative expenses — ( 0.3 ) Forward starting interest swap — 2.0 Interest and other expenses, net 0.2 — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2023 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns with the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. In September 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in September 2024, which aligns with the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.7975 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Impact of foreign exchange rate changes on the value of the note is offset by gains and losses from the hedges. 18 The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on OCI and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2023 2022 Recognized in Income 2023 2022 Intercompany CHF notes $ — $ — Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 4.8 ) $ ( 5.1 ) Cross-currency swaps — ( 0.3 ) Interest and other expenses, net 4.8 4.7 Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Six Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2023 2022 Recognized in Income 2023 2022 Intercompany CHF notes $ — $ — Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 4.1 ) $ ( 7.7 ) Cross-currency swaps ( 1.7 ) ( 0.3 ) Interest and other expenses, net 4.1 7.3 Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument Recognized in Income 2023 2022 2023 2022 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ 3.6 $ ( 8.4 ) $ 3.0 $ ( 13.2 ) The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Assets June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net 16.5 13.8 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts Receivable, net 2.8 0.2 Total instruments $ 19.3 $ 14.0 Liabilities June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 543.4 532.7 Euro Notes due in 2027 Long-term debt 432.7 423.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 42.6 25.8 Total instruments $ 1,018.7 $ 982.4 19 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 938.2 and $ 921.7 as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 976.1 and $ 956.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 137.1 and $ 115.3 as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating lease expense $ 36.6 $ 31.1 $ 71.3 $ 64.0 Short-term lease expense 1.5 1.4 2.6 2.6 Other lease expense (a) 3.7 4.3 7.8 9.0 Total lease expense $ 41.8 $ 36.8 $ 81.7 $ 75.6 Other information related to leases was as follows: Six Months Ended June 30, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2023 2022 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 67.9 $ 63.7 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 73.1 13.5 June 30, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2023 2022 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 404.7 $ 365.7 Operating lease liabilities - current (a) $ 103.6 $ 105.5 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 308.7 266.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 412.3 $ 372.1 June 30, 2023 2022 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 5.6 years 4.9 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 3.4 % 2.3 % 20 Maturities of operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2023 were as follows: Period Ending June 30, 2023 Operating Leases 2023 $ 60.8 2024 101.1 2025 75.5 2026 57.7 2027 48.0 2028 38.5 Thereafter 81.8 Total future undiscounted lease payments 463.4 Less imputed interest ( 51.1 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 412.3 (15) Segment Data We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery across the company. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 21 Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 736.7 $ 903.9 $ 1,506.7 $ 1,793.3 Other Americas 362.0 358.8 722.2 720.6 1,098.7 1,262.7 2,228.9 2,513.9 Southern Europe: France 1,278.2 1,238.2 2,447.5 2,430.6 Italy 457.8 454.3 880.0 899.3 Other Southern Europe 490.9 508.9 967.3 1,065.4 2,226.9 2,201.4 4,294.8 4,395.3 Northern Europe 952.5 1,027.1 1,920.1 2,121.6 APME 599.4 603.7 1,205.3 1,221.9 4,877.5 5,094.9 9,649.1 10,252.7 Intercompany Eliminations ( 21.4 ) ( 20.8 ) ( 40.7 ) ( 35.3 ) Consolidated (b) $ 4,856.1 $ 5,074.1 $ 9,608.4 $ 10,217.4 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 26.2 $ 64.7 $ 57.3 $ 123.0 Other Americas 17.0 16.2 34.5 30.7 43.2 80.9 91.8 153.7 Southern Europe: France 49.5 62.3 94.4 111.9 Italy 36.3 35.5 67.0 64.5 Other Southern Europe 6.8 13.9 21.1 30.5 92.6 111.7 182.5 206.9 Northern Europe ( 9.7 ) 10.8 ( 4.7 ) 14.1 APME 25.7 22.5 46.8 41.5 151.8 225.9 316.4 416.2 Corporate expenses ( 35.5 ) ( 35.8 ) ( 73.4 ) ( 77.8 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 8.7 ) ( 9.4 ) ( 17.5 ) ( 19.0 ) Operating profit 107.6 180.7 225.5 319.4 Interest and other expenses, net ( 11.8 ) ( 6.7 ) ( 19.3 ) ( 9.4 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 95.8 $ 174.0 $ 206.2 $ 310.0 22 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 35 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a ""forward-looking statement""). Statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” and other similar expressions. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A – Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2022, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions, particularly in Europe, including inflation, impacts of the Russia-Ukraine War and its related supply-chain impact; other geopolitical risk and uncertainty; changes in labor and tax legislation in places we do business; failure to implement strategic technology investments; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise. We caution that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the second quarter of 2023, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. By contrast, during periods of increased demand we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. As we concluded the second quarter of 2023, we observed softening demand for staffing services due to increased economic uncertainty, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that downside risks to the global economic outlook have continued to increase through the second quarter of 2023, and may worsen in future periods. These economic risks are particularly high in Europe, driven by elevated inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and its related supply chain impacts, and higher interest rates. As Europe represents a significant portion of our operations, we continue to monitor economic conditions in our Southern Europe and Northern Europe segments. The Americas market is also experiencing a challenging operating environment, driven primarily by elevated inflation, sensitivity to supply chain impacts, and the United States' sensitivity to rising interest rates, which could impact other countries given the importance of the United States economy. As a result of these factors, we expect the business environment will continue to be challenging for us, especially in the United States and Europe, with many companies delaying hiring decisions or reducing their demand for contingent labor. During the second quarter of 2023, the strength of the dollar, particularly against the Euro, had a 0.8% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.04 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact the translation of reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. 23 During the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, we experienced a -13.0% revenue decrease in the Americas, primarily driven by the decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. During the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, we experienced a 1.2% revenue increase in Southern Europe, primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. During the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, we experienced a -7.3% revenue decrease in Northern Europe, primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. We experienced a -0.7% revenue decrease in APME in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Experis interim services. From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue decreases in Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. In our Manpower brand, the revenue decrease was primarily due to decreased demand for staffing services, especially within the manufacturing sector, and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. The revenue decrease in our Experis brand was primarily due to decreased demand for interim services from both enterprise and convenience customer segments, and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. On an overall basis, the revenue decrease in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was primarily due to decreased demand for our RPO offerings relative to the prior year period, as the permanent recruitment environment was exceptionally strong during the second quarter of 2022. The decrease was also due to our MSP business which experienced revenue declines during the quarter, as we exited lower margin arrangements and experienced significant activity levels in the prior year period. This revenue decrease in Talent Solutions was partially offset by an increase in demand for our outplacement services under Right Management. Our gross profit margin decreased in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to an unfavorable change in business mix, particularly due to declines in our permanent recruitment businesses. The decrease in gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 was partially offset by growth in our higher-margin outplacement offerings within Right Management. Our operating profit decreased -40.4% in the second quarter of 2023 while our operating profit margin decreased 140 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022. Excluding restructuring costs of $14.5 million incurred in the second quarter of 2023 and acquisition integration costs of $2.7 million incurred in the second quarter of 2022, our operating profit decreased -33.4% while operating profit margin decreased 110 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022. The operating profit margin decreased primarily because we did not reduce selling and administrative expenses for the quarter at the same rate as the decline in revenues and gross profit. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 24 Operating Results - Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to 2022. (in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 4,856.1 $ 5,074.1 (4.3 )% (3.5 )% Cost of services 3,993.8 4,152.9 (3.8 )% (3.0 )% Gross profit 862.3 921.2 (6.4 )% (5.7 )% Gross profit margin 17.8 % 18.2 % Selling and administrative expenses 754.7 740.5 1.9 % 2.5 % Operating profit 107.6 180.7 (40.4 )% (39.1 )% Operating profit margin 2.2 % 3.6 % Interest and other expenses, net 11.8 6.7 76.7 % Earnings before income taxes 95.8 174.0 (45.0 )% (43.4 )% Provision for income taxes 30.6 51.8 (41.0 )% Effective income tax rate 31.9 % 29.8 % Net earnings $ 65.2 $ 122.2 (46.6 )% (45.2 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 1.29 $ 2.29 (43.8 )% (42.2 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 50.7 53.4 (5.1 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -4.3% (-3.5% in constant currency and -3.7% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 25 The year-over-year 40 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 1.9% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2023 (increase of 2.5% in constant currency and 1.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 90 basis points in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 due primarily to: 26 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including those associated with noncontrolling interests. Interest expense, net was $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $7.8 million in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the higher interest rate environment. Foreign exchange loss, net was $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to non-cash currency translation loss related to our Argentina business. Argentina is required to be treated as a hyperinflationary economy and the non-cash currency translation losses reflected the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. This is a non-cash accounting charge as our Argentina business operates in their local currency. Miscellaneous expense, net was $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 31.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 29.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75% to 0.375% effective January 1, 2023 and unfavorably impacted by a lower level of pre-tax earnings with a less beneficial mix due in part to restructuring costs recorded in the quarter. In certain countries in which we recorded restructuring costs, we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to the recognition of valuation allowances against anticipated tax losses. The 31.9% effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $1.29 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $2.29 in the second quarter of 2022. Restructuring costs recorded in the second quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.23, net of tax, in the second quarter of 2023. Non-cash currency translation loss related to our Argentina business in the second quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06, net of tax, in the second quarter of 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 50.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 from 53.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by grants of share-based awards. Operating Results - Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to 2022.

Interest expense, net was $22.2 million in the first half of 2023 compared to $15.4 million in the first half of 2022 primarily due to the higher interest rate environment. Miscellaneous expense, net was $11.1 million in both the first half of 2023 and the first half of 2022. Foreign exchange loss, net was $8.2 million in the first half of 2023 compared to $5.1 million in the first half of 2022 primarily due to non-cash currency translation loss related to our Argentina business. Argentina is required to be treated as a hyperinflationary economy and the non-cash currency translation losses reflected the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the first half of 2023. This is a non-cash accounting charge as our Argentina business operates in their local currency. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 30.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 31.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The 2023 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75% to 0.375% effective January 1, 2023. The 30.6% effective tax rate for the first half of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. 29 Net earnings per share - diluted was $2.80 in the first half of 2023 compared to $3.97 in the first half of 2022. Restructuring costs recorded in the first half of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.28, net of tax, in the first half of 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.17 per share in the first half of 2023. Non-cash currency translation losses related to our Argentina business in the first half of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06, net of tax, in the first half of 2023. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 51.0 million in the first half of 2023 from 53.8 million in the first half of 2022. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first half of 2022, partially offset by grants of share-based awards. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased -13.0% (-9.3% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. In the United States (which represents 67% of the Americas' revenues), revenues from services decreased -18.5% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in demand for our Experis and Manpower staffing/interim services, a decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment business of -44.8% and a decrease in our MSP business as we exited lower margin arrangements, partially offset by an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 0.9% (14.0% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. The constant currency increase in Other Americas was primarily due to inflation in Argentina. The increase in Other Americas was driven by revenue increases in Mexico and Argentina of 13.3% and 20.9%, respectively (-0.1% and 138.0%, respectively, in constant currency), partially offset by a decrease in revenues in Canada of -14.3% (-9.9% in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. In the Americas, revenues from services decreased -11.3% (-7.7% in constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. In the United States, revenues from services decreased -16.0% in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of -37.7% and a decrease in our MSP business as we exited lower margin arrangements, partially offset by an increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 0.2% (12.9% in constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 primarily due increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency increase in Other Americas was primarily due to inflation in Argentina. The increase in Other Americas was driven by revenue increases in Mexico and Argentina of 10.4% and 24.2%, respectively (-1.1% and 134.7%, respectively, in constant currency), partially offset by a revenue decrease in Canada of -13.2% (-8.0% in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. Gross profit margin decreased in the second quarter and first half of 2023 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2022 primarily due to decreases in our high-margin permanent recruitment business, partially offset by a higher percentage of the revenue mix coming from our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business and increased margins in our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -6.9% (-5.4% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets and zero acquisition integration costs in the second quarter of 2023 compared to acquisition transaction costs of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2022. The decreases were partially offset by $0.8 million of restructuring costs incurred in the second quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the second quarter of 2022. 30 Selling and administrative expenses decreased -4.3% (-2.7% in constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets and zero acquisition integration costs in the first half of 2023 compared to acquisition integration costs of $6.4 million in the first half of 2022. The decreases were partially offset by $1.6 million of restructuring costs incurred in the first half of 2023 compared to zero in the first half of 2022, and an increase in salary-related costs. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas decreased to 3.9% in the second quarter of 2023 from 6.4% in the second quarter of 2022. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 3.6% in the second quarter of 2023 from 7.2% in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to decreases in our higher-margin permanent recruitment and Experis interim services, decreased operating leverage and a slight decrease in the gross profit margin due to an unfavorable business mix, partially offset by an increase in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.7% in the second quarter of 2023 from 4.5% in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to gross profit margin improvement. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas decreased to 4.1% in the first half of 2023 from 6.1% in the first half of 2022. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 3.8% in the first half of 2023 from 6.9% in the first half of 2022 primarily due to decreases in our higher-margin permanent recruitment business and Experis interim services, decreased operating leverage and a slight decrease in the gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.8% in the first half of 2023 from 4.3% in the first half of 2022 primarily due to gross profit margin improvement. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 1.2% (-0.9% in constant currency and -1.3% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. In France (which represents 57% of Southern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 3.2% (0.9% in constant currency and -0.1% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. In Italy (which represents 21% of Southern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 0.8% (-1.5% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase in France is primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and the increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. The increase in France was partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and increased demand for our Experis consulting services, partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -3.5% (-4.7% in constant currency) during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. The decrease in Other Southern Europe was driven by a revenue decrease in Spain of -6.6% (-8.7% in constant currency), partially offset by a revenue increase in Switzerland of 1.7% (decrease of -5.4% in constant currency). In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -2.3% (-1.2% in constant currency and -1.6% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. In France, revenues from services increased 0.7% (1.7% in constant currency and -0.7% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. In Italy, revenues from services decreased -2.1% (-1.2% in constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. The increase in France is primarily due to the increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services due to the impact of significant revenue growth in the prior year period, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in Italy was partially offset by a 7.8% increase (9.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and increased demand for our Experis consulting services. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -9.2% (-7.6% in constant currency) during the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. The decrease in Other Southern Europe was driven by revenue decreases in Spain and Switzerland of -17.3% and -4.1%, respectively (-16.4% and -7.4%, respectively, in constant currency). 31 Gross profit margin was stable in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. The stability was primarily due to increased activity in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement services which balanced out the unfavorable impact of decreased activity in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services. Gross profit margin increased in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a higher percentage of the revenue mix coming from our higher-margin Talent Solutions Outplacement services and increased margins in our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 11.2% (9.1% in constant currency and 7.3% in organic constant currency) during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs, $6.0 million in restructuring costs incurred in the second quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the second quarter of 2022 and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by a combination of decreases to bonuses and sales commissions and office related costs. Selling and administrative expenses increased 6.8% (8.2% in constant currency and 6.4% in organic constant currency) during the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs and $6.4 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first half of 2023 compared to zero in the first half of 2022, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets. OUP margin in Southern Europe decreased to 4.2% in the second quarter of 2023 from 5.1% in the second quarter of 2022. In France, the OUP margin was 3.9% for the second quarter of 2023 compared to 5.0% for the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in France was due to the increase of selling and administrative expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs and back office initiatives, as well as increased office lease costs. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.9% for the second quarter of 2023 from 7.8% for the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to an increase in the gross profit margin. In Other Southern Europe, the OUP margin decreased to 1.4% for the second quarter of 2023 from 2.7% for the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the combination of increasing selling and administrative expenses, which increased at a faster rate than revenues and gross profit. OUP margin in Southern Europe decreased to 4.2% in the first half of 2023 from 4.7% in the first half of 2022. In France, the OUP margin was 3.9% for the first half of 2023 compared to 4.6% for the first half of 2022. The decrease in France was primarily due to the increase of selling and administrative expenses, which increased at a faster rate than revenues. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.6% for the first half of 2023 from 7.2% for the first half of 2022 primarily due to an increase in the gross profit margin. In Other Southern Europe, the OUP margin decreased to 2.2% for the first half of 2023 from 2.9% for the first half of 2022 primarily due to the combination of increasing selling and administrative expenses, which increased at a faster rate than gross profit. 32 Northern Europe In Northern Europe, the largest country operations include the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 34%, 22%, 15%, 10%, and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues). In the Northern Europe region, revenues from services decreased -7.3% (-6.3% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. Within Northern Europe, we experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, and the Netherlands of -12.0%, -16.4% and -4.4%, respectively (-11.8%, -8.9% and -6.5%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in Germany and Belgium of 5.6% and 7.0% respectively (3.3% and 4.6%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, a -14.7% decrease (-14.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In the Northern Europe region, revenues from services decreased -9.5% (-5.1% in constant currency and -4.9% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. Within the Northern Europe region, we experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, and the Netherlands of -15.7%, -12.8% and -7.3%, respectively (-11.1%, -3.2% and -6.2%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in Germany and Belgium of 1.5% and 0.5% respectively (2.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, a -9.0% decrease (-4.4% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Talent Solutions permanent recruitment and outplacement services. Gross profit margin decreased in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to business mix changes and a reduction in permanent recruitment activity. Gross profit margin increased in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 primarily due to increases in our staffing/interim margins and the increased demand for our higher-margin outplacement services. Selling and administrative expenses increased 4.1% (4.9% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily due to an increase in salary-related costs and $7.7 million in restructuring costs incurred in the second quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1.1% (increase of 3.1% in constant currency and increase of 3.2% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and the disposition of our Russia business of $10.2 million incurred in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by $10.3 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first half of 2023 compared to zero in the first half of 2022 and an increase in salary-related costs. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to -1.0% in the second quarter of 2023 from 1.1% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margin and the combination of increasing selling and administrative expenses and decreasing revenues and gross profit. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to -0.2% in the first half of 2023 from 0.7% in the first half of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues, which decreased at a faster rate than selling and administrative expenses. 33 APME Revenues from services decreased -0.7% (increase of 4.2% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. In Japan (which represents 48% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 5.7% (11.9% in constant currency) due to increased demand in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates. In Australia (which represents 11% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -14.2% (-8.5% in constant currency), primarily due to decreased demand for our Experis interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and Talent Solutions outplacement services. Revenues from services decreased -1.4% (increase of 5.8% in constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. In Japan, revenues from services increased 2.2% (increase of 12.3% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. In Australia, revenues from services decreased -9.4% (-3.6% in constant currency), primarily due to decreased demand for our Experis interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and increased demand for our Talent Solutions permanent recruitment and outplacement services. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2023 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2022 primarily due to an increased business mix of our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement services and increases in the margin for our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.1% (5.3% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily due to increases in various non-personnel costs related to an increase in recruiting and retention efforts as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.2% (7.3% in constant currency) in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. The increase is primarily due to $2.5 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first half of 2023 compared to zero in the first half of 2022 and increases in various non-personnel costs related to an increase in recruiting and retention efforts as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. OUP margin for APME increased to 4.3% in the second quarter of 2023 from 3.7% in the second quarter of 2022 due to an increase in the gross profit margin. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.9% in the first half of 2023 from 3.4% in the first half of 2022 due to an increase in the gross profit margin. 34 Financ ial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance, including Argentina which operates in a hyperinflationary economy. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of June 30, 2023, we had $369.6 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. Cash used in operating activities was $31.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $21.3 million generated during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $246.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $273.5 million utilized during the six months ended June 30, 2022. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,995.2 million as of June 30, 2023 from $5,137.4 million as of December 31, 2022 primarily due to the revenue decline, partly offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") approximated 58 days as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 2 days from December 31, 2022. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll-related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. 36 Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. While this may result in an increase in our operating cash flows, longer payment terms and timing of payroll, tax and supplier related payments significantly impact our cash position and cash flows each period, such as we experienced during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Any increase in operating cash flows from an economic slowdown would not be sustained in the event that a downturn continues for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $34.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $41.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The lower expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022 are primarily due to the timing and nature of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the six months ended June 30, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $1.4 million, which represents a contingent consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. Net debt repayments were $5.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to net debt proceeds of $384.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and June 2027, respectively. When those notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets for replacement of those notes. Our $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.53 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.94 to 1 as of June 30, 2023. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2023, we had borrowings of $4.0 million and letters of credit of $0.4 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $595.6 million were available to us under the facility as of June 30, 2023. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of June 30, 2023, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $326.9 million, of which $305.9 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $279.0 million could have been made under these lines as of June 30, 2023. We have assessed our liquidity position as of June 30, 2023 and for the near future. As of June 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $407.6 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, less any outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $279.0 million was available to use as of June 30, 2023. Our €500.0 ($543.4) million notes mature in June 2026, and our €400.0 ($432.7) million notes mature in June 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. 37 The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.47 and $1.36 per share on May 5, 2023 and May 6, 2022, respectively. The 2023 dividends were payable on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022. In August 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. The authorization was in addition to the August 2021 and 2019 Board authorizations to repurchase 4.0 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of $81.9 million, including 25,000 shares at a cost of $2.0 million that were repurchased but not yet settled. During the first six months of 2022, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 0.5 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $160.0 million. As of June 30, 2023, there were 0.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,055.4 million as of June 30, 2023 related to debt, operating leases, severance and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,020.3 million as of December 31, 2022. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $882.7 million and $840.2 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively ($833.9 million and $793.0 million for guarantees, respectively, and $48.8 million and $47.2 million for stand-by letters of credit as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.9 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. We recorded $21.1 million in restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2023. We did not record any restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2022. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we made payments of $12.8 million out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $21.5 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2023.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Balance, December 31, 2022 109.3 Provisions charged to earnings 0.1 Write-offs ( 2.2 ) Translation adjustments 1.3 Balance, March 31, 2023 $ 108.5 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 8 Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we identified several factors related to our Netherlands reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount which triggered us to perform an interim impairment assessment. As a result, we wrote the carrying value of the Netherlands reporting unit down to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $ 50.0 . Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 were a discount rate of 13.5 %, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 0.0 % to 3.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 % and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0 %. Management continues to closely monitor the results of the reporting unit and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. The performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the Netherlands reporting unit. If the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, or if there is continued deterioration in the market due to macroeconomic conditions, some or all of the remaining recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 55.8 as of March 31, 2023, could be subject to further impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2023 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024 . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. 9 (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to March 31, 2023, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 36.1 as of March 31, 2023 and $ 35.6 as of December 31, 2022. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and performance share units. Lower expense in the three months ended March 31, 2023 resulted primarily from lower estimated payouts related to performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 1.7 and $ 0.3 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our annual grant of share-based compensation generally takes place during the first quarter of each fiscal year. The number of shares subject to equity awards granted to employees and members of our Board of Directors, as well as the weighted-average fair value per share, for the 2023 and 2022 annual grants are presented in the table below: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg.

No cash consideration was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $ 3.2 . In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $ 8.0 , of which $ 9.7 was included in selling and administrative expenses and a gain of $ 1.7 was included in interest and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the three months ended March 31, 2022. 11 (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded $ 6.6 in restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2023. We did not record any restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we made payments of $ 5.6 out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 14.2 reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 11.0 $ 0.2 $ — $ 13.2 Severance costs 0.9 0.3 1.1 2.5 0.4 5.2 Other Costs — — 1.4 — — 1.4 Costs paid ( 1.1 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 4.1 ) — ( 0.3 ) ( 5.6 ) Balance, March 31, 2023 $ 0.8 $ 1.2 $ 9.4 $ 2.7 $ 0.1 $ 14.2 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.6 and $ 0.7 as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.9 as of both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 . (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.5 % for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 32.6 % for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The 2023 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75 % to 0.375 % effective January 1, 2023. The 29.5 % effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of March 31, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 80.9 . If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 81.6 . We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2016 through 2023 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of March 31, 2023, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Germany, India, Israel, Korea, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 77.8 $ 91.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 50.9 53.6 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.6 0.7 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 51.6 54.4 Net earnings per share - basic $ 1.53 $ 1.71 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 1.51 $ 1.68 12 There were 0.5 million and 0.2 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive.

(2) Balances related to France were $ 73.3 and $ 74.3 as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 3.7 as of both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 . (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. Right Management is allocated to the reporting units of the countries in which Right Management operates. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balances to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. 13 Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 United States $ 1,085.3 $ 1,085.3 United Kingdom 101.9 100.2 France 80.4 79.5 Netherlands 55.8 55.1 Canada 41.7 41.6 Other reporting units 266.6 266.4 Total goodwill $ 1,631.7 $ 1,628.1 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Defined Benefit Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost $ 3.8 $ 5.1 $ — $ — Interest cost 5.2 2.3 0.1 0.1 Expected return on assets ( 4.6 ) ( 3.9 ) — — Net (gain) loss ( 0.9 ) 0.5 — — Prior service cost (credit) 0.2 0.2 ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) Total benefit cost (credit) $ 3.7 $ 4.2 $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) During the three months ended March 31, 2023, contributions made to our pension plans and retiree health care plan were $ 5.2 and $ 0.3 , respectively. During 2023, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 21.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Foreign currency translation $ ( 322.7 ) $ ( 369.7 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans, net of income taxes of $ 19.1 on both dates ( 132.9 ) ( 132.8 ) Gain on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 8.1 ) and $( 5.3 ), respectively 14.7 53.4 Gain on interest rate swap, net of income taxes of $ 0.4 on both dates 1.3 1.4 Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 20.3 ) and $( 20.4 ), respectively ( 13.0 ) ( 12.2 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.9 on both dates 1.0 1.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 451.6 ) $ ( 458.7 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded no amount for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and expenses of $ 0.5 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 14 The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.47 and $ 1.36 per share on May 5, 2023 and May 6, 2022 , respectively. The 2023 dividends are payable on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023 . The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022 . Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorizations to repurchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 0.4 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of $ 30.0 . During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased 0.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 59.9 . As of March 31, 2023, there were 1.6 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Interest expense $ 18.7 $ 10.4 Interest income ( 8.1 ) ( 2.8 ) Foreign exchange loss 3.1 1.8 Miscellaneous income, net ( 6.2 ) ( 6.7 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 7.5 $ 2.7 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. Our € 500.0 ($ 539.7 ) notes due June 2026 and € 400.0 ($ 429.6 ) notes due June 2027 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of March 31, 2023. 15 In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments which matured in September 2022. In September 2022, we entered into a new cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2023 2022 Euro Notes $ ( 12.3 ) $ 27.3 Cross-currency swaps ( 0.4 ) 2.9 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matured in September 2022 and we simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of September 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of € 300.0 and a fixed rate of 1.936 %, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of €400.0 notes to repay our existing € 400.0 notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of $ 2.0 , which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. 16 The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended March 31, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Three Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2023 2022 from AOCI into Income 2023 2022 Cross-currency swaps $ — $ ( 1.0 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ — $ ( 0.9 ) Forward starting interest swap — — Interest and other expenses, net 0.1 — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at March 31, 2023 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. In September 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in September 2024, which aligns with the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.7975 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Impact of foreign exchange rate changes on the value of the note is offset by gains and losses from the hedges. The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on OCI and earnings for the three months ended March 2023 and 2022: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Three Months Ended March 31, Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2023 2022 Recognized in Income 2023 2022 Intercompany CHF note $ — $ — Interest and other expenses, net $ 0.7 $ ( 2.6 ) Cross-currency swaps ( 1.7 ) — Interest and other expenses, net ( 0.7 ) 2.6 17 Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended March 31, Instrument Recognized in Income 2023 2022 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 0.6 ) $ ( 4.8 ) The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Assets March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net 11.6 13.8 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts Receivable, net — 0.2 Total instruments $ 11.6 $ 14.0 Liabilities March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 539.7 532.7 Euro Notes due in 2027 Long-term debt 429.6 423.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 26.1 25.8 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 0.5 — Total instruments $ 995.9 $ 982.4 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 940.4 and $ 921.7 as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 969.3 and $ 956.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 127.1 and $ 115.3 as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). 18 (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Operating lease expense $ 34.7 $ 32.9 Short-term lease expense 1.1 1.2 Other lease expense (1) 4.1 4.7 Total lease expense $ 39.9 $ 38.8 Other information related to leases was as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2023 2022 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 33.4 $ 33.3 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 30.7 9.5 March 31, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2023 2022 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 381.8 $ 365.7 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 104.7 $ 105.5 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 282.6 266.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 387.3 $ 372.1 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery across the company. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 20 Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 770.0 $ 889.4 Other Americas 360.2 361.8 1,130.2 1,251.2 Southern Europe: France 1,169.3 1,192.4 Italy 422.2 445.0 Other Southern Europe 476.4 556.5 2,067.9 2,193.9 Northern Europe 967.6 1,094.5 APME 605.9 618.2 4,771.6 5,157.8 Intercompany Eliminations ( 19.3 ) ( 14.5 ) Consolidated (b) $ 4,752.3 $ 5,143.3 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 31.1 $ 58.3 Other Americas 17.5 14.5 48.6 72.8 Southern Europe: France 44.9 49.6 Italy 30.7 29.0 Other Southern Europe 14.3 16.6 89.9 95.2 Northern Europe 5.0 3.3 APME 21.1 19.0 164.6 190.3 Corporate expenses ( 37.9 ) ( 42.0 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 8.8 ) ( 9.6 ) Operating profit 117.9 138.7 Interest and other expenses, net ( 7.5 ) ( 2.7 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 110.4 $ 136.0 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.2 and $ 2.9 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 99.3 and $ 110.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 3.9 and $ 3.6 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 250.2 and $ 265.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 21 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 29 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency.

Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the first quarter of 2023, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. By contrast, during periods of increased demand we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. As we concluded the first quarter of 2023, we observed softening demand for staffing services due to increased economic uncertainty. We believe that downside risks to the global economic outlook have continued to increase through the first quarter of 2023, and may worsen in future periods. These economic risks are particularly high in Europe, driven by elevated inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and its related supply chain impacts, and higher interest rates. As Europe represents a significant portion of our operations, we continue to monitor economic conditions in our Southern Europe and Northern Europe regions. The Americas market is also experiencing heightened economic risk and uncertainty, driven primarily by elevated inflation, sensitivity to supply chain impacts, and the United States' sensitivity to rising interest rates, which could impact other countries given the importance of the United States economy. As a result of these factors, we expect the business environment will continue to be challenging for us, especially in the United States and Europe, with many companies delaying hiring decisions or reducing their demand for contingent labor. During the first quarter of 2023, the strength of the dollar, particularly against the Euro, had a -5.4% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.14 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact the translation of reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. 22 During the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, we experienced a -9.7% revenue decrease in the Americas, primarily driven by the decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim business. During the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, revenues decreased -5.7% and -11.6% in Southern Europe and Northern Europe, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim business and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. We experienced a -2.0% revenue decrease in APME in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing/interim business and increased demand for our outplacement services in our Talent Solutions business. From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue decreases in Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. In our Manpower brand, the revenue decrease was primarily due to decreased demand for staffing/interim services and an unfavorable currency exchange rate impact. The revenue decrease in our Experis brand was primarily due to decreased demand for staffing/interim services and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. On an overall basis, the revenue decrease in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by decreased demand for our RPO and MSP offerings relative to the prior year period, as the permanent recruitment environment was exceptionally strong during the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was partially offset by a significant increase in demand for our outplacement services under Right Management. Our gross profit margin improved in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix, particularly in our staffing/interim businesses, and growth in our higher margin outplacement offerings under Right Management. The increase in gross profit margin was also due to a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin professional staffing and Talent Solutions offerings. Our operating profit decreased -15.0% in the first quarter of 2023 while our operating profit margin decreased 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022. Excluding restructuring costs of $6.6 million incurred in the first quarter of 2023, the loss of $9.7 million in selling and administrative expenses from the disposition of our Russia business in the first quarter of 2022, and acquisition integration costs of $3.7 million incurred in the first quarter of 2022, our operating profit decreased 18.2% while operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022. The operating profit margin decreased primarily because we did not reduce selling and administrative expenses for the quarter as quickly as the decline in revenues that we experienced.

(in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 4,752.3 $ 5,143.3 (7.6 )% (2.2 )% Cost of services 3,889.2 4,246.2 (8.4 )% (2.9 )% Gross profit 863.1 897.1 (3.8 )% 1.3 % Gross profit margin 18.2 % 17.4 % Selling and administrative expenses 745.2 758.4 (1.7 )% 2.9 % Operating profit 117.9 138.7 (15.0 )% (7.4 )% Operating profit margin 2.5 % 2.7 % Interest and other expenses, net 7.5 2.7 180.4 % Earnings before income taxes 110.4 136.0 (18.8 )% (11.5 )% Provision for income taxes 32.6 44.4 (26.5 )% Effective income tax rate 29.5 % 32.6 % Net earnings $ 77.8 $ 91.6 (15.1 )% (7.4 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 1.51 $ 1.68 (10.4 )% (2.3 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 51.6 54.4 (5.2 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -7.6% (-2.2% in constant currency and -2.3% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 24 The year-over-year 80 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The -1.7% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2023 (increase of 2.9% in constant currency and 2.4% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to: 25 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to increased foreign exchange loss and increased interest expense due to the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in pension returns. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.5% in the first quarter of 2023, as compared to an effective rate of 32.6% for the first quarter of 2022. The 2023 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.75% to 0.375% effective January 1, 2023. The 29.5% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2023 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $1.51 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1.68 in the first quarter of 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.10, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2023. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 51.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 from 54.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by grants of share-based awards. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased -9.7% (-6.1% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. In the United States (which represents 68% of the America's revenues), revenues from services decreased -13.4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of -30.1%, partially offset by increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased -0.4% (increase of 11.8% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, partially offset by an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 4.7% (10.8% in constant currency). The decrease in Other Americas was driven by revenue decreases in Canada, Colombia, and Peru of -12.2%, -13.9%, and -10.7%, respectively (-6.2%, +4.7%, and -10.5%, respectively, in constant currency), partially offset by revenue increases in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil of 7.5%, 27.9% and 8.5%, respectively (-2.2%, +131.0% and +8.1%, respectively, in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to a higher percentage of the revenue mix coming from our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business and increased margins in our staffing/interim business. The increase was partially offset by decreases in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1.7% (flat in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets and zero acquisition integration costs in the first quarter of 2023 compared to acquisition transaction costs of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decreases were partially offset by $0.9 million of restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the first quarter of 2022, and an increase in salary-related costs. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.3% and 5.8% for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 4.0% in the first quarter of 2023 from 6.6% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to decreases in our permanent recruitment business, decreased operating leverage and a slight decrease in the gross profit margin due to an unfavorable business mix, partially offset by an increase in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.9% in the first quarter of 2023 from 4.0% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement. 26 Southern Europe In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -5.7% (-1.4% in constant currency and -1.8% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. In France (which represents 57% of Southern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -1.9% (increase of 2.5% in constant currency and 1.5% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023. In Italy (which represents 20% of Southern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -5.1% (-0.8% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as supply chain constraints have negatively impacted the demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily construction and logistics, partially offset by a significant increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the anniversary impact of significant revenue growth in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase of 10.7% (15.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -14.4% (-10.3% in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 1.9% (8.0% in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a higher percentage of the revenue mix coming from our higher-margin Right Management Outplacement business and increased margins in our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.5% (increase of 7.3% in constant currency and 5.5% in organic constant currency) during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs and $0.3 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a decrease in bonuses and sales commissions as a result of decreased profitability in certain markets. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.3% for both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. In France, the OUP margin was 3.8% for the first quarter of 2023 compared to 4.2% for the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in France was primarily due to the increase of selling and administrative expenses, which increased as revenues declined. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.3% for the first quarter of 2023 from 6.5% for the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin was 3.0% for both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, the largest country operations include the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 35%, 23%, 15%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues). In the Northern Europe region, revenues from services decreased -11.6% (-3.9% in constant currency and -3.5% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium of -18.9%, -9.2%, -2.3%, -9.9% and -6.0%, respectively (-10.5%, +2.6%, +2.1%, -5.8%, and -1.8%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to a decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease was partially offset by the increased demand for our RPO permanent recruitment services. Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to increases in our staffing/interim margins and the increases in our RPO permanent recruitment services. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -5.8% (increase of 1.5% in constant currency and 1.7% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and the anniversary of the loss on the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by $2.5 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the first quarter of 2022 and an increase in salary-related costs. 27 OUP margin for Northern Europe increased to 0.5% in the first quarter of 2023 from 0.3% in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the anniversary of the loss on the sale of our Russia business and the increase in gross profit margin. APME Revenues from services decreased -2.0% (increase of 7.3% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. In Japan (which represents 47% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -1.0% (increase of 12.7% in constant currency) due to the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand in our Talent Solutions outplacement services. In Australia (which represents 11% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -4.2% (increase of 1.5% in constant currency), primarily due to unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Experis business, partially offset by the increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to an increased business mix of our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement services and increases in the margin for our staffing/interim business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.3% (9.2% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily due to $2.5 million in restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2023 compared to zero in the first quarter of 2022 and increases in various non-personnel costs related to an increase in recruiting and retention efforts as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.5% in the first quarter of 2023 from 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 due to the increase in the gross profit margin. 28 Financ ial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared to 2022 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States $ 770.0 (13.4 )% — (13.4 )% — (13.4 )% Other Americas 360.2 (0.4 )% (12.2 )% 11.8 % — 11.8 % 1,130.2 (9.7 )% (3.6 )% (6.1 )% — (6.1 )% Southern Europe: France 1,169.3 (1.9 )% (4.4 )% 2.5 % 1.0 % 1.5 % Italy 422.2 (5.1 )% (4.3 )% (0.8 )% — (0.8 )% Other Southern Europe 476.4 (14.4 )% (4.1 )% (10.3 )% (0.5 )% (9.8 )% 2,067.9 (5.7 )% (4.3 )% (1.4 )% 0.4 % (1.8 )% Northern Europe 967.6 (11.6 )% (7.7 )% (3.9 )% (0.4 )% (3.5 )% APME 605.9 (2.0 )% (9.3 )% 7.3 % — 7.3 % 4,771.6 Intercompany Eliminations (19.3 ) Consolidated $ 4,752.3 (7.6 )% (5.4 )% (2.2 )% 0.1 % (2.3 )% Gross Profit $ 863.1 (3.8 )% (5.1 )% 1.3 % 0.5 % 0.8 % Selling and Administrative Expenses $ 745.2 (1.7 )% (4.6 )% 2.9 % 0.5 % 2.4 % Operating Profit $ 117.9 (15.0 )% (7.6 )% (7.4 )% 0.9 % (8.3 )% 29 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of March 31, 2023, we had $640.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $124.6 million and $70.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $2.4 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $66.1 million utilized during the three months ended March 31, 2022. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,773.2 million as of March 31, 2023 from $5,137.4 million as of December 31, 2022 primarily due to the revenue decline, partly offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") approximated 56 days as of March 31, 2023, unchanged from December 31, 2022. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll-related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, as we experienced during the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $13.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $19.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The lower expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022 are primarily due to the timing and nature of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $3.2 million. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $8.0 million. Net debt repayments were $10.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $28.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and June 2027, respectively. When those notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets for replacement of those notes. Our $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.96 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.44 to 1 as of March 31, 2023. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. 30 As of March 31, 2023, we had letters of credit of $0.4 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.6 million were available to us under the facility as of March 31, 2023. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of March 31, 2023, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $321.7 million, of which $302.0 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $280.3 million could have been made under these lines as of March 31, 2023. We have assessed our liquidity position as of March 31, 2023 and for the near future. As of March 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $706.7 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, less any outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $280.3 million was available to use as of March 31, 2023. Our €500.0 ($539.7) million notes mature in June 2026, and our €400.0 ($429.6) million notes mature in June 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.47 and $1.36 per share on May 5, 2023 and May 6, 2022, respectively. The 2023 dividends are payable on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022. Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorizations to repurchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 0.4 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of $30.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased 0.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $59.9 million. As of March 31, 2023, there were 1.6 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,047.4 million as of March 31, 2023 related to debt, operating leases, severance and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,020.3 million as of December 31, 2022. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $784.3 million and $840.2 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively ($736.1 million and $793.0 million for guarantees, respectively, and $48.2 million and $47.2 million for stand-by letters of credit as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.0 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recorded $6.6 million in restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2023. We did not record any restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we made payments of $5.6 million out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $14.2 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. 31 Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consoli dated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 121.6 Provisions charged to earnings 7.2 Write-offs ( 7.2 ) Translation adjustments ( 13.9 ) Balance, September 30, 2022 $ 107.7 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 9 Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2022 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The table below provides our reporting units' estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 85% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2022. (in millions) United States France United Kingdom Canada Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 2,650.4 $ 2,372.2 $ 359.0 $ 240.7 $ 115.1 Carrying values 1,758.5 841.4 249.9 127.1 115.0 The fair value of each reporting unit at the time of our annual impairment test was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that approximated its carrying value. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2022 included a discount rate of 12.5 %, revenue growth for the next 10 years ranging from 3.0 % to 8.4 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 4.0 %. Management continues to closely monitor the results of the reporting unit and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. The performance of the Netherlands reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for impairment in the Netherlands reporting unit. If the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, or if there is deterioration in the market due to macroeconomic conditions, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 96.8 as of September 30, 2022, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2022 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures by business entities about government assistance. The guidance requires business entities to disclose, in notes to their financial statements, information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2022 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022 . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. 10 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2023 . We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to September 30, 2022, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 0.4 and $ 5.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 18.1 and $ 13.3 , respectively. The 2022 payments primarily represent a consideration payment for the acquisition of Tingari, a talent solutions company in France, and contingent consideration payments associated with previous acquisitions. The 2021 payments mainly relate to franchise acquisitions in the United States and a contingent consideratio n payment associated with a previous acquisition. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $ 3.2 and simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new owner of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $ 8.0 . On September 30, 2022, our Belgium business disposed of its Service Voucher Division and recognized a one-time gain of $ 4.1 . On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 930.9 . Of the total consideration paid, $ 925.0 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 5.9 was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $ 150.0 draw on our revolving credit facility, which was fully repaid as of September 30, 2022. We finalized the purchase accounting as of September 30, 2022 and recognized post-closing working capital adjustments of $ 3.4 and income tax adjustments of $ 3.1 with a corresponding offset to goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the final fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents $ 14.6 Accounts receivable 132.6 Prepaid expenses and other assets 2.6 Operating lease right-of-use asset 8.7 Goodwill 513.1 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 360.0 Accounts payable ( 21.6 ) Employee compensation payable ( 14.8 ) Accrued liabilities ( 28.7 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 6.9 ) Value added taxes payable ( 3.0 ) Long-term operating lease liability ( 5.3 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 20.4 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 930.9 13 The customer relationship intangible asset will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, the carrying value of intangible assets were $ 354.0 and $ 336.0 , respectively, and the carrying value of goodwill was $ 519.6 and $ 513.1 , respectively. The goodwill is included within the United States reporting unit and is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies to occur post-acquisition as a result of diversifying the business into higher growth and higher value services. (6) Restructuring Costs We did not record any net restructuring costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 .We recorded restructuring costs of $ 5.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we made payments of $ 10.9 out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 12.4 reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 21.5 $ — $ — $ 23.3 Costs paid ( 0.7 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 9.7 ) — — ( 10.9 ) Balance, September 30, 2022 $ 0.3 $ 0.3 $ 11.8 $ — $ — $ 12.4 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.2 and $ 0.1 as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.6 and $ 0.2 as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.3 and $ 0.1 as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 , respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.0 % for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 32.9 % for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25 % and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 29.0 % effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 30.3 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 33.1 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25 % and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 30.3 % effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of September 30, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 77.2 . If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . As of December 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 71.8 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2015 through 2022 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of September 30, 2022, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Germany, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 14 (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 111.3 $ 97.7 $ 325.1 $ 271.3 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 51.7 54.3 52.6 54.7 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.2 0.1 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 52.3 55.2 53.3 55.4 Net earnings per share - basic $ 2.15 $ 1.80 $ 6.18 $ 4.96 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 2.13 $ 1.77 $ 6.10 $ 4.90 There were 0.7 million and 0.1 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. There were 0.5 million and 0.2 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,640.4 $ — $ 1,640.4 $ 1,722.2 $ — $ 1,722.2 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 806.6 $ 430.2 $ 376.4 $ 823.4 $ 421.6 $ 401.8 Other 20.8 19.1 1.7 23.2 19.7 3.5 827.4 449.3 378.1 846.6 441.3 405.3 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 123.8 — 123.8 126.3 — 126.3 175.8 — 175.8 178.3 — 178.3 Total intangible assets $ 1,003.2 $ 449.3 $ 553.9 $ 1,024.9 $ 441.3 $ 583.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as o f both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2022 is expected to be $ 9.3 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2023 - $ 33.5 , 2024 - $ 31.7 , 2025 - $ 29.8 , 2026 - $ 26.5 and 2027 - $ 25.9 . 15 Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1,058.9 $ 146.7 $ 313.7 $ 76.9 $ 126.0 $ 1,722.2 Acquisitions ( 6.5 ) 8.6 — — — 2.1 Currency impact ( 4.0 ) ( 18.2 ) ( 51.3 ) ( 10.4 ) — ( 83.9 ) Balance, September 30, 2022 $ 1,048.4 $ 137.1 $ 262.4 $ 66.5 $ 126.0 $ 1,640.4 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 1,013.0 and $ 1,006.5 as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Reduction for acquisitions represents post-closing opening balance adjustments related to the United States Experis acquisition. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (2) Balances related to France were $ 68.2 and $ 67.1 as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 3.9 and $ 3.4 as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 , respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. Right Management is allocated to the reporting units of the countries in which Right Management operates. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balances to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2022 2021 United States $ 1,085.3 $ 1,091.7 Netherlands 96.8 112.2 United Kingdom 93.4 110.7 France 73.2 74.3 Canada 40.8 44.5 Other reporting units 250.9 288.8 Total goodwill $ 1,640.4 $ 1,722.2 (10) Debt On May 27, 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of May 27, 2027 to replace our previous $ 600.0 revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a new $ 600.0 five-year revolving credit facility and includes terms generally consistent with our previous credit facility, except the Credit Agreement uses Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base rate index instead of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 10 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 102.5 basis points on any borrowings. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgements, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. 16 On June 30, 2022, we offered and sold € 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.50 % notes due June 30, 2027 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the Notes were used in July 2022 to repay our € 400.0 1.875 % notes due September 11, 2022. The Notes were issued at a price of 99.465 % to yield an effective interest rate o f 3.514 %, net of a favorable impact of a forward starting interest rate swap. I nterest on the Notes is payable in arrears on June 30 of each year. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. (11) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost $ 4.7 $ 5.5 $ 14.7 $ 16.6 Interest cost 2.1 1.5 6.6 4.6 Expected return on assets ( 3.6 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 11.1 ) ( 9.2 ) Net loss 0.5 — 1.4 — Prior service cost 0.2 1.4 0.5 4.1 Total benefit cost $ 3.9 $ 5.3 $ 12.1 $ 16.1 Retiree Health Care Plan Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest cost 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Prior service credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 0.6 ) Net loss — — 0.1 0.1 Total benefit credit $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.3 ) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, contributions made to our pension plans were $ 1.3 and $ 5.8 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 and $ 0.9 , respectively. During 2022, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. (12) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency translation $ ( 486.7 ) $ ( 180.8 ) Translation gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of income taxes (benefit) of $ 19.8 and $( 16.4 ), respectively 139.6 ( 18.4 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 132.5 ) ( 133.6 ) Gain on interest rate swap 1.9 — Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 22.2 ) and $( 22.8 ), respectively ( 55.2 ) ( 56.7 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.5 and $ 1.6 , respectively ( 0.3 ) 0.1 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 533.2 ) $ ( 389.4 ) 17 Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a benefit of $ 0.1 and an expense of $ 0.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and an expense of $ 0.6 and a benefit of $ 1.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.36 and $ 1.26 per share on May 6, 2022 and May 7 , 2021 , respectively. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022 . The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021 . Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased a total of 2.8 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 1.6 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $ 245.0 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 150.1 . As of September 30, 2022, there were 2.4 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. (13) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest expense $ 10.7 $ 9.6 $ 31.7 $ 29.5 Interest income ( 4.4 ) ( 2.9 ) ( 10.0 ) ( 9.1 ) Foreign exchange loss 3.8 1.4 8.9 4.5 Miscellaneous income, net ( 5.4 ) ( 3.2 ) ( 16.5 ) ( 11.8 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 4.7 $ 4.9 $ 14.1 $ 13.1 (14) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. 18 Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 387.8 ) notes due June 2027 and the € 500.0 ($ 487.2 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of September 30, 2022. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments which matured in September 2022. In September 2022, we entered into a new cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2022 2021 2022 2021 Euro Notes $ 61.4 $ 24.6 $ 141.2 $ 57.0 Cross-currency swaps 12.2 1.6 23.4 14.9 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matured in September 2022 and we simultaneously entered into new cross-currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of September 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. 19 We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. In September 2021, we entered into a series of forward currency exchange contracts denominated in GBP. The economic effect of the forward is to eliminate the uncertainty in cash flows in GBP associated with a portion of our forecasted IT contract spend in 2022 by fixing the amount at £ 6.0 . Gains and losses from the hedge offset the foreign currency exchange impact of the contracts. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of € 300.0 and a fixed rate of 1.936 %, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of €400.0 notes to repay our existing € 400.0 notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of $ 2.0 , which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Three Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2022 2021 from AOCI into Income 2022 2021 Cross-currency swaps $ 2.2 $ 4.0 Interest and other expenses, net $ 2.1 $ 3.9 Foreign currency forward contracts 0.1 ( 0.2 ) Selling and administrative expenses ( 0.3 ) — Forward starting interest swap — — Interest and other expenses, net 0.1 — Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Nine Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2022 2021 from AOCI into Income 2022 2021 Cross-currency swaps $ 4.5 $ 0.9 Interest and other expenses, net $ 4.2 $ 0.7 Foreign currency forward contracts ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) Selling and administrative expenses ( 0.6 ) — Forward starting interest swap 2.0 — Interest and other expenses, net 0.1 — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at September 30, 2022 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. 20 Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. In September 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in September 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.7975 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal on the note due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument Recognized in Income 2022 2021 2022 2021 Intercompany CHF note Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 8.4 ) $ — $ ( 16.1 ) $ — Cross-currency swaps Interest and other expenses, net 8.8 — 16.1 — Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was as follows: Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Location of Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument Recognized in Income 2022 2021 2022 2021 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 14.7 ) $ ( 3.0 ) $ ( 27.9 ) $ ( 8.5 ) 21 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Assets September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net $ 1.8 $ — Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net — 24.7 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net 17.4 — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts Receivable, net 1.4 — Total instruments $ 20.6 $ 24.7 Liabilities September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2022 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt $ — $ 454.4 Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 487.2 565.2 Euro Notes due in 2027 Long-term debt 387.8 — Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities — 24.2 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 0.4 0.2 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities — 5.5 Total instruments $ 875.4 $ 1,049.5 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 826.8 and $ 1,064.0 as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 875.0 and $ 1,019.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 109.2 and $ 138.0 as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). 22 (15) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Operating lease expense $ 32.1 $ 35.1 $ 96.1 $ 105.5 Short-term lease expense 1.7 1.4 4.3 4.5 Other lease expense (1) 1.3 4.6 10.3 13.6 Total lease expense $ 35.1 $ 41.1 $ 110.7 $ 123.6 Other information related to leases was as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 93.4 $ 104.7 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 37.5 35.9 September 30, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2022 2021 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 306.7 $ 373.4 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 96.4 $ 110.0 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 216.9 275.8 Total operating lease liabilities $ 313.3 $ 385.8 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery across the company. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 24 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 886.6 $ 644.9 $ 2,679.9 $ 1,882.5 Other Americas 353.2 352.7 1,073.8 1,162.3 1,239.8 997.6 3,753.7 3,044.8 Southern Europe: France 1,159.5 1,317.0 3,590.1 3,852.7 Italy 395.1 456.4 1,294.4 1,328.3 Other Southern Europe 485.2 609.2 1,550.6 1,784.3 2,039.8 2,382.6 6,435.1 6,965.3 Northern Europe 954.1 1,166.6 3,075.7 3,490.9 APME 586.9 611.2 1,808.8 1,858.5 4,820.6 5,158.0 15,073.3 15,359.5 Intercompany Eliminations ( 19.7 ) ( 17.4 ) ( 55.0 ) ( 17.4 ) Consolidated (b) $ 4,800.9 $ 5,140.6 $ 15,018.3 $ 15,342.1 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 54.7 $ 28.2 $ 177.7 $ 95.4 Other Americas 16.4 12.6 47.1 45.5 71.1 40.8 224.8 140.9 Southern Europe: France 56.6 61.6 168.5 169.9 Italy 29.0 30.8 93.5 81.9 Other Southern Europe 14.7 18.3 45.2 47.6 100.3 110.7 307.2 299.4 Northern Europe 12.8 16.5 26.9 39.2 APME 23.4 22.6 64.9 63.7 207.6 190.6 623.8 543.2 Corporate expenses ( 37.0 ) ( 36.0 ) ( 114.8 ) ( 110.5 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 9.1 ) ( 4.1 ) ( 28.1 ) ( 13.9 ) Operating profit 161.5 150.5 480.9 418.8 Interest and other expenses, net ( 4.7 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 14.1 ) ( 13.1 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 156.8 $ 145.6 $ 466.8 $ 405.7 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.7 and $ 3.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 9.7 and $ 9.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 121.9 and $ 121.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 360.8 and $ 353.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 4.4 and $ 3.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 11.9 and $ 11.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 264.0 and $ 253.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 804.8 and $ 755.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 25 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 37 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a ""forward-looking statement""). Statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” and other similar expressions. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A – Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2021, as well as the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions and the Company’s efforts to respond to such impacts; volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions, including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, any sanction, supply chain disruptions or increased economic uncertainty related to the ongoing conflict; changes in labor and tax legislation in places we do business; failure to implement strategic technology investments; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise. We caution that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, as we experienced in the third quarter of 2022, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. As we concluded the third quarter of 2022, we observed strong labor markets and continued solid demand. However, we also believe that downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased significantly. This economic risk is particularly high in Europe, driven by elevated inflation, rising energy prices, the Russia-Ukraine war and higher interest rates. Within Europe, Germany's industrial economy is especially sensitive to increases in energy costs, which could impact other countries given the importance of the German economy. As Europe represents a significant portion of our operations, we continue to monitor economic conditions in our Southern Europe and Northern Europe regions. During the third quarter of 2022, the significant strengthening of the dollar, particularly against the Euro, had a 12.0% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.32 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact the translation of reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. 26 During the third quarter of 2022, we experienced a 24.3% revenue increase in the Americas, primarily driven by our acquisition of the ettain group in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021, which now operates as part of our Experis brand, and increased demand for our staffing/interim services. We refer to the ettain group acquisition as the ""Experis acquisition."" During the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021, revenues decreased -14.4% and -18.2% in Southern Europe and Northern Europe, respectively, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates and a decrease in our Manpower staffing/interim business. We experienced a -4.0% revenue decrease in APME in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to the unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing/interim and Experis business. From a brand perspective, we experienced a revenue decrease in Manpower, and revenue increases in Experis and Talent Solutions during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. The revenue decrease in our Manpower brand was due to the unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by solid demand for staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the Experis acquisition in the United States, improved demand for our interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our RPO services as the permanent recruitment environment was strong during the quarter. Our gross profit margin improved in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix, particularly in our staffing/interim businesses, and growth in higher margin offerings including our permanent recruitment business which grew 16.1% (27.9% in constant currency and 26.7% in organic constant currency). The increase in gross profit margin was also due a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin professional staffing and Talent Solutions offerings, including from the Experis acquisition. We recorded integration costs of $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2022 relating to our Experis acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our operating profit increased 7.4% in the third quarter of 2022 while our operating profit margin increased 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2021. Excluding Experis acquisition integration costs of $5.6 incurred in the third quarter of 2022 and restructuring costs and Experis acquisition transaction costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021, our operating profit increased 3.2% while operating profit margin increased 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2021. The operating profit margin increased primarily due to the improvement in our gross profit margin as a result of an improved business mix. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 27 Operating Results - Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to 2021.

Interest and other expenses, net was $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to an increase in pension returns and a favorable true-up of the estimate on a non-controlling interest buy-out, partially offset by increased foreign exchange loss. 29 We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.0% in the third quarter of 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 32.9% for the third quarter of 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25% and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 29.0% effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $2.13 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.77 in the third quarter of 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.32 per share in the third quarter of 2022. The Experis acquisition integration costs in the third quarter of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.08, net of tax. Restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.07, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2021. The Experis acquisition transaction costs in the third quarter of 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2021. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 52.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 from 55.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by shares issued as a result of vesting of share-based awards. Operating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to 2021.

Interest and other expenses, net was $14.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $13.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the increase in the returns on pension plan assets, a translation gain from the sale of a subsidiary and a favorable true-up of estimate on a non-controlling interest buy-out, partially offset by increased foreign exchange loss. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 30.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to an effective rate of 33.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25% and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 30.3% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $6.10 in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $4.90 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.67 per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The net loss from the disposition of our Russia business in the first half of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.15 in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Experis acquisition integration costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.18, net of tax. Restructuring costs recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 negatively impacted net earnings (loss) per share – diluted by approximately $0.07, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The acquisition transaction costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 53.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 55.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by shares issued as a result of vesting of share-based awards. 32 Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 24.3% (27.1% in constant currency and 7.8% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. In the United States (which represents 72% of the America's revenues), revenues from services increased 37.5% (7.6% on an organic basis) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis staffing/interim services including the significant contribution to revenues from our Experis acquisition and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 34.7% (27.4% on an organic basis). In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 0.1% (8.1% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 34.7% (35.9% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. We experienced revenue increases in Canada, Argentina, Peru and Chile of 1.6%, 30.4%, 1.5%, and 5.4%, respectively (5.3%, 82.0%, -2.4% and 26.3%, respectively, in constant currency), partially offset by revenue decreases in Mexico and Colombia of -26.4% and -2.7%, respectively (-25.6% and 11.0%, respectively, in constant currency). In the Americas, revenues from services increased 23.3% (25.1% in constant currency and 6.1% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. In the United States, revenues from services increased 42.4% (11.6% on an organic basis) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis staffing/interim services including the significant contribution to revenues from our Experis acquisition and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 65.4% (54.7% on an organic basis). In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased -7.6% (-2.8% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to decreased demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 57.5% (63.1% in constant currency). This decline was driven by a decrease in Mexico of -54.0% (-53.7% in constant currency), primarily due to labor legislation implemented in the third quarter of 2021. The decline was partially offset by increases in Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile of 7.8%, 21.4%, 10.0%, 5.9% and 19.9%, respectively (10.5%, 50.1%, 20.9%, 5.6% and 39.2%, respectively, in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in our permanent recruitment business, improvements in the staffing/interim margins, the Experis acquisition and increases in revenues from our higher-margin professional staffing and Talent Solutions offerings in the United States. These increases were partially offset by a lower percentage of the revenue mix coming from the higher-margin Right Management career transition business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 22.4% (23.8% in constant currency and 11.1% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the Experis acquisition and an increase in salary-related costs as a result of a higher headcount as we invested in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity. The increase in salary-related costs was also due to an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. The increases were partially offset by Experis acquisition integration costs of $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to Experis acquisition transaction costs of $6.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 and restructuring costs of $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2021. Selling and administrative expenses increased 30.8% (31.8% in constant currency and 17.5% in organic constant currency) during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the Experis acquisition, an increase in salary-related costs as a result of a higher headcount as we invested in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity and an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology initiatives. The increase in salary-related costs was also due to an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. The increases were also due to Experis acquisition integration costs of $12.0 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to Experis acquisition transaction costs of $6.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, partially offset by restructuring costs of $5.3 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 33 Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 5.7% and 4.1% for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 6.2% in the third quarter of 2022 from 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to increases in our permanent recruitment business, the Experis acquisition, increased operating leverage and an increase in the gross profit margin due to a favorable business mix, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.7% in the third quarter of 2022 from 3.6% in the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 6.0% and 4.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 6.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 5.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in our permanent recruitment business, the Experis acquisition, increased operating leverage and an increase in the gross profit margin due to a favorable business mix, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount and Experis acquisition integration costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 3.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -14.4% ( -0.7% in constant currency and -1.1% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, revenues from services decreased -12.0% (increases of 3.1% in constant currency and 2.3% in organic constant currency) in France (which represents 57% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased -13.4% (increase of 1.4% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 19% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints have negatively impacted the demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily automotive and construction, and to a lesser degree, logistics. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the anniversary impact of significant revenue growth in the prior year period, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -20.3% (-10.3% in constant currency) during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis business services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 11.6% (29.6% in constant currency). In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -7.6% (increases of 3.2% in constant currency and 3.0% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, revenues from services decreased -6.8% (increases of 4.9% in constant currency and 4.6% in organic constant currency) in France and decreased -2.6% (increase of 9.5% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints have negatively impacted the demand for our services in certain sectors, primarily automotive and construction, and to a lesser degree, logistics, and a 13.1% increase (27.0% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and Experis interim services and a 19.8% increase (34.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -13.1% (-5.3% in constant currency) during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis business services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 22.4% (36.1% in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due the increases in our permanent recruitment business and increases in our staffing/interim margins across our key markets. 34 Selling and administrative expenses decreased -7.6% (increase of 7.2% in constant currency and 4.9% in organic constant currency) during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support continued investments in markets where we see opportunities and an increase in higher non-personnel related costs to support the growth in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -4.0% (increase of 7.1% in constant currency and 6.3% in organic constant currency) during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the period, and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.9% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 4.6% for the third quarter of 2021. In France, the OUP margin was 4.9% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 4.7% for the third quarter of 2021. The increase in France was primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.3% for the third quarter of 2022 from 6.7% for the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin and our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin was 3.0% in the third quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2021. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 4.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. In France, the OUP margin was 4.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 4.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 6.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 2.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 2.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, the largest country operations include the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 37%, 23%, 13%, 10%, and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues). In the region, revenues from services decreased -18.2% (-3.9% in constant currency and -1.2% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium of -18.3%, -10.0%, -25.4%, -19.9% and -11.8%, respectively (-4.2%, +5.9%, -12.6%, -6.3%, and +3.2%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the disposition of our Russia business and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the 15.5% increase (36.4% in constant currency and 39.7% in organic constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Northern Europe, revenues from services decreased -11.9% (-1.5% in constant currency and increased 0.9% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium of -12.3%, -2.2%, -18.3%, -15.0% and -7.4% respectively (-3.5%, +10.5, -8.2%, -4.6% and +4.3%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the sale of our Russia business, and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis staffing services and the 30.5% increase (46.6% in constant currency and 49.5% in organic constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. Gross profit margin increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increases in our staffing/interim margins and the increases in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -7.9% (increase of 8.2% in constant currency and 9.6% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decrease is primarily due the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount. 35 Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.2% (12.3% in constant currency and 13.5% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount, the loss on the sale of our Russia business, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues, partially offset by the favorable impact of change in currency exchange rates. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 1.3% in the third quarter of 2022 from 1.4% in the third quarter of 2021. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 0.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 1.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decreases were primarily due to the loss on the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by the increase in gross profit margin. APME Revenues from services decreased -4.0% (increase of 12.0% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. In Japan (which represents 44% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -10.7% (increase of 12.2% in constant currency) due to the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand in our staffing/interim services. In Australia (which represents 13% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 3.3% (11.1% in constant currency), primarily due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is primarily due the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and our Experis business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates. Revenues from services decreased -2.7% (increase of 9.2% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. In Japan, revenues from services decreased -4.5% (increase of 12.4% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Experis business, and an increased demand for our Manpower staffing services. In Australia, revenues from services decreased -16.6% (-10.5% in constant currency) due to the exit of a low margin client arrangement in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is primarily due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and our Experis business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the increase in our staffing/interim margins and the increases in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -5.5% (increase of 9.1% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increases in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support increases in revenues, increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -0.9% (increase of 10.6% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support increases in revenues, increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. OUP margin for APME increased to 4.0% in the third quarter of 2022 from 3.7% in the third quarter of 2021 due to the increase in the gross profit margin. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 3.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to the increase in the gross profit margin. 36 Financ ial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of September 30, 2022, we had $455.6 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $289.2 million and $382.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $141.6 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $40.8 million generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. These changes were primarily attributable to the revenue growth and decrease in accounts payable due to timing. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,720.3 million as of September 30, 2022 from $5,448.2 million as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by four days to 59 days as of September 30, 2022 from December 31, 2021 due to higher activity levels and to longer payment term mix impacts, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, as we experienced during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2022 compared to 2021 are primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $18.1 million and $13.3 million, respectively. The 2022 payments primarily represent a consideration payment for the acquisition of Tingari, a talent solutions company in France, and contingent consideration payments associated with previous acquisitions. The 2021 payments mainly relate to franchise acquisitions in the United States and a contingent consideration payment associated with a previous acquisition. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall capital efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $3.2 million. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $8.0 million. On September 30, 2022, our Belgium business disposed of its Service Voucher Division and recognized a one-time gain of $4.1 million. 39 Net debt repayments were $67.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $1.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in 2022 is due to the $75.0 million repayment we made into our revolving credit facility to clear the outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2021 related to the Experis acquisition. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand and a $150.0 million draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. On June 30, 2022, we offered and sold €400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.50% notes due June 30, 2027 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the Notes were used in July 2022 to repay our €400.0 million 1.875% notes due September 11, 2022. The Notes were issued at a price of 99.465% to yield an effective interest rate of 3.514%, net of a favorable impact of a forward starting interest rate swap. Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on June 30 of each year. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €500.0 million notes are due June 2026. When the €500.0 million notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets for replacement of the €500.0 million notes. On May 27, 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of May 27, 2027 to replace our previous $600.0 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and includes terms generally consistent with our previous credit facility, except the Credit Agreement uses Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base rate index instead of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 10 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 102.5 basis points on any borrowings. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgements, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.99 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.91 to 1 as of September 30, 2022. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2022, we had letters of credit of $0.4 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.6 million were available to us under the facility as of September 30, 2022. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of September 30, 2022, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $304.1 million, of which $283.0 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. We have assessed our liquidity position as of September 30, 2022 and for the near future. As of September 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $527.5 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, less any outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $283.0 million was available to use as of September 30, 2022. Our €500.0 ($487.3) million notes mature in June 2026, and our €400.0 ($387.8) million notes mature in June 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. 40 The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.36 and $1.26 per share, respectively, on May 6, 2022 and May 7, 2021, respectively. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022. The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021. In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased a total of 2.8 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 1.6 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $245.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $150.1 million. As of September 30, 2022, there were 2.4 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $1,864.1 million as of September 30, 2022 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,156.7 million as of December 31, 2021. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $789.3 million and $769.3 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively ($741.7 million and $717.7 million for guarantees, respectively, and $47.6 million and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We did not record any net restructuring costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.We recorded restructuring costs of $5.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we made payments of $10.9 million out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $12.4 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. 41 Application of Critical Accounting Policies In accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below carrying value. Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be a component of the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2022 and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests. Refer to Note 1 for results of our annual goodwill impairment testing. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consoli dated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 121.6 Provisions charged to earnings 6.1 Write-offs ( 4.3 ) Translation adjustments ( 7.5 ) Balance, June 30, 2022 $ 115.9 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 9 Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of each reporting unit at the time of our annual impairment test was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.5 %. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2021 included a discount rate of 10.4 %, revenue growth for the next three years ranging from 3.0 % - 5.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. During the second quarter of 2022 we considered the impact of increasing interest rates and the impact of a lower near-term forecast for the Netherlands reporting unit within the current valuation model ahead of our annual impairment test in the third quarter and concluded no triggering event was identified. Management continues to closely monitor the results of the reporting unit and trending against the forecast, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting unit. If the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 103.5 as of June 30, 2022, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2022 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures by business entities about government assistance. The guidance requires business entities to disclose, in notes to their financial statements, information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2022 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022 . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. 10 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2023 . We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to June 30, 2022, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 27.3 as of June 30, 2022 and $ 34.8 as of December 31, 2021. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types.

For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 1.4 and $ 13.3 , respectively. The 2022 payment represents a contingent consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. The 2021 payments represent consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideratio n payments related to previous acquisitions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $ 3.2 and simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new owner of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $ 8.0 . On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 930.9 . Of the total consideration paid, $ 925.0 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 5.9 was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $ 150.0 draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we recognized post-closing working capital adjustments of $ 4.6 with a corresponding offset to goodwill. We expect to finalize the accounting for income tax related items and working capital adjustments during the third quarter of 2022. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the updated fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents $ 14.6 Accounts receivable 132.4 Prepaid expenses and other assets 2.4 Operating lease right-of-use asset 8.7 Goodwill 515.0 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 360.0 Accounts payable ( 21.4 ) Employee compensation payable ( 15.0 ) Accrued liabilities ( 29.7 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 6.9 ) Value added taxes payable ( 5.5 ) Long-term operating lease liability ( 5.3 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 18.4 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 930.9 13 The customer relationship intangible asset will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the carrying value of intangible assets were $ 354.0 and $ 342.0 , respectively, and the carrying value of goodwill was $ 519.6 and $ 515.0 , respectively. The goodwill is included within the United States reporting unit and is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies to occur post-acquisition as a result of diversifying the business into higher growth and higher value services. (6) Restructuring Costs We did not record any restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2022 or 2021. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we made payments of $ 6.8 out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 16.5 reserve will be paid by the end of 2023. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 21.5 $ — $ — $ 23.3 Costs paid ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 6.2 ) — — ( 6.8 ) Balance, June 30, 2022 $ 0.8 $ 0.4 $ 15.3 $ — $ — $ 16.5 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.2 and $ 0.2 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.6 and $ 0.2 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.3 and $ 0.2 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022 , respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.8 % for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 33.2 % for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25 % and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 29.8% effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 31.0 % for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 33.3 % for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25 % and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 31.0% effective tax rate for the first half of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of June 30, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 72.6 . If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . As of December 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 71.8 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2015 through 2022 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of June 30, 2022, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Germany, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 14 (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 122.2 $ 111.6 $ 213.8 $ 173.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 52.7 54.5 53.2 54.8 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 0.2 — 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 53.4 55.4 53.8 55.5 Net earnings per share - basic $ 2.32 $ 2.05 $ 4.02 $ 3.17 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 2.29 $ 2.02 $ 3.97 $ 3.13 There were 0.5 million and 0.1 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. There were 0.3 million and 0.2 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,669.9 $ — $ 1,669.9 $ 1,722.2 $ — $ 1,722.2 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 811.5 $ 429.6 $ 381.9 $ 823.4 $ 421.6 $ 401.8 Other 21.1 19.1 2.0 23.2 19.7 3.5 832.6 448.7 383.9 846.6 441.3 405.3 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 125.0 — 125.0 126.3 — 126.3 177.0 — 177.0 178.3 — 178.3 Total intangible assets $ 1,009.6 $ 448.7 $ 560.9 $ 1,024.9 $ 441.3 $ 583.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as o f both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2022 is expected to be $ 18.2 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2023 - $ 33.5 , 2024 - $ 31.5 , 2025 - $ 29.6 , 2026 - $ 26.1 and 2027 - $ 25.5 . 15 Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1,058.9 $ 146.7 $ 313.7 $ 76.9 $ 126.0 $ 1,722.2 Acquisitions (4) ( 4.6 ) — — — — ( 4.6 ) Currency impact ( 1.1 ) ( 10.6 ) ( 29.3 ) ( 6.7 ) — ( 47.7 ) Balance, June 30, 2022 $ 1,053.2 $ 136.1 $ 284.4 $ 70.2 $ 126.0 $ 1,669.9 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 1,013.0 and $ 1,008.3 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 68.2 and $ 62.9 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 3.9 and $ 3.6 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022 , respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. Right Management is allocated to the reporting units of the countries in which Right Management operates. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balances to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. (4) Represents post-closing working capital adjustments related to the United States Experis acquisition. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2022 2021 United States $ 1,087.0 $ 1,091.7 Netherlands 103.5 112.2 United Kingdom 100.8 110.7 France 69.0 74.3 Sweden 36.9 41.4 Other reporting units 272.7 291.9 Total goodwill $ 1,669.9 $ 1,722.2 (10) Debt On May 27, 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of May 27, 2027 to replace our previous $ 600.0 revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a new $ 600.0 five-year revolving credit facility and includes terms generally consistent with our previous credit facility, except the Credit Agreement uses Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base rate index instead of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 10 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 102.5 basis points on any borrowings. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgements, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. 16 On June 30, 2022, we offered and sold € 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.50 % notes due June 30, 2027 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the Notes were used in July 2022 to repay our € 400.0 1.875 % notes due September 11, 2022. The Notes were issued at a price of 99.465 % to yield an effective interest rate o f 3.514 %, net of a favorable impact of a forward starting interest rate swap. I nterest on the Notes is payable in arrears on June 30 of each year. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. (11) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost $ 4.9 $ 5.5 $ 10.0 $ 11.1 Interest cost 2.2 1.6 4.5 3.1 Expected return on assets ( 3.6 ) ( 3.0 ) ( 7.5 ) ( 6.1 ) Net loss 0.4 1.1 0.9 2.3 Prior service cost 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Total benefit cost $ 4.0 $ 5.4 $ 8.2 $ 10.8 Retiree Health Care Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest cost $ — $ — $ 0.1 $ 0.1 Prior service credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) Net Loss 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total benefit credit $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.2 ) $ ( 0.2 ) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 , contributions made to our pension plans were $ 2.4 and $ 4.5 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 and $ 0.6 , respectively. During 2022, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. (12) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency translation $ ( 338.8 ) $ ( 180.8 ) Translation gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of income taxes (benefit) of $ 4.3 and $( 16.4 ), respectively 53.2 ( 18.4 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 132.1 ) ( 133.6 ) Gain on interest rate swap 2.0 — Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 22.4 ) and $( 22.8 ), respectively ( 55.6 ) ( 56.7 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.5 and $ 1.6 , respectively ( 0.2 ) 0.1 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 471.5 ) $ ( 389.4 ) 17 Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 0.2 and a benefit of $ 0.2 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and expenses of $ 0.7 and a benefit of $ 1.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.36 and $ 1.26 per share on May 6, 2022 and May 7 , 2021 , respectively. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022 . The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021 . Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2022, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 0.5 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $ 160.0 . During the first six months of 2021, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 150.1 . As of June 30, 2022, there were 3.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. (13) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Interest expense $ 10.6 $ 9.7 $ 21.0 $ 19.9 Interest income ( 2.8 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 5.6 ) ( 6.2 ) Foreign exchange loss 3.3 0.6 5.1 3.1 Miscellaneous income, net ( 4.4 ) ( 4.4 ) ( 11.1 ) ( 8.6 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 6.7 $ 2.8 $ 9.4 $ 8.2 (14) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. 18 Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 419.2 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 521.2 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of June 30, 2022. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2022 2021 2022 2021 Euro Notes $ 52.5 $ ( 11.3 ) $ 79.8 $ 32.4 Cross-currency swaps 8.3 ( 7.2 ) 11.2 13.3 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which aligns to term of the intercompany note. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. 19 In September 2021, we entered into a series of forward currency exchange contracts denominated in GBP. The economic effect of the forward is to eliminate the uncertainty in cash flows in GBP associated with a portion of our forecasted IT contract spend in 2022 by fixing the amount at £ 6.0 . Gains and losses from the hedge offset the foreign currency exchange impact of the contracts. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of € 300 million and a fixed rate of 1.936 % , which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of €400 million of notes to repay our existing € 400 million notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of $ 2.0 million, which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and which will be amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Three Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2022 2021 from AOCI into Income 2022 2021 Cross-currency swaps $ 3.3 $ 2.2 Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 3.0 ) $ ( 2.0 ) Foreign currency forward contracts ( 0.2 ) — Selling and administrative expenses ( 0.3 ) — Forward starting interest swap 2.0 — Interest and other expenses, net — — Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into Income Six Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2022 2021 from AOCI into Income 2022 2021 Cross-currency swaps $ 2.3 $ ( 3.1 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 2.1 ) $ 3.2 Foreign currency forward contracts ( 0.3 ) — Selling and administrative expenses ( 0.3 ) — Forward starting interest swap 2.0 — Interest and other expenses, net — — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2022 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. 20 In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal on the note due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: Location of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Intercompany CHF note Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 5.1 ) $ — $ ( 7.7 ) $ — Cross-currency swaps Interest and other expenses, net 4.7 — 7.3 — Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was as follows: Location of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 8.4 ) $ 1.4 $ ( 13.2 ) $ ( 5.5 ) The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Assets June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net $ 4.7 $ 24.7 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Accounts Receivable, net 7.3 — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts Receivable, net 0.1 — Total instruments $ 12.1 $ 24.7 21 Liabilities June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2022 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt $ 419.2 $ 454.4 Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 521.2 565.2 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 12.3 24.2 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 0.5 0.2 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 0.8 5.5 Total instruments $ 954.0 $ 1,049.5 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,343.6 and $ 1,064.0 as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,356.0 and $ 1,019.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 115.2 and $ 138.0 as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs).

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery across the company. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 23 Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 903.9 $ 628.8 $ 1,793.3 $ 1,237.6 Other Americas 358.8 415.5 720.6 809.6 1,262.7 1,044.3 2,513.9 2,047.2 Southern Europe: France 1,238.2 1,346.8 2,430.6 2,535.7 Italy 454.3 469.1 899.3 871.9 Other Southern Europe 508.9 606.5 1,065.4 1,175.1 2,201.4 2,422.4 4,395.3 4,582.7 Northern Europe 1,027.1 1,190.5 2,121.6 2,324.3 APME 603.7 619.9 1,221.9 1,247.3 5,094.9 5,277.1 10,252.7 10,201.5 Intercompany Eliminations ( 20.8 ) — ( 35.3 ) — Consolidated (b) $ 5,074.1 $ 5,277.1 $ 10,217.4 $ 10,201.5 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 64.7 $ 38.0 $ 123.0 $ 67.2 Other Americas 16.2 18.0 30.7 32.9 80.9 56.0 153.7 100.1 Southern Europe: France 62.3 65.7 111.9 108.3 Italy 35.5 31.7 64.5 51.1 Other Southern Europe 13.9 17.9 30.5 29.3 111.7 115.3 206.9 188.7 Northern Europe 10.8 17.9 14.1 22.7 APME 22.5 22.3 41.5 41.1 225.9 211.5 416.2 352.6 Corporate expenses ( 35.8 ) ( 37.3 ) ( 77.8 ) ( 74.5 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 9.4 ) ( 4.3 ) ( 19.0 ) ( 9.8 ) Operating profit 180.7 169.9 319.4 268.3 Interest and other expenses, net ( 6.7 ) ( 2.8 ) ( 9.4 ) ( 8.2 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 174.0 $ 167.1 $ 310.0 $ 260.1 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.1 and $ 3.0 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 6.0 and $ 6.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 128.1 and $ 114.6 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 238.9 and $ 232.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, as we experienced in the second quarter of 2022, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. During the second quarter of 2022, the significant strengthening of the dollar, particularly against the Euro, had a 9.5% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.25 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the second quarter of 2022, we experienced a 20.9% revenue increase in the Americas, primarily driven by our acquisition of the ettain group in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021, which now operates as part of our Experis brand, and increased demand for our staffing/interim services. We refer to the ettain group acquisition as the ""Experis acquisition."" During the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, revenues decreased -9.1% in Southern Europe, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates. In the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, we experienced a -13.7% revenue decrease in Northern Europe, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates. We experienced a -2.6% revenue decrease in APME in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by the increase in our Manpower staffing/interim and Experis business. 25 From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue decreases in Manpower, and revenue increases in Experis and Talent Solutions during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. The revenue decrease in our Manpower brand was due to unfavorable currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Manpower brand experienced improved demand for staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the Experis acquisition in the United States, improved demand for our interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our RPO and MSP services. Our gross profit margin improved in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix and growth in higher margin offerings. This was primarily driven by an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 34.4% (45.0% in constant currency and 43.2% in organic constant currency) during the quarter as a result of stronger permanent hiring activity during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021.The increase in gross profit margin was also due to the improvement in our Manpower staffing margins and a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin consulting and MSP services, including from the Experis acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues in our higher-margin Right Management career transition business. We also incurred Experis acquisition integration costs of $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 relating to our Experis acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our operating profit increased 6.3% in the second quarter of 2022 while our operating profit margin increased 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021. Excluding Experis acquisition integration costs of $2.7 incurred in the second quarter of 2022, our operating profit increased 7.9% while operating profit margin increased 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021. The operating profit margin increased due to the improvement in our gross profit margin. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 26 Operating Results - Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to 2021. (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 5,074.1 $ 5,277.1 (3.8 )% 5.7 % Cost of services 4,152.9 4,417.0 (6.0 )% 3.6 % Gross profit 921.2 860.1 7.1 % 16.4 % Gross profit margin 18.2 % 16.3 % Selling and administrative expenses 740.5 690.2 7.3 % 16.0 % Operating profit 180.7 169.9 6.3 % 18.1 % Operating profit margin 3.6 % 3.2 % Interest and other expenses, net 6.7 2.8 135.3 % Earnings before income taxes 174.0 167.1 4.1 % 15.5 % Provision for income taxes 51.8 55.5 (6.7 )% Effective income tax rate 29.8 % 33.2 % Net earnings $ 122.2 $ 111.6 9.5 % 21.5 % Net earnings per share – diluted $ 2.29 $ 2.02 13.4 % 25.7 % Weighted average shares – diluted 53.4 55.4 (3.6 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -3.8% (increase of 5.7% in constant currency and 2.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 27 The year-over-year 190 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 7.3% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2022 (16.0% in constant currency; 11.8% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 150 basis points in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to: Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to increased foreign exchange loss and increased interest expense. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 29.8% in the second quarter of 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 33.2% for the second quarter of 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25% and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 29.8% effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. 28 Net earnings per share - diluted was $2.29 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $2.02 in the second quarter of 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2022. The Experis acquisition integration costs in the second quarter of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.04, net of tax. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 53.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 from 55.4 million in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards. Operating Results - Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to 2021. (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 10,217.4 $ 10,201.5 0.2 % 7.7 % Cost of services 8,399.1 8,573.3 (2.0 )% 5.5 % Gross profit 1,818.3 1,628.2 11.7 % 19.2 % Gross profit margin 17.8 % 16.0 % Selling and administrative expenses 1,498.9 1,359.9 10.2 % 17.1 % Operating profit 319.4 268.3 19.0 % 29.6 % Operating profit margin 3.1 % 2.6 % Interest and other expenses, net 9.4 8.2 13.6 % Earnings before income taxes 310.0 260.1 19.2 % 29.5 % Provision for income taxes 96.2 86.5 11.2 % Effective income tax rate 31.0 % 33.3 % Net earnings $ 213.8 $ 173.6 23.2 % 33.9 % Net earnings per share – diluted $ 3.97 $ 3.13 26.8 % 38.0 % Weighted average shares – diluted 53.8 55.5 (3.0 )% The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 0.2% (7.7% in constant currency and 4.4% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 29 The year-over-year 180 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 10.2% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the first half of 2022 (17.1% in constant currency; 12.7% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 140 basis points in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021 due primarily to: 30 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $9.4 million in the first half of 2022 compared to $8.2 million in the first half of 2021. Miscellaneous income increased to $11.1 million in the first half of 2022 from $8.6 million in the first half of 2021 primarily due to a translation gain from the sale of a subsidiary and increase in the returns on pension plan assets. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 31.0% for the first half of 2022 as compared to an effective rate of 33.3% for the first half of 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25% and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 31.0% effective tax rate in the first half of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $3.97 in the first half of 2022 compared to $3.13 in the first half of 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.35 per share in the first half of 2022. The net loss from the disposition of our Russia business in the first half of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.15 in the first half of 2022. The Experis acquisition integration costs in the first half of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 53.8 million in the first half of 2022 from 55.5 million in the first half of 2021. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first half of 2021, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards. 31 Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 20.9% (22.7% in constant currency and 3.8% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. In the United States (which represents 72% of the America's revenues), revenues from services increased 43.7% (12.3% on an organic basis) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis staffing/interim services including the significant contribution to revenues from our Experis acquisition and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 81.7% (70.5% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased -13.6% (-9.0% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 64.9% (69.5% in constant currency). This decline was driven by a decrease in Mexico of -60.9% (-60.8% in constant currency) due to labor legislation implemented in the third quarter of 2021 that prohibits the provision of traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for specialized services outside of the client's core business. Although we believe the new labor legislation will continue to result in significant comparative year-over-year revenue reductions in Mexico through the third quarter, we believe the shift will improve the margins of our Mexico business over time. Our Mexico operations generated approximately 1.9% of our consolidated global revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decline was partially offset by increases in Canada, Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Chile of 0.4%, 14.0%, 19.7%, 5.6% and 14.5%, respectively (4.3%, 20.8%, 50.3%, 4.4% and 34.8%, respectively, in constant currency). In the Americas, revenues from services increased 22.8% (24.2% in constant currency and 5.3% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. In the United States revenues from services increased 44.9% (13.7% on an organic basis) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis staffing/interim services including the significant contribution to revenues from our Experis acquisition and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 85.9% (72.9% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased -11.0% (-7.5% in constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021 primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 73.1% (78.3% in constant currency). This decline was driven by a decrease in Mexico of -61.2% (-61.1% in constant currency) due to the labor legislation described above. The decline was partially offset by increases in Canada, Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Chile of 11.1%, 17.1%, 17.1%, 8.3% and 27.6%, respectively (13.2%, 26.3%, 34.9%, 9.8% and 46.2%, respectively, in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in both the second quarter and first half of 2022 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2021 primarily due to increases in our permanent recruitment business, improvements in the staffing/interim margins, the Experis acquisition and increases in revenues from our higher-margin MSP and RPO offerings in the United States. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable changes in business mix as the higher-margin Right Management career transition business represented a lower percentage of the revenue mix. In the second quarter of 2022 and first half of 2022, selling and administrative expenses increased 35.7% (36.7% in constant currency and 21.9% in organic constant currency) and 35.7% (36.4% in constant currency and 21.1% in organic constant currency), respectively, primarily due to the Experis acquisition, an increase in salary-related costs as a result of a higher headcount as we invested in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity. The increase in salary-related costs was also due to an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. The increase was also due to Experis acquisition integration costs of $2.7 million and $6.4 million incurred in the second quarter of 2022 and first half of 2022, respectively, and an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology initiatives. 32 Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 6.4% and 5.4% for the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 7.2% in the second quarter of 2022 from 6.0% in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to increases in our permanent recruitment business including our RPO offering, the Experis acquisition, increased operating leverage and an increase in the gross profit margin partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount and Experis acquisition integration costs incurred in the second quarter of 2022. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.5% in the second quarter of 2022 from 4.3% in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 6.1% and 4.9% for the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 6.9% in the first half of 2022 from 5.4% in the first half of 2021 primarily due to increases in our permanent recruitment business including our RPO offering, the Experis acquisition, increased operating leverage and an increase in the gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount and Experis acquisition integration costs incurred in the first half of 2022. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.3% in the first half of 2022 from 4.1% in the first half of 2021 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -9.1% (increase of 2.2% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, revenues from services decreased -8.1% (increase of 4.1% in constant currency) in France (which represents 56% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased -3.2% (increase of 9.7% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 21% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints negatively impacted the demand for our services from our automotive, construction and logistics clients. The decrease in Italy was primarily due the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and Experis interim services and a 22.1% increase (38.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -16.1% (-7.8% in constant currency) during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis business services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 20.9% (34.9% in constant currency). In Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -4.1% (increase of 5.1% in constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. In the first half of 2022, revenues from services decreased -4.1% (increase of 5.8% in constant currency) in France and increased 3.1% (13.8% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints negatively impacted the demand for our services from our automotive, construction and logistics clients, and a 18.4% increase (30.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and Experis interim services and a 29.6% increase (43.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased -9.3% (-2.7% in constant currency) during the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 28.4% (39.7% in constant currency) and increased demand for our Experis business services. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2022 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2021. The increase was primarily due the increases in our permanent recruitment business and increases in staffing/interim margins. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -5.3% (increase of 6.4% in constant currency) during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, and an increase in higher non-personnel related costs to support the growth in revenues. 33 Selling and administrative expenses decreased -2.2% (increase of 7.1% in constant currency) during the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.1% for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 4.8% for the second quarter of 2021. In France, the OUP margin was 5.0% for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 4.9% for the second quarter of 2021. The increase in France was primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.8% for the second quarter of 2022 from 6.8% for the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin and our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 2.7% in the second quarter of 2022 from 3.0% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, and an increase in higher non-personnel related costs to support the growth in revenues. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.7% for the first half of 2022 compared to 4.1% for the first half of 2021. In France, the OUP margin was 4.6% for the first half of 2022 compared to 4.3% for the first half of 2021. The increase in France was primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.2% for the first half of 2022 from 5.9% for the first half of 2021 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 2.9% in the first half of 2022 from 2.5% in the first half of 2021, primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, the largest country operations include the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 36%, 25%, 13%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues). In the region, revenues from services decreased -13.7% (-2.4% in constant currency and an increase of 0.1% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Nordics, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium of -15.4%,- 4.1%, -19.0%, -16.3% and -9.5%, respectively (-5.8%, +10.1%, -8.3%, -5.2%, and +2.4%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by the 29.2% increase (46.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and increased demand for our Experis staffing services. In Northern Europe, revenues from services decreased -8.7% (-0.3% in constant currency and increased 2.0% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium of -9.3%, -14.6%, -12.7% and -4.9% respectively (-3.1%, -5.9%, -3.8% and +4.9% respectively, in constant currency). The decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in the Nordics of 1.6% (12.8% in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis staffing services and the 39.0% increase (52.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2022 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2021 primarily due to increases in our staffing/interim margins, a direct cost adjustment and the increases in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -1.0% (increase of 11.9% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. The decrease is primarily due the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount. Selling and administrative expenses increased 4.4% (14.3% in constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount, the loss on the sale of our Russia business, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues. 34 OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 1.1% in the second quarter of 2022 from 1.5% in the second quarter of 2021. OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 0.7% in the first half of 2022 from 1.0% in the first half of 2021. The decreases were primarily due to the loss on the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by the increase in gross profit margin. APME Revenues from services decreased -2.6% (increase of 9.7% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. In Japan (which represents 45% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -5.2% (increase of 12.4% in constant currency) due to the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 11.7% increase (32.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 12% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased -15.3% (-8.6% in constant currency) due to the exit of a low margin client arrangement in the second quarter of 2021. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is primarily due the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and our Experis business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates. Revenues from services decreased -2.0% (increase of 7.8% in constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. In Japan, revenues from services decreased -1.4% (increase of 12.4% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services. In Australia, revenues from services decreased -24.1% (-18.6% in constant currency) due to the exit of a low margin client arrangement in the back-end of the first half of 2021. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is primarily due the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and our Experis business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2022 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2021 primarily due to the increase in our staffing/interim margins and the increases in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased -0.7% (increase of 11.3% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. The decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increases in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support increases in revenues, increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.4% (11.3% in constant currency) in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021.The increases are primarily due to higher salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support increases in revenues, increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues, partially offset by the favorable impact of the change in currency exchange rates. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.7% in the second quarter of 2022 from 3.6% in the second quarter of 2021 due to the increase in the gross profit margin. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.4% in the first half of 2022 from 3.3% in the first half of 2021 due to the increase in the gross profit margin. 35 Financ ial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared to 2021 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States $ 903.9 43.7 % — 43.7 % 31.4 % 12.3 % Other Americas 358.8 (13.6 )% (4.6 )% (9.0 )% — (9.0 )% 1,262.7 20.9 % (1.8 )% 22.7 % 18.9 % 3.8 % Southern Europe: France 1,238.2 (8.1 )% (12.2 )% 4.1 % — 4.1 % Italy 454.3 (3.2 )% (12.9 )% 9.7 % — 9.7 % Other Southern Europe 508.9 (16.1 )% (8.3 )% (7.8 )% — (7.8 )% 2,201.4 (9.1 )% (11.3 )% 2.2 % — 2.2 % Northern Europe 1,027.1 (13.7 )% (11.3 )% (2.4 )% (2.5 )% 0.1 % APME 603.7 (2.6 )% (12.3 )% 9.7 % — 9.7 % 5,094.9 Intercompany Eliminations (20.8 ) Consolidated $ 5,074.1 (3.8 )% (9.5 )% 5.7 % 3.2 % 2.5 % Gross Profit $ 921.2 7.1 % (9.3 )% 16.4 % 5.0 % 11.4 % Selling and Administrative Expenses $ 740.5 7.3 % (8.7 )% 16.0 % 4.2 % 11.8 % Operating Profit $ 180.7 6.3 % (11.8 )% 18.1 % 8.3 % 9.8 % 36 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared to 2021 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States $ 1,793.3 44.9 % — 44.9 % 31.2 % 13.7 % Other Americas 720.6 (11.0 )% (3.5 )% (7.5 )% — (7.5 )% 2,513.9 22.8 % (1.4 )% 24.2 % 18.9 % 5.3 % Southern Europe: France 2,430.6 (4.1 )% (9.9 )% 5.8 % — 5.8 % Italy 899.3 3.1 % (10.7 )% 13.8 % — 13.8 % Other Southern Europe 1,065.4 (9.3 )% (6.6 )% (2.7 )% — (2.7 )% 4,395.3 (4.1 )% (9.2 )% 5.1 % — 5.1 % Northern Europe 2,121.6 (8.7 )% (8.4 )% (0.3 )% (2.3 )% 2.0 % APME 1,221.9 (2.0 )% (9.8 )% 7.8 % — 7.8 % 10,252.7 Intercompany Eliminations (35.3 ) Consolidated $ 10,217.4 0.2 % (7.5 )% 7.7 % 3.3 % 4.4 % Gross Profit $ 1,818.3 11.7 % (7.5 )% 19.2 % 5.4 % 13.8 % Selling and Administrative Expenses $ 1,498.9 10.2 % (6.9 )% 17.1 % 4.4 % 12.7 % Operating Profit $ 319.4 19.0 % (10.6 )% 29.6 % 10.0 % 19.6 % 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of June 30, 2022, we had $481.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $21.3 million and $195.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $273.5 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $25.4 million utilized during the six months ended June 30, 2021. These changes were primarily attributable to the strong revenue growth and decrease in accounts payable due to timing. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,343.9 million as of June 30, 2022 from $5,448.2 million as of December 31, 2021 due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by three days to 58 days as of June 30, 2022 from December 31, 2021 due to higher activity levels and to unfavorable payment term mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, as we experienced during the six months ended June 30, 2022, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $41.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $24.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2022 compared to 2021 are primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $1.4 million and $13.3 million, respectively. The 2022 payment represents a contingent consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. The 2021 payments represent consideration payments for franchises in the United States as well as contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $3.2 million and simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new owner of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $8.0 million. Net debt proceeds were $384.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $1.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The net proceeds in 2022 include a $25.0 million repayment into our revolving debt facility, against which we had outstanding borrowings of $75.0 million as of December 31, 2021 related to the Experis acquisition. We intend to repay the remaining $50.0 million in the third quarter of 2022. 38 On June 30, 2022, we offered and sold €400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.50% notes due June 30, 2027 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the Notes were used in July 2022 to repay our €400.0 million 1.875% notes due September 11, 2022. The Notes were issued at a price of 99.465% to yield an effective interest rate of 3.514%, net of a favorable impact of a forward starting interest rate swap. Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on June 30 of each year. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and other liabilities. Our €500.0 million notes are due June 2026. When the €500.0 million notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets upon replacement of the €500.0 million notes. On May 27, 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of commercial banks with a termination date of May 27, 2027 to replace our previous $600.0 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and includes terms generally consistent with our previous credit facility, except the Credit Agreement uses Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the base rate index instead of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Under the Credit Agreement, a credit ratings-based pricing grid determines the facility fee and the credit spread that we add to the applicable interbank borrowing rate on all borrowings. At our current credit rating, the annual facility fee is 10 basis points paid on the entire facility and the credit spread is 102.5 basis points on any borrowings. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants pertaining to our management and operations, including limitations on the amount of subsidiary debt that we may incur and limitations on our ability to pledge assets, as well as financial covenants requiring, among other things, that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy or involuntary proceedings, certain monetary and non-monetary judgements, change of control and customary ERISA defaults. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.22 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.74 to 1 as of June 30, 2022. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2022, we had $50.0 million borrowings and letters of credit of $0.4 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $549.6 million were available to us under the facility as of June 30, 2022. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of June 30, 2022, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $318.2 million, of which $301.0 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $282.8 million could have been made under these lines as of June 30, 2022. We have assessed our liquidity position as of June 30, 2022 and for the near future. As of June 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $886.2 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, of which just $50.0 million was used as of June 30, 2022, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $282.8 million was available to use as of June 30, 2022. Our €500.0 ($521.2) million notes mature in June 2026, and our €400.0 ($419.2) million notes with a maturity date September 2022 were refinanced with the Notes ($415.6 million) with a maturity of June 30, 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. 39 The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.36 and $1.26 per share, respectively, on May 6, 2022 and May 7, 2021, respectively. The 2022 dividends were paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022. The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021. In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2022, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares comprised of 1.2 million shares under the 2019 authorization and 0.5 million shares under the 2021 authorization, at a total cost of $160.0 million. During the first six months of 2021, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $150.1 million. As of June 30, 2022, there were 3.5 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,419.3 million as of June 30, 2022 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,156.7 million as of December 31, 2021. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $805.1 million and $769.3 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively ($757.5 million and $717.7 million for guarantees, respectively, and $47.6 million and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.9 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. We did not record any restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2022 or 2021. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we made payments of $6.8 million out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories.

Item 4 – Control s and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding timely disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation discussed above that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 41 PART II - OTH ER INFORMATION Ite m 1A – Risk Factors As of the date of this filing, the Company and its operations continue to be subject to the risk factors previously disclosed in the “Risk Factors” sections contained in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 121.6 Provisions charged to earnings 2.8 Write-offs ( 1.4 ) Translation adjustments ( 2.2 ) Balance, March 31, 2022 $ 120.8 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 8 Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.5 %. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2021 included a discount rate of 10.4 %, revenue growth for the next three years ranging from 3.0 % - 5.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. If the Netherlands reporting unit cannot improve from its current operating levels and meet its operating targets to achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 109.2 as of March 31, 2022, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2022 In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures by business entities about government assistance. The guidance requires business entities to disclose, in notes to their financial statements, information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2022 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022 . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations. The guidance added the contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2023 . We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 9 (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to March 31, 2022, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 33.5 as of March 31, 2022 and $ 34.8 as of December 31, 2021. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 0.3 and $ 1.7 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual grant of share-based compensation generally takes place during the first quarter of each fiscal year. The number of shares granted to employees and members of our Board of Directors, and the weighted-average fair value per share for shares granted during the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 are presented in the table below: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Fair Value Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Fair Value Stock Options — N/A 130 $ 22.83 Deferred Stock Units 13 97.33 12 90.18 Restricted Stock Units 245 104.50 197 85.66 Performance Share Units 134 106.40 203 84.34 Total Shares Granted 392 $ 104.91 542 $ 70.19 (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2022. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 12.9 , which represents consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideratio n payments related to previous acquisitions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $ 3.2 and simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new owner of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $ 8.0 . 11 On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our strategy of diversifying our business mix into higher growth and higher value services. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 930.9 . Of the total consideration paid, $ 925.0 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 5.9 was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $ 150.0 draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. We expect to finalize the net working capital adjustments in the second half of 2022. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2021: Cash and cash equivalents $ 14.6 Accounts receivable 132.2 Prepaid expenses and other assets 6.3 Operating lease right-of-use asset 8.7 Goodwill 519.6 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 360.0 Accounts payable ( 40.5 ) Employee compensation payable ( 15.0 ) Accrued liabilities ( 7.9 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 11.2 ) Value added taxes payable ( 12.2 ) Long-term operating lease liability ( 5.9 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 17.8 ) Total assets and liabilities $ 930.9 The customer relationship intangible asset will be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The customer relationship intangible asset and goodwill from the acquisition are partially deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 the carrying value of intangible assets were $ 354.0 and $ 348.0 , respectively, and the carrying value of goodwill was $ 519.6 . The goodwill is included within the United States reporting unit and is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and expected synergies to occur post-acquisition as a result of diversifying the business into higher growth and higher value services. We expect to finalize our accounting for the acquisition in the second half of 2022, upon finalization of the accounting for income tax related items and working capital adjustments. (6) Restructuring Costs We did not record any restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we made payments o f $ 3.2 out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severance and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remainin g $ 20.1 r eserve will be paid by the end of 2022. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 21.5 $ — $ — $ 23.3 Costs paid or utilized ( 0.3 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 2.5 ) — — ( 3.2 ) Balance, March 31, 2022 $ 0.7 $ 0.4 $ 19.0 $ — $ — $ 20.1 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.2 and zero as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.6 and $ 0.2 as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 . Balances related to Italy were $ 0.3 and $ 0.2 as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 , respectively. 12 (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.6 % for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 33.3 % for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25 % and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 32.6% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of March 31, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 73.4 . If recognized, the entire amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate except for $ 6.0 . As of December 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 71.8 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2015 through 2022 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of March 31, 2022, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Spain and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 91.6 $ 62.0 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 53.6 55.1 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.7 0.5 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 54.4 55.7 Net earnings per share - basic $ 1.71 $ 1.12 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 1.68 $ 1.11 There were 0.2 million and no share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 13 (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,710.0 $ — $ 1,710.0 $ 1,722.2 $ — $ 1,722.2 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 820.0 $ 427.8 $ 392.2 $ 823.4 $ 421.6 $ 401.8 Other 23.0 20.2 2.8 23.2 19.7 3.5 843.0 448.0 395.0 846.6 441.3 405.3 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 126.0 — 126.0 126.3 — 126.3 178.0 — 178.0 178.3 — 178.3 Total intangible assets $ 1,021.0 $ 448.0 $ 573.0 $ 1,024.9 $ 441.3 $ 583.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as o f both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2022 is expected to be $ 27.9 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2023 - $ 33.9 , 2024 - $ 31.9 , 2025 - $ 29.9 , 2026 - $ 26.2 and 2027 - $ 25.5 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 1,058.9 $ 146.7 $ 313.7 $ 76.9 $ 126.0 $ 1,722.2 Currency impact 0.8 ( 3.3 ) ( 8.3 ) ( 1.4 ) — ( 12.2 ) Balance, March 31, 2022 $ 1,059.7 $ 143.4 $ 305.4 $ 75.5 $ 126.0 $ 1,710.0 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 1,013.0 a s of both December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 68.2 and $ 66.4 as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 3.9 and $ 3.8 as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 , respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. Right Management is allocated to the reporting units of the countries in which Right Management operates. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balances to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2022 2021 United States $ 1,091.7 $ 1,091.7 Netherlands 109.2 112.2 United Kingdom 107.8 110.7 France 72.5 74.3 Sweden 40.0 41.4 Other reporting units 288.8 291.9 Total goodwill $ 1,710.0 $ 1,722.2 14 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Defined Benefit Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost $ 5.1 $ 5.6 $ — $ — Interest cost 2.3 1.5 0.1 0.1 Expected return on assets ( 3.9 ) ( 3.1 ) — — Net loss 0.5 1.2 — — Prior service cost (credit) 0.2 0.2 ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) Total benefit cost (credit) $ 4.2 $ 5.4 $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) During the three months ended March 31, 2022 , contributions made to our pension plans and retiree health care plan were $ 2.1 and $ 0.3 , respectively. During 2022, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 15.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency translation $ ( 216.7 ) $ ( 180.8 ) Translation loss on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 9.8 ) and $( 16.4 ), respectively 4.5 ( 18.4 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 131.1 ) ( 133.6 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 22.7 ) and $( 22.8 ), respectively ( 56.2 ) ( 56.7 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.6 on both dates ( 0.1 ) 0.1 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 399.6 ) $ ( 389.4 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 0.5 and income of $ 0.9 in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 15 Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.36 and $ 1.26 per share on May 6, 2022 and May 7 , 2021 , respectively. The 2022 dividends are payable on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022 . The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021 . Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 0.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 59.9 . During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 1.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 100.1 . As of March 31, 2022, there were 4.0 million and 0.6 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively. (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Interest expense $ 10.4 $ 10.2 Interest income ( 2.8 ) ( 3.1 ) Foreign exchange loss 1.8 2.5 Miscellaneous income, net ( 6.7 ) ( 4.2 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 2.7 $ 5.4 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 442.5 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 550.2 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of March 31, 2022. 16 In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: Gain Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2022 2021 Euro Notes $ 27.3 $ 43.7 Cross-currency swaps 2.9 20.5 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap had an original maturity of April 2022, which aligned to the term of the intercompany note. On March 17, 2022, we settled the swap ahead of its maturity date, resulting in a net cash inflow of $ 19.2 . We simultaneously entered into new cross currency swaps, which we account for as fair value hedges, with maturity dates of April 2024. Refer to the ""Fair Value Hedge"" section below for additional detail. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which aligns to term of the intercompany note. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. In September 2021, we entered into a series of forward currency exchange contracts denominated in GBP. The economic effect of the forward is to eliminate the uncertainty in cash flows in GBP associated with a portion of our forecasted IT contract spend in 2022 by fixing the amount at £ 6.0 . Gains and losses from the hedge offset the foreign currency exchange impact of the contracts. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. 17 The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: Loss Recognized in OCI Gain Reclassified from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended March 31, Location of Gain Reclassified Three Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2022 2021 from AOCI into Income 2022 2021 Cross-currency swaps $ ( 1.0 ) $ ( 5.3 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ 0.9 $ 5.2 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at March 31, 2022 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use fair value hedges to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency intercompany denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. Gains and losses on the fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item. In March 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to hedge our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against our Euro functional subsidiary entity. The cross-currency swap matures in April 2024, which aligns the term of the intercompany note and has a fixed interest rate of 1.05973 %. The cross-currency swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal on the note because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The following tables present the impact that the fair value hedges had on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: Location of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Intercompany CHF note Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 2.6 ) $ — Cross-currency swaps Interest and other expenses, net 2.6 — Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was as follows: Location of Loss Amount of Loss Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 4.8 ) $ ( 6.9 ) 18 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Assets March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 3.7 $ 24.7 Instruments designated as fair value hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets 2.5 — Total instruments $ 6.2 $ 24.7 Liabilities March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes due in 2022 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt $ 442.5 $ 454.4 Euro Notes due in 2026 Long-term debt 550.2 565.2 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 22.6 24.2 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 10.2 5.5 Total instruments $ 1,025.5 $ 1,049.3 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,009.4 and $ 1,064.0 as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 992.7 and $ 1,019.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 132.2 and $ 138.0 as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). 19 (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Operating lease expense $ 32.9 $ 35.5 Short-term lease expense 1.2 1.5 Other lease expense (1) $ 4.7 $ 4.9 Total lease expense $ 38.8 $ 41.9 Other information related to leases was as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 33.3 $ 34.7 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 9.5 11.0 March 31, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2022 2021 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 351.5 $ 373.4 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 106.0 $ 110.0 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 256.3 275.8 Total operating lease liabilities $ 362.3 $ 385.8 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery across the company. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 21 Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 889.4 $ 608.8 Other Americas 361.8 394.1 1,251.2 1,002.9 Southern Europe: France 1,192.4 1,188.9 Italy 445.0 402.8 Other Southern Europe 556.5 568.6 2,193.9 2,160.3 Northern Europe 1,094.5 1,133.8 APME 618.2 627.4 5,157.8 4,924.4 Intercompany Eliminations ( 14.5 ) — Consolidated (b) $ 5,143.3 $ 4,924.4 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 58.3 $ 29.2 Other Americas 14.5 14.9 72.8 44.1 Southern Europe: France 49.6 42.6 Italy 29.0 19.4 Other Southern Europe 16.6 11.4 95.2 73.4 Northern Europe 3.3 4.8 APME 19.0 18.8 190.3 141.1 Corporate expenses ( 42.0 ) ( 37.2 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 9.6 ) ( 5.5 ) Operating profit 138.7 98.4 Interest and other expenses, net ( 2.7 ) ( 5.4 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 136.0 $ 93.0 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 2.9 and $ 3.1 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 110.8 and $ 117.5 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 3.6 for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 265.2 and $ 249.1 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 22 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 31 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency.

Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, as we experienced in the first quarter of 2022, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. During the first quarter of 2022, changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 5.4% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.10 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the first quarter of 2022, we experienced a 24.8% revenue increase in the Americas, primarily driven by our acquisition of the ettain group in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021, which now operates as part of our Experis brand, and increased demand for our staffing/interim services. We refer to the ettain group acquisition as the ""Experis acquisition."" During the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, revenues increased 1.6% in Southern Europe due to increased demand in Italy, Switzerland and Israel. In the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a 3.5% revenue decrease in Northern Europe, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates. We experienced a 1.5% revenue decrease in APME in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by the increase in our Manpower staffing/interim and Experis business. 23 From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue decreases in Manpower, and revenue increases in Experis and Talent Solutions during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue decrease in our Manpower brand was due to unfavorable currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Manpower brand experienced improved demand for staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the Experis acquisition in the United States, improved demand for our interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our RPO and MSP services. Our gross profit margin improved in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix and growth in higher margin offerings. This is primarily driven by an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 48.3% (54.8% in constant currency and 51.8% in organic constant currency) during the quarter as a result of stronger hiring activity during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021.The increase in gross profit margin was also due to the improvement in our Manpower staffing margins and a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin consulting and MSP services. These increases were partially offset by a lower mix of revenues coming from our higher-margin Right Management career transition business. We recorded a net loss on the sale of our Russia business of $8.0 million, which was comprised of a $9.7 million loss in selling and administrative expenses, offset by a $1.7 million gain in interest and other expenses. We also incurred acquisition integration costs of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 relating to our Experis acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our operating profit increased 40.9% in the first quarter of 2022 while our operating profit margin increased 70 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the loss of $9.7 million in selling and administrative expenses from the disposition of our Russia business and acquisition integration costs of $3.7 incurred in the first quarter of 2022, our operating profit was up 54.6% while operating profit margin was up 100 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. The operating profit margin increased due to the improvement in our gross profit margin. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 24 Operating Results - Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 5,143.3 $ 4,924.4 4.4 % 9.8 % Cost of services 4,246.2 4,156.3 2.2 % 7.6 % Gross profit 897.1 768.1 16.8 % 22.2 % Gross profit margin 17.4 % 15.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 758.4 669.7 13.2 % 18.2 % Operating profit 138.7 98.4 40.9 % 49.3 % Operating profit margin 2.7 % 2.0 % Interest and other expenses, net 2.7 5.4 (50.8 )% Earnings before income taxes 136.0 93.0 46.3 % 54.7 % Provision for income taxes 44.4 31.0 43.2 % Effective income tax rate 32.6 % 33.3 % Net earnings $ 91.6 $ 62.0 47.8 % 56.3 % Net earnings per share – diluted $ 1.68 $ 1.11 51.4 % 60.4 % Weighted average shares – diluted 54.4 55.7 (2.3 )% The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 4.4% (9.8% in constant currency and 6.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 25 The year-over-year 180 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 13.2% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2022 (18.2% in constant currency; 13.6% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 110 basis points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to: 26 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. Miscellaneous income increased to $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 from $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to a translation gain from the sale of a subsidiary and increase in the returns on pension plan assets. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to an effective rate of 33.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The 2022 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25% and a higher level of pre-tax earnings with a more beneficial mix diluting the impact of the French business tax. The 32.6% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2022 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $1.68 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $1.11 in the first quarter of 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2022. The net loss from the disposition of our Russia business in the first quarter of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.15 in the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition integration costs in the first quarter of 2022 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.05, net of tax. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 54.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 from 55.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards. 27 Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 24.8% (25.7% in constant currency and 6.9% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. In the United States (which represents 71% of the America's revenues), revenues from services increased 46.1% (15.2% on an organic basis) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the Experis acquisition in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021, increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 89.4% (78.0% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 8.2% (-5.9% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, partially offset by the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 83.6% (89.5% in constant currency). This decline was driven by a decrease in Mexico of 61.6% (61.3% in constant currency) due to labor legislation implemented in the third quarter of 2021 that prohibits the provision of traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for specialized services outside of the client's core business. Although we believe the new labor legislation will continue to result in significant comparative revenue reductions in Mexico over the next two quarters, we believe the shift will improve the margins of our Mexico business over time. Our Mexico operations generated approximately 1.9% of our consolidated global revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decline was partially offset by increases in Canada, Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Chile of 23.4%, 20.4%, 14.2%, 11.1% and 42.6%, respectively (23.5%, 32.3%, 18.0%, 15.5% and 59.2%, respectively, in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter 2022 compared to the first quarter 2021 primarily due to the Experis acquisition, improvements in the staffing/interim margins, increases in our permanent recruitment business and increases in revenues from our higher-margin MSP and RPO offerings in the United States. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable changes in business mix as the higher-margin Right Management career transition business represented a lower percentage of the revenue mix. In the first quarter of 2022, selling and administrative expenses increased 35.6% (36.2% in constant currency and 20.3% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the Experis acquisition, an increase in salary-related costs as a result of a higher headcount as we invested in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity. The increase in salary-related costs was also due to an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. The increase was also due to acquisition integration costs of $3.7 million incurred in the first quarter of 2022 and an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology initiatives. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 5.8% and 4.4% for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 6.6% in the first quarter of 2022 from 4.8% in the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to the Experis acquisition, increased operating leverage, an increase in the gross profit margin and an increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount, partially offset by the acquisition integration costs incurred in the first quarter of 2022. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.0% in the first quarter of 2022 from 3.8% in the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement. 28 Southern Europe In Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 1.6% (8.4% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, revenues from services increased 0.3% (7.7% in constant currency) in France (which represents 54% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and increased 10.5% (18.6% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 20% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints impacted the demand for our services from our automotive clients, a 29.7% increase (39.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and Experis interim services and a 38.7% increase (49.0% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 2.1% (2.7% increase in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 37.2% (45.3% in constant currency). Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the increase in our staffing/interim margins in several markets and the increase of 34.8% (44.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.0% (7.8% in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets. The increase is also due to the higher non-personnel related costs to support the growth in revenues and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.3% for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 3.4% for the first quarter of 2021. In France, the OUP margin was 4.2% for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 3.6% for the first quarter of 2021. The increase in France was primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 6.5% for the first quarter of 2022 from 4.8% for the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2022 from 2.0% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, the largest country operations include the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 38%, 23%, 13%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 3.5% (2.0% increase in constant currency and 3.8% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. We experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands of 3.1%, 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively (-0.3%, -3.5% and -2.4%, respectively, in constant currency). The decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in the Nordics and Belgium of 8.0% and 0.1%, respectively (15.9% and 7.5%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by increased demand for our Experis staffing services and the 50.9% increase (59.8% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to increases in our staffing/interim margins, a direct cost adjustment and the increases in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 10.0% (16.8% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount, the loss on the sale of our Russia business, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increase in revenues. 29 OUP margin for Northern Europe decreased to 0.3% in the first quarter of 2022 from 0.4% in the first quarter of 2021.The decrease was primarily due to the loss on the sale of our Russia business, partially offset by the increase in gross profit margin. APME Revenues from services decreased 1.5% (6.0% increase in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. In Japan (which represents 47% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 2.5% (12.5% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 26.0% increase (38.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. In Australia (which represents 12% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 31.7% (27.1% in constant currency) due to the exit of a low margin client arrangement in the second quarter of 2021. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is primarily due the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and a 10.2% increase (17.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of change in currency exchange rates and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter 2022 compared to the first quarter 2021 primarily due to the increase in our staffing/interim margins and the increase of 10.2% (17.9% in constant currency, respectively) in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 3.6% (11.3% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues and increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increase in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 from 3.0% in the first quarter of 2021 due to the increase in the gross profit margin. 30 Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of March 31, 2022, we ha d $703.0 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $70.6 million and $140.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $66.1 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $58.9 million generated during the three months ended March 31, 2021. These changes were primarily attributable to the decrease in accounts payable due to timing. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,440.0 million as of March 31, 2022 from $5,448.2 million as of December 31, 2021 due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by two day s to 57 days a s of March 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 due to higher activity levels and to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, as we experienced during the three months ended March 31, 2022, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $19.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $12.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2022 compared to 2021 are primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2022. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $12.9 million, which represents consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On January 17, 2022, we disposed of our Russia business in our Northern Europe segment for cash proceeds of $3.2 million and simultaneously entered into a franchise agreement with the new owner of the Russia business. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of $8.0 million. 32 Net debt payments were $28.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to net debt borrowings of $2.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The 2022 payments include a $25.0 million repayment into our revolving debt facility, against which we had outstanding borrowings of $75.0 million as of December 31, 2021 related to the Experis acquisition. We intend to repay the remaining $50.0 million over the next six months. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. We plan to refinance the €400.0 million notes. When the €500.0 million notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets upon replacement of either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of March 31, 2022, we had $50.0 million borrowings and letters of credit of $0.4 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $549.6 million were available to us under the facility as of March 31, 2022. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.92 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.56 to 1 as of March 31, 2022. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financi al institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of March 31, 2022, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $340.9 million, of which $319.7 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $278.8 million could have been made under these lines as of March 31, 2022. We have assessed our liquidity position as of March 31, 2022 and for the near future. As of March 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $777.3 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, of which just $50.0 million was used as of March 31, 2022, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $278.8 million was available to use as of March 31, 2022. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $992.7 millio n as of March 31, 2022 mature in June 2026 and September 2022, and we plan to refinance the €400.0 million note in 2022. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.36 and $1.26 per share, respectively, on May 6, 2022 and May 7, 2021, respectively. The 2022 dividends are payable on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2022. The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021. In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased a total of 0.6 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $59.9 million. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $100.1 million. As of March 31, 2022, there were 4.0 million and 0.6 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively. We had aggregate commitmen ts of $2,061.7 million as of March 31, 2022 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,156.7 million as of December 31, 2021. 33 We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit tota ling $766.4 mill ion and $769.3 million as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively ($718.8 million and $717.7 million for guarantees, respectively, and $47.6 million and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We did not record any restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we made payments o f $3.2 million out of our restructuring reserve, which is used for severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. We expect a majority of the remainin g $20.1 million r eserve will be paid by the end of 2022. 34 Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consoli dated Financial Statements. Item 3 – Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain disclosures about market risks affecting us. There have been no material changes to the information provided which would require additional disclosures as of the date of this filing. Item 4 – Control s and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding timely disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation discussed above that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 35 PART II - OTH ER INFORMATION Ite m 1A – Risk Factors As of the date of this filing, the Company and its operations continue to be subject to the risk factors previously disclosed in the “Risk Factors” sections contained in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information updates the fourth paragraph under the heading “Risk Factors— Our results of operations have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There is a risk that economic conditions in European markets may continue to be negatively impacted by events in recent years which, in addition to COVID-19, have included labor unrest, civil protest, heightened trade tensions, and uncertainty around the impacts of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These events have most recently included the Russia-Ukraine war. There is substantial uncertainty about the future impact of this war on the European economy and the global economy generally. Numerous countries have instituted sanctions and other penalties against Russia. The measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by the U.S., European Union, and others could result in retaliatory action by the Russian government, leading to an escalation and/or expansion in the scope of this conflict. The consequences of this are difficult to predict but may result in further sanctions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, heightened cybersecurity threats, further disruptions in the global supply chain, volatility in foreign exchange rates and inflationary pressures. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, particularly our European operations. In addition, the continuation or extent to which the Russia-Ukraine war may intensify or expand could exacerbate or heighten many of the other risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of the 2021 Form 10-K and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Item 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. We conduct share repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. The following table shows the total number of shares repurchased during the first quarter of 2022. As of March 31, 2022, there were 4.0 million and 0.6 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. The COVID-19 crisis began to negatively impact our business, operations and consolidated financial statements during the last two weeks of March 2020, with significant lockdown measures implemented by the end of March 2020 in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. We continued to experience the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in the third quarter of 2021, particularly related to the impact on supply chains and labor shortages as we believe certain parts of the workforce did not return to the labor market in many industries and markets over concerns about the COVID-19 Delta variant. Although many markets strengthened throughout the first nine months of 2021, the COVID-19 crisis had an adverse effect of curtailing economic activity in certain markets, affecting demand for our services. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We continue to monitor and assess the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 128.1 Provisions charged to earnings 13.7 Write-offs ( 11.7 ) Translation adjustments ( 6.3 ) Reclassifications and other 0.2 Balance, September 30, 2021 $ 124.0 10 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The table below provides our reporting units’ estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 80% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2021. (in millions) France United States United Kingdom Canada Sweden Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 3,130.8 $ 1,480.2 $ 412.0 $ 203.5 $ 150.1 $ 130.5 Carrying values 1,358.2 912.4 335.4 103.9 85.4 123.7 The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Netherlands reporting unit, which is part of the Northern Europe segment. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.5 %. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2021 included a discount rate of 10.4 %, revenue growth for the next three years ranging from 3.0 % - 5.0 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. If the Netherlands reporting cannot meet its operating targets and/or recover from the deteriorated macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, it may not achieve the growth and margin assumptions noted above and some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 114.2 as of September 30, 2021, could be subject to impairment. 11 While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent Events On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 930.9 . Of the total consideration paid, $ 925.0 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 5.9 was for the excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and a $ 150.0 draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. We expect to finalize the net working capital adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2021. The acquisition of ettain group will be accounted for as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of ettain group will be included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date, and its performance will be included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The major classes of assets and liabilities of ettain group are expected to be cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, current and long-term liabilities, deferred taxes, and goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2021 In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to September 30, 2021, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. 12 We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 30.5 as of September 30, 2021 and $ 34.9 as of December 31, 2020. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 5.3 and $ 7.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. 14 (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 13.3 and $ 1.7 , respectively. The 2021 payments mainly related to franchise acquisitions in the United States and a contingent consideration payment associated with a previous acquisition. The 2020 payment represents a deferred consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and synergies. On September 30, 2020 we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for net proceeds of $ 5.8 , subject to normal post close working capital adjustments and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $ 5.8 , which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 5.3 and $ 98.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we made payments o f $ 32.5 out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remainin g $ 18.9 r eserve will be paid by the end of 2021. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, January 1, 2021 $ 1.9 $ 3.5 $ 40.7 $ — $ — $ 46.1 Severance costs 5.3 — — — — 5.3 Costs paid or utilized ( 4.2 ) ( 2.3 ) ( 26.0 ) — — ( 32.5 ) Balance, September 30, 2021 $ 3.0 $ 1.2 $ 14.7 $ — $ — $ 18.9 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 1.4 and $ 0.4 as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.6 as of both December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021 . Balances related to Italy were $ 1.4 and $ 0.5 as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021 , respectively. 15 (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.9 % for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 81.5 % for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings and a discrete valuation allowance in Germany. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5 %, the enacted 50 % reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 32.9% effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.1 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 407.4 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in Germany, and a discrete valuation allowance in Germany. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5 %, the enacted 50 % reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.1% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of September 30, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 68.0 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 64.5 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2014 through 2021 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of September 30, 2021, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share The calculations of net earnings (loss) per share - basic and net earnings (loss) per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders $ 97.7 $ 10.3 $ 271.3 $ ( 52.4 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 54.3 58.2 54.7 58.4 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.2 — 0.1 — Effect of other share-based awards 0.7 0.3 0.6 — Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 55.2 58.5 55.4 58.4 Net earnings (loss) per share - basic $ 1.80 $ 0.18 $ 4.96 $ ( 0.90 ) Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 1.77 $ 0.18 $ 4.90 $ ( 0.90 ) There were 0.1 million and 0.7 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share - diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. There were 0.2 million and 1.5 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share - diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. Due to the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the assumed exercise of share-based awards had an anti-dilutive effect and therefore were not included in the calculations of net loss per share - diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 16 (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,206.6 $ — $ 1,206.6 $ 1,225.8 $ — $ 1,225.8 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships 465.1 $ 415.5 $ 49.6 $ 473.0 $ 403.8 $ 69.2 Other 22.7 17.8 4.9 21.9 21.6 0.3 487.8 433.3 54.5 494.9 425.4 69.5 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 125.7 — 125.7 127.1 — 127.1 177.7 — 177.7 179.1 — 179.1 Total intangible assets $ 665.5 $ 433.3 $ 232.2 $ 674.0 $ 425.4 $ 248.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as o f both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2021 is expected to be $ 3.4 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2022 - $ 13.1 , 2023 - $ 10.5 , 2024 - $ 8.1 , 2025 - $ 6.0 and 2026 - $ 2.2 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 536.6 $ 154.9 $ 326.6 $ 81.7 $ 126.0 $ 1,225.8 Acquisitions 3.1 — — — — 3.1 Currency impact ( 0.4 ) ( 7.5 ) ( 10.5 ) ( 3.9 ) — ( 22.3 ) Balance, September 30, 2021 $ 539.3 $ 147.4 $ 316.1 $ 77.8 $ 126.0 $ 1,206.6 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 490.2 an d $ 493.3 a s of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 73.3 and $69.5 as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.2 and $ 4.0 as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. Right Management is allocated to the reporting units of the countries in which Right Management operates. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balances to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2021 2020 United States $ 572.1 $ 545.7 Netherlands 114.2 119.3 United Kingdom 110.3 100.2 France 75.6 73.3 Sweden 42.1 43.6 Other reporting units (1) 292.3 343.7 Total goodwill $ 1,206.6 $ 1,225.8 (1) As of July 1, 2021, balances pertaining to Right Management entities were allocated to corresponding reporting units. 17 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost $ 5.5 $ 5.3 $ 16.6 $ 15.5 Interest cost 1.5 2.4 4.6 7.0 Expected return on assets ( 3.1 ) ( 3.4 ) ( 9.2 ) ( 10.0 ) Settlement loss — — — 10.2 Other 1.4 0.9 4.1 2.5 Total benefit cost $ 5.3 $ 5.2 $ 16.1 $ 25.2 Retiree Health Care Plan 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Interest cost $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 Prior service credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 0.5 ) Other — — 0.1 — Total benefit credit $ ( 0.1 ) $ — $ ( 0.3 ) $ ( 0.2 ) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 , contributions made to our pension plans were $ 5.1 and $ 14.5 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.2 and $ 0.8 , respectively. During 2021 , we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Pension Settlement During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 , we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The standard PBGC audit was completed in March 2021, and the remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement are being utilized to fund qualified 401(k) plan contributions in current and future years. 18 (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2021 2020 Foreign currency translation $ ( 172.0 ) $ ( 72.1 ) Translation loss on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 18.8 ) and $( 34.9 ), respectively ( 37.1 ) ( 81.2 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 127.6 ) ( 133.3 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 34.0 ) and $( 38.2 ), respectively ( 108.2 ) ( 111.4 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.7 and $ 1.8 , respectively 0.3 0.7 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 444.6 ) $ ( 397.3 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded an expense of $ 0.1 in both the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and income of $ 1.0 and $ 0.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.26 and $ 1.09 per share, respectively, on May 7, 2021 and May 8, 2020 . The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021 . The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020 . Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 and 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 150.1 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 63.8 . The 2021 repurchases all occurred within the first half of 2021, and the 2020 repurchases all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2021 , there were 4.0 million and 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. 19 (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 9.6 $ 10.8 $ 29.5 $ 32.3 Interest income ( 2.9 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 9.1 ) ( 9.9 ) Foreign exchange loss 1.4 0.6 4.5 4.2 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 3.2 ) ( 2.3 ) ( 11.8 ) 5.7 Interest and other expenses, net $ 4.9 $ 6.0 $ 13.1 $ 32.3 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 462.8 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 575.6 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of September 30, 2021. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2021 2020 2021 2020 Euro Notes $ 24.6 $ ( 43.8 ) $ 57.0 $ ( 45.7 ) Cross-currency swaps 1.6 ( 11.3 ) 14.9 ( 8.9 ) 20 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain operational expenses denominated in foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. In September 2021, we entered into a series of forward currency exchange contracts denominated in GBP. The economic effect of the forward is to eliminate the uncertainty in cash flows in GBP associated with a portion of our forecasted IT contract spend in 2022 by fixing the amount at £ 6.0 . Gains and losses from the hedge offset the foreign currency exchange impact of the contracts. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. 21 The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: (Loss) Gain Reclassified Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended September 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified Three Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2021 2020 from AOCI into Income 2021 2020 Cross-currency swaps $ 4.0 $ ( 3.2 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 3.9 ) $ ( 3.3 ) Foreign currency forward contracts ( 0.2 ) — Selling and administrative expenses — — (Loss) Gain Reclassified Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income Nine Months Ended September 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified Nine Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2021 2020 from AOCI into Income 2021 2020 Cross-currency swaps $ 0.9 $ 1.6 Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 0.7 ) $ 1.4 Foreign currency forward contracts ( 0.2 ) — Selling and administrative expenses — — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at September 30, 2021 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was as follows: Location of (Loss) Gain Amount of (Loss) Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 3.0 ) $ — $ ( 8.5 ) $ 0.3 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: Assets September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 12.5 $ 12.1 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net 0.1 1.0 Total instruments $ 12.6 $ 13.1 22 Liabilities September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,038.4 $ 1,094.5 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 15.9 30.5 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 0.2 — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 2.1 — Total instruments $ 1,056.6 $ 1,125.0 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,090.0 and $ 1,159.1 as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,038.4 and $ 1,094.5 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 130.9 and $ 119.4 as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). 23 (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating lease expense $ 35.1 $ 37.4 $ 105.5 $ 109.0 Short-term lease expense 1.4 1.8 4.5 9.0 Other lease expense (1) $ 4.6 $ 3.9 $ 13.6 $ 12.4 Total lease expense $ 41.1 $ 43.1 $ 123.6 $ 130.4 Other information related to leases was as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 104.7 $ 107.9 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 35.9 56.1 September 30, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2021 2020 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 360.4 $ 400.7 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 108.0 $ 119.3 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 268.5 305.1 Total operating lease liabilities $ 376.5 $ 424.4 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales.

These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 121.3 and $ 116.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 353.4 and $ 315.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 3.9 and $ 3.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 11.0 and $ 9.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 253.3 and $ 236.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 755.9 and $ 447.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 26 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on pages 41-42 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a ""forward-looking statement""). Statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” and other similar expressions. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A – Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2020, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions and the Company’s efforts to respond to such impacts, including the possibility of additional lockdown restrictions; changes in labor and tax legislation in places we do business; failure to implement strategic technology investments; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise. We caution that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, as we experienced in the third quarter of 2021, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. During the third quarter of 2021, we continued to see recovery in the majority of our markets as we began to anniversary the COVID-19 related declines in our results that occurred during the third quarter of 2020. Revenues increased 12.1% during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the year-earlier period. Our third quarter results reflect the continuing of the global economic recovery with strong hiring demand from our clients due to vaccine rollouts in many countries and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in many countries resulting in increased demand for our services in most of our key markets. However, we have experienced some slowing in the rate of recovery, with some markets, particularly in Europe, continuing to experience labor shortage and COVID-19 related challenges. These challenges impacted client demand for our services and included supply chain issues and labor shortages as we believe certain parts of the workforce did not return to the labor market in many industries and markets over concerns about the COVID-19 Delta variant. Although, we experienced strengthening demand across most geographies and industries during the quarter compared to the prior year, uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. 27 In addition to the impact from COVID-19 discussed above, results for the quarter were impacted by currency. During the third quarter of 2021, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in our European markets, which therefore had a favorable impact on our reported results and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 1.1% favorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.01 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the third quarter of 2021, our businesses experienced declines in year-over-year revenue trends from the second quarter reflecting a slowing in the rate of recovery in a number of key markets. Our consolidated revenues increased 12.1% year-over-year in the quarter, a decline from the 41.0% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, most of our markets experienced revenue increases as the global recovery continued and as we anniversaried the revenue declines due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a 12.8% revenue increase in Southern Europe, mainly driven by the increased demand in France and Italy. We experienced a 23.1% revenue increase in Northern Europe primarily due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, mostly in the United Kingdom and the Nordics. Revenues increased 7.4% in the Americas driven primarily by the increase in demand for our staffing/interim services and increased demand for our RPO and MSP offerings in the United States. We experienced a 2.6% revenue increase in APME primarily due to the increase in our Experis business. From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue increases in all of our brands during the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue increase in our Manpower brand was primarily due to improved demand for our staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the improved demand for our interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business and increased demand for our managed services, primarily in Southern Europe. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our RPO and MSP services. As workplaces reopened across our geographies and workers returned in phased approaches, we saw increased client demand for our HR skills within our RPO business due to significant hiring activity. Our MSP business has remained resilient during the pandemic and we experienced growth during the quarter as we assisted more clients to develop customized workforce solutions. 28 Our gross profit margin improved in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix as our higher-margin permanent recruitment business, which experienced a 60.4% increase (58.9% in constant currency and 61.4% in organic constant currency) during the quarter as a result of stronger hiring activity, represented a higher percentage of the revenues mix in our largest markets during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. The increase was also due to the improvement in our Manpower staffing margins in the Americas and APME, margin improvement in our Experis managed services business in Europe, and a higher percentage of revenue mix coming from our higher-margin consulting and MSP services. These increases were partially offset a lower mix of revenues coming from our higher-margin Right Management career transition business, and lower favorable direct cost adjustments. We recorded transaction costs of $6.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 relating to our acquisition of ettain group, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We also recorded restructuring costs of $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 in the Americas related to our Mexico operations as we experienced a significant revenue decline in that market driven by new labor legislation. Our operating profit margin increased 144.4% in the third quarter of 2021 while our operating profit margin increased 160 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020. Excluding acquisition transaction costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021, restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, and a loss of $5.8 million from the disposition of subsidiaries incurred in the third quarter of 2020, our operating profit was up 38.1% while operating profit margin was up 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020. The operating profit margin increased due to the improvement in our gross profit margin. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 29 Operating Results - Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to 2020. (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 5,140.6 $ 4,584.8 12.1 % 11.0 % Cost of services 4,287.6 3,859.7 11.1 % 10.0 % Gross profit 853.0 725.1 17.6 % 16.8 % Gross profit margin 16.6 % 15.8 % Selling and administrative expenses 702.5 663.5 5.9 % 5.0 % Operating profit (loss) 150.5 61.6 144.4 % 143.7 % Operating profit (loss) margin 2.9 % 1.3 % Interest and other expenses, net 4.9 6.0 (17.9 )% Earnings (loss) before income taxes 145.6 55.6 161.8 % 160.8 % Provision for income taxes 47.9 45.3 5.6 % Effective income tax rate 32.9 % 81.5 % Net earnings (loss) $ 97.7 $ 10.3 848.9 % 845.3 % Net earnings (loss) per share – diluted $ 1.77 $ 0.18 883.3 % 877.8 % Weighted average shares – diluted 55.2 58.5 (5.6 )% The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 12.1% (11.0% in constant currency and 11.3% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 30 The year-over-year 80 basis point increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: The 5.9% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2021 (5.0% in constant currency; 6.0% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to: 31 Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2020. Miscellaneous income increased to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 from $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to the increase in income from our equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.9% for the third quarter of 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 81.5% for the third quarter of 2020. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings and a discrete valuation allowance in Germany. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 32.9% effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. The COVID-19 crisis is creating uncertainty around predicting future earnings, and that uncertainty could make it more difficult for us to accurately estimate tax rates into the future. Net earnings per share - diluted was $1.77 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.18 in the third quarter of 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.07 and $0.72, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The acquisition transaction costs in the third quarter of 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2021. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 55.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 from 58.5 million in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the third quarter of 2020. Operating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to 2020.

Miscellaneous income was $11.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to miscellaneous expense of $5.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The change is primarily due to the pension settlement expenses of $10.2 million recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 related to the settlement of our United States qualified retirement plan liability and the increase in income from our equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 407.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in Germany, and a discrete valuation allowance in Germany. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.1% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, 34 tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted was earnings of $4.90 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to a loss of $0.90 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.21 per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Restructuring costs recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 negatively impacted net earnings (loss) per share – diluted by approximately $0.07 and $1.40 per share, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2021and 2020, respectively. The acquisition transaction costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $1.14 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The pension settlement expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share – diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share – diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 55.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from 58.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 7.4% (7.7% in constant currency and 7.2% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. In the United States, revenues from services increased 11.4% (10.6% on an organic basis) in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 89.4% (89.1% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 0.7% (1.7% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to increased demand for our Experis interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 141.6% (149.6% in constant currency), partially offset by the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. This improvement was driven by increases in Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 21.3%, 27.3%, 40.5%, 13.6% and 1.5%, respectively (14.8%, 69.0%, 44.7%, 29.7% and a decrease of 1.3%, respectively, in constant currency), with the increase in Argentina being primarily due to inflation. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico of 40.6% (-46.3% in constant currency) primarily due to the new labor legislation, implemented during the third quarter, that prohibits the provision of traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for specialized services outside of the client’s core business activity. Although we believe the new labor legislation will result in significant revenue reductions in Mexico over the next few quarters, we believe the mix shift towards more specialized staffing will improve the margins of our Mexico business over time. Our Mexico operations generated approximately 2.8% of our consolidated global revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. 35 In the Americas, revenues from services increased 9.7% (9.9% in constant currency and 9.4% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In the United States, revenues from services increased 10.4% (9.7% on an organic basis) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 62.9% (62.7% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 8.5% (9.0% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 90.9% (96.2% in constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of two fewer billing days. This improvement was driven by increases in Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Brazil of 21.7%, 33.8%, 14.6%, 7.2% and 11.4%, respectively (12.4%, 85.5%, 14.7%, 18.9% and 19.1%, respectively, in constant currency), with the increase in Argentina being primarily due to inflation. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico of 8.3% (-14.4% in constant currency) primarily due to the new labor legislation. Gross profit margin increased in both the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the improvements in the staffing/interim margins, partly due to favorable direct cost adjustments incurred in the third quarter of 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2021 in a market within Other Americas. The increases were also due to the increases in our permanent recruitment business, and increases in revenues from our higher-margin MSP and RPO offerings in the United States. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable changes in business mix as the higher-margin Right Management career transition business represented a lower percentage of the revenue mix. In the third quarter of 2021, selling and administrative expenses increased 12.3% (12.1% in constant currency and 11.8% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs as a result of a higher headcount as we invested in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity. The increase in salary-related costs was also due to an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets . The increase was also due to acquisition transaction costs of $6.2 million incurred in the third quarter of 2021 and an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology initiatives. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2020. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, selling and administrative expenses increased 3.2% (3.3% in constant currency and 3.0% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of an increase in profitability in certain markets. The increase was also due to acquisition transaction costs of $6.2 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and an increase in consulting costs related to certain technology initiatives. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to $5.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $29.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the decrease in software impairment charges and a decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.1% and 3.4% for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021 from 3.3% in the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, an increase in the gross profit margin and the decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by the acquisition transaction costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 3.6% in the third quarter of 2021 from 3.5% in the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.6% and 2.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 5.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from 1.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to decrease in restructuring costs, the decrease in software impairment charges, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, and an increase in the gross profit margin. The increase was partially offset by the acquisition transaction costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 3.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from 3.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs. 36 Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services increased 12.8% (11.7% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020.

The increase in France is primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, although supply chain constraints impacted the demand for our services from our automotive clients and the COVID-19 Delta variant slowed the rate of recovery, a 27.1% increase (25.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an 83.8% increase (81.8% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 9.6% (8.1% in constant currency and 10.8% in organic constant currency) during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020, due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 58.8% (56.2% in constant currency and 67.6% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the disposition of subsidiaries in Other Southern Europe in the third quarter of 2020. Revenues from services increased 26.0% (18.8% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, revenues from services increased 26.9% (19.4% in constant currency) in France and increased 40.2% (31.9% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France is primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 35.2% increase (26.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates.

Gross profit margin increased in the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increases were primarily due to the increases of 51.9% and 41.7%, respectively, (50.1% and 33.6%, respectively, in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The increase in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 was partially offset by the decrease in the Manpower staffing margin as lower margin enterprise clients represented a larger percentage of revenues during the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. 37 Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.4% (1.4% in constant currency) during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, and the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. The increase is also due to the higher non-personnel related costs to support the growth in revenues and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the third quarter of 2021 from $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2020 and the loss on disposition of subsidiaries of $5.8 million incurred in the third quarter of 2020. Selling and administrative expenses increased 10.7% (4.3% in constant currency) during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, and the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was also due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $20.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

APME Revenues from services increased 2.6% (4.0% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. In Japan (which represents 48% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 9.1% (13.2% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the 38.8% increase (44.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 12% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 27.4% (29.3% in constant currency) due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the 11.9% increase (8.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business, the 65.9% increase (66.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. Revenues from services increased 5.6% (3.3% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In Japan, revenues from services increased 9.5% (10.6% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 17.0% increase (18.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of approximately two additional billing days.

Selling and administrative expenses increased 8.8% (9.6% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Selling and administrative expenses increased 11.0% (7.2% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increases are primarily due to the increases in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues and increases in variable incentive costs as a result of increases in profitability in certain markets, and the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was also due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increases were partially offset by the decreases in restructuring costs to zero in both the third quarter of 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $1.5 million and $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business.

We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of September 30, 2021, we had $722.7 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer record United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $382.9 million and $715.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $40.8 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $577.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These changes were primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the stronger market environment as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has stabilized in many parts of the world, and an increase in accounts payable due to timing. Accounts receivable increased to $5,091.4 million as of September 30, 2021 from $4,912.4 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased to approximately 58 as of September 30, 2021 from approximately 54 as of December 31, 2020 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, as we saw during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to $30.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020 are primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $13.3 million, which mainly related to franchise acquisitions in the United States and a contingent consideration payment associated with a previous acquisition. 42 On October 1, 2021, we acquired ettain group, one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services providers in North America. Effective that date, ettain group became part of our Experis business in the Americas segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $930.9 million. Of the total consideration paid, $925.0 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $5.9 million was for excess working capital and cash. The transaction was funded through cash on hand and a $150.0 million draw on our revolving credit facility on October 1, 2021. We expect to finalize the net working capital adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2021. The acquisition of ettain group will be accounted for as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of ettain group will be included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date, and its performance will be included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The major classes of assets and liabilities of ettain group are expected to be cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, current and long-term liabilities, deferred taxes, and goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets. Net debt repayments were $1.7 million and $28.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. We reclassified the €400.0 million notes to current during the third quarter of 2021 as they are due within the next 12 months. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of September 30, 2021, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of September 30, 2021. Although our revolving credit facility for $600.0 million remained unused as of September 30, 2021, we drew $150.0 million as of October 1, 2021 in conjunction with the funding of the ettain group acquisition. We intend to repay this balance over the next 12 months. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of -0.2 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.8 to 1 as of September 30, 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of September 30, 2021, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $344.2 million, of which $317.2 was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of September 30, 2021 and for the near future. As of September 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,612.6 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash as of September 30, 2021, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to uncommitted credit lines of up to $344.2 million to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $317.2 million was available to use as of September 30, 2021. In the third quarter, we can borrow up to $600 million under these credit lines but we are limited to $300 million in other quarters. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,038.4 million as of September 30, 2021 mature in 2026 and 2022, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, notwithstanding the cash used to fund the ettain group acquisition on October 1, 2021, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. 43 The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.26 and $1.09 per share, respectively, on May 7, 2021 and May 8, 2020. The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021. The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020. In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 and 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $150.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $63.8 million. The 2021 repurchases all occurred within the first half of 2021, and the 2020 repurchases all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2021, there were 4.0 million and 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization and 2019 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,081.4 million as of September 30, 2021 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,197.6 million as of December 31, 2020. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $845.9 million and $890.0 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively ($794.3 million and $838.4 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both dates). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.4 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. We recorded net restructuring costs of $5.3 and $98.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid or utilized out of our restructuring reserve were $32.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We expect a majority of the remaining $18.9 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2021. 44 Application of Critical Accounting Policies In accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below carrying value. Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be a component of the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2021 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2021 and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests. Refer to Note 1 for results of our annual goodwill impairment testing. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consoli dated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. The COVID-19 crisis began to negatively impact our business, operations and consolidated financial statements during the last two weeks of March 2020, with significant lockdown measures implemented by the end of March 2020 in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. We continued to experience the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in the second quarter of 2021, particularly in Europe, which caused governments to impose more targeted and localized restrictions unlike the country-wide lockdowns and restrictions experienced in March 2020 and the second quarter of 2020. Although many markets strengthened throughout the first half of 2021, these restrictions had an adverse effect of curtailing economic activity in certain markets, affecting demand for our services. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We are continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations will continue to be adversely affected. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 128.1 Provisions charged to earnings 9.2 Write-offs ( 8.5 ) Translation adjustments ( 3.3 ) Reclassifications and other ( 0.1 ) Balance, June 30, 2021 $ 125.4 10 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2020 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units, both of which are part of the Northern Europe segment. The United Kingdom reporting unit had a fair value exceeding carrying value of approximately 12 %. Key assumptions included in the United Kingdom discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 were a discount rate of 11.5 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 1.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.1 %. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3.3 %. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 included a discount rate of 10.9 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. Should the operations of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units incur further decreases in the operating results, including declines in profitability and cash flow due to continued deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including uncertainty of the financial impacts from COVID-19, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands or United Kingdom reporting units, which was $ 115.8 and $ 101.3 , respectively, as of June 30, 2021, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units' fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 11 (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2021 In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to June 30, 2021, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 29.8 as of June 30, 2021 and $ 34.9 as of December 31, 2020. 12 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 4.2 and $ 6.8 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. (5) Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 13.3 and $ 1.7 , respectively. The 2021 payments mainly related to franchise acquisitions in the United States and a contingent consideration payment associated with a previous acquisition. The 2020 payment represents a deferred consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. (6) Restructuring Costs We did no t record any net restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2021 . We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 48.2 during the six months ended June 30, 2020 in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we made payments of $ 22.4 out of our restructuring reserve that was created in 2020 and 2019. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 23.7 reserve will be paid by the end of 2021. 14 Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, January 1, 2021 $ 1.9 $ 3.5 $ 40.7 $ — $ — $ 46.1 Costs paid or utilized ( 0.7 ) ( 1.9 ) ( 19.8 ) — — ( 22.4 ) Balance, June 30, 2021 $ 1.2 $ 1.6 $ 20.9 $ — $ — $ 23.7 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 1.4 and $ 0.6 as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.6 as of both December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021 . Balances related to Italy were $ 1.4 and $ 0.6 as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021 , respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.2 % for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a negative effective rate of 15.4 % for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The 2020 rate was negative due to a pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the impact from the goodwill impairment charge, related to our Germany reporting unit, which was non-deductible. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5 %, the enacted 50 % reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.2 % effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.3 % for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a negative effective rate of 62.4 % for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The 2020 rate was negative due to the noted pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the German goodwill impairment charge. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5 %, the enacted 50 % reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.3 % effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of June 30, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 66.0 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 64.5 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2014 through 2021 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of June 30, 2021, we were subject to tax audits in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 15 (8) Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share The calculations of net earnings (loss) per share - basic and net earnings (loss) per share - diluted were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders $ 111.6 $ ( 64.4 ) $ 173.6 $ ( 62.7 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 54.5 58.2 54.8 58.5 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.2 — 0.1 — Effect of other share-based awards 0.7 — 0.6 — Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 55.4 58.2 55.5 58.5 Net earnings (loss) per share - basic $ 2.05 $ ( 1.11 ) $ 3.17 $ ( 1.07 ) Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 2.02 $ ( 1.11 ) $ 3.13 $ ( 1.07 ) There were 0.1 million and 1.1 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share - diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. There were 0.2 million and 0.9 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share - diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. Due to the net loss for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020, the assumed exercise of share-based awards had an anti-dilutive effect and therefore were not included in the calculations of net loss per share - diluted for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,219.1 $ — $ 1,219.1 $ 1,225.8 $ — $ 1,225.8 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 468.8 $ 413.5 $ 55.3 $ 473.0 $ 403.8 $ 69.2 Other 22.9 18.8 4.1 21.9 21.6 0.3 491.7 432.3 59.4 494.9 425.4 69.5 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 126.0 — 126.0 127.1 — 127.1 178.0 — 178.0 179.1 — 179.1 Total intangible assets $ 669.7 $ 432.3 $ 237.4 $ 674.0 $ 425.4 $ 248.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2021 is expected to be $ 7.8 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2022 - $ 13.0 , 2023 - $ 10.6 , 2024 - $ 8.4 , 2025 - $ 6.1 and 2026 - $ 2.2 . 16 Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 536.6 $ 154.9 $ 326.6 $ 81.7 $ 126.0 $ 1,225.8 Acquisitions 3.1 — — — — 3.1 Currency impact 1.0 ( 5.0 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 3.1 ) — ( 9.8 ) Balance, June 30, 2021 $ 540.7 $ 149.9 $ 323.9 $ 78.6 $ 126.0 $ 1,219.1 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 490.2 and $ 493.3 as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 73.3 and $ 71.1 as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.2 and $ 4.1 as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2021 2020 United States $ 548.8 $ 545.7 Netherlands 115.8 119.3 United Kingdom 101.3 100.2 France 71.1 73.3 Other reporting units 382.1 387.3 Total goodwill $ 1,219.1 $ 1,225.8 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost $ 5.5 $ 5.1 $ 11.1 $ 10.2 Interest cost 1.6 2.3 3.1 4.6 Expected return on assets ( 3.0 ) ( 3.2 ) ( 6.1 ) ( 6.6 ) Settlement loss — — — 10.2 Other 1.3 0.7 2.7 1.6 Total benefit cost $ 5.4 $ 4.9 $ 10.8 $ 20.0 Retiree Health Care Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Interest cost $ — $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 Prior service credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) Other 0.1 — 0.1 — Total benefit credit $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.2 ) $ ( 0.2 ) 17 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 , contributions made to our pension plans were $ 5.0 and $ 9.4 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 and $ 0.6 , respectively. During 2021 , we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 17.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Pension Settlement During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The standard PBGC audit was completed in March 2021, and the remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement are being utilized to fund qualified 401(k) plan contributions in current and future years. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2021 2020 Foreign currency translation $ ( 140.3 ) $ ( 72.1 ) Translation loss on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 24.7 ) and $( 34.9 ), respectively ( 45.8 ) ( 81.2 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 127.1 ) ( 133.3 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 35.5 ) and $( 38.2 ), respectively ( 109.5 ) ( 111.4 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.7 and $ 1.8 , respectively 0.4 0.7 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 422.3 ) $ ( 397.3 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a benefit of $ 0.2 and $ 0.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 1.1 and $ 1.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.26 and $ 1.09 per share, respectively, on May 7, 2021 and May 8, 2020 . The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021 . The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020 . Share Repurchases In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 and 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 150.1 . During the first six months of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 63.8 . The repurchases in the first half of 2020 all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. As of June 30, 2021 , there were 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. 18 (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 9.7 $ 10.4 $ 19.9 $ 21.5 Interest income ( 3.1 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 6.2 ) ( 6.8 ) Foreign exchange loss 0.6 0.5 3.1 3.6 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 4.4 ) ( 2.0 ) ( 8.6 ) 8.0 Interest and other expenses, net $ 2.8 $ 5.8 $ 8.2 $ 26.3 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 473.7 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 589.1 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of June 30, 2021. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2021 2020 2021 2020 Euro Notes $ ( 11.3 ) $ ( 18.3 ) $ 32.4 $ ( 1.9 ) Cross-currency swaps ( 7.2 ) 9.9 13.3 2.4 19 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: (Loss) Gain Reclassified Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income Three Months Ended June 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified Three Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2021 2020 from AOCI into Income 2021 2020 Cross-currency swaps $ 2.2 $ ( 0.9 ) Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 2.0 ) $ ( 1.0 ) Gain (Loss) Reclassified (Loss) Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income Six Months Ended June 30, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified Six Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2021 2020 from AOCI into Income 2021 2020 Cross-currency swaps $ ( 3.1 ) $ 4.8 Interest and other expenses, net $ 3.2 $ 4.7 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2021 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of 20 our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was as follows: Location of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ 1.4 $ 0.5 $ ( 5.5 ) $ 0.3 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: Assets June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 7.3 $ 12.1 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net — 1.0 Total instruments $ 7.3 $ 13.1 Liabilities June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,062.8 $ 1,094.5 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 17.3 30.5 Instruments not designated as hedges Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 0.9 — Total instruments $ 1,081.0 $ 1,125.0 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,119.9 and $ 1,159.1 as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,062.8 and $ 1,094.5 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 135.0 and $ 119.4 as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). 21 (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating lease expense $ 34.9 $ 35.6 $ 70.4 $ 71.6 Short-term lease expense 1.6 3.3 3.1 7.2 Other lease expense (1) $ 4.1 $ 4.2 $ 9.0 $ 8.5 Total lease expense $ 40.6 $ 43.1 $ 82.5 $ 87.3 Other information related to leases was as follows: Six Months Ended June 30, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 69.6 $ 71.6 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 15.2 26.0 June 30, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2021 2020 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 367.2 $ 400.7 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 110.3 $ 119.3 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 272.6 305.1 Total operating lease liabilities $ 382.9 $ 424.4 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales.

These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 253.5 and $ 128.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 502.6 and $ 210.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 24 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on pages 35-37 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, as we experienced in the second quarter of 2021, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. During the second quarter of 2021, we continued to see recovery in the majority of our markets as we began to anniversary the significant COVID-19 related declines in our results that occurred during the second quarter of 2020. Revenues increased 41.0% during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the year-earlier period. Our second quarter results reflect a stronger market environment and increased demand for our services in most of our key markets indicating a strengthening rate of recovery. However, the recovery we experienced was not uniform, with some markets, particularly in Europe, continuing to experience COVID-19 related challenges. These challenges included the imposition of additional or extended lockdowns or other restrictions, which have impaired the rate of recovery. Many restrictions in place during the first quarter of 2021 continued into the second quarter and we expect to encounter targeted and localized lockdowns into the future. Although, we experienced strengthening demand across geographies and industries during the quarter, uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. In addition to the impact from COVID-19 discussed above, results for the quarter were impacted by currency. During the second quarter of 2021, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our other markets, which therefore had a favorable impact on our reported results and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 9.7% favorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.13 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To 25 understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the second quarter of 2021, our businesses experienced improvement in year-over-year revenue trends from the first quarter reflecting a stronger market environment and continued signs of a global recovery. Our consolidated revenues increased 41.0% year-over-year in the quarter, an improvement from the 6.6% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of 2021 as COVID-19 had a significant impact on the entire second quarter of 2020, especially in April and May, compared to the impact from COVID-19 only impacting the last two weeks of the first quarter of 2020. As we began to anniversary the dramatic revenue declines as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and related lockdowns imposed across many of our markets in the prior year period, we experienced significant revenue growth throughout the second quarter of 2021. Following a monthly year-over-year revenue increase in April of 50.3%, we saw revenue growth of 46.1% in May and exited the quarter with lower growth of 29.3% in June as the impact from the COVID-19 crisis was not as significant on our business in June of 2020 as it was in April and May of 2020. The significant revenue growth throughout the quarter reflects the strength of the global recovery occurring across our key markets during the quarter. During the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, most of our markets experienced revenue increases as the recovery continued to progress and as we anniversaried the sharp revenue declines due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a 64.7% revenue increase in Southern Europe, mainly driven by the increased demand in France and Italy. We experienced a 37.5% revenue increase in Northern Europe mostly due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services. Revenues increased 24.8% in the Americas driven primarily by the increase in demand for our Manpower staffing services and increased demand for our RPO and MSP offerings in the United States. We experienced a 8.9% revenue increase in APME primarily due to the increase in our Experis business. From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue increases in all of our brands during the quarter. The revenue increase in our Manpower brand was primarily due to improved demand for our staffing services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business. In our Experis brand, the revenue increase was primarily due to the improved demand for our interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business and increased demand for our managed services, primarily in Europe. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, was driven mostly by increased demand for our MSP and RPO services. Our MSP business has remained resilient during the crisis and we experienced growth during the quarter as we assisted more clients to develop customized workforce solutions. As workplaces reopen across our geographies and workers return in phased approaches, we are seeing increased demand for our HR skills within our RPO business as our clients put a greater emphasis on hiring in a challenging labor market. Our gross profit margin improved in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a favorable change in business mix as our higher-margin permanent recruitment business, which experienced a 79.1% increase (67.2% in constant currency and 68.0% in organic constant currency) during the quarter as a result of stronger hiring activity, represented a higher percentage of the revenues mix in our largest markets during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. The increase was also due to the improvement in our staffing/interim margins in the Americas, Southern Europe and APME and margin improvement in our Experis managed services business in Europe. These increases were partially offset by changes in business mix, specifically the lower mix of revenues from our higher-margin Right Management career transition business. We generated an operating profit of $169.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to an operating loss of $50.0 million in the second quarter of 2020, with our operating profit margin increasing 450 basis points to 3.2% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the goodwill and other impairment charges of $72.8 million incurred in the second quarter of 2020, our operating profit was up 645.5% while operating profit margin was up 260 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020. The operating profit margin increased as we were able to support an increase in revenues without a similar increase in our selling and administrative expenses and due to the improvement in our gross profit margin. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 26 Operating Results - Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 2020.

Interest and other expenses, net was $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020. Miscellaneous income increased to $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 from $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the increase in income from our equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.2% for the second quarter of 2021, as compared to a negative effective rate of 15.4% for the second quarter of 2020. The 2020 rate was negative due to a pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the impact from the goodwill impairment charge related to our Germany reporting unit, which was non-deductible. The 2021 rate was favorably 28 impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.2% effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. The COVID-19 crisis is creating uncertainty around predicting future earnings, and that uncertainty could make it more difficult for us to accurately estimate tax rates into the future. Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted was earnings of $2.02 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a loss of $1.11 in the second quarter of 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2021. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.23 per share, net of tax, in the second quarter of 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 55.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 from 58.2 million in the second quarter of 2020. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the second quarter of 2020. Operating Results - Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to 2020.

Miscellaneous income was $8.6 million in the first half of 2021 compared to miscellaneous expense of $8.0 million in the first half of 2020. The change is primarily due to the pension settlement expenses of $10.2 million recorded in the first half of 2020 related to the settlement of our United States qualified retirement plan liability, the increase in income from our equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, and the increase in the returns on pension plan assets. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.3% for the first half of 2021, as compared to a negative effective rate of 62.4% for the first half of 2020. The 2020 rate was negative due to the noted pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the German goodwill impairment charge. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.3% effective tax rate for the first half of 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted was earnings of $3.13 in the first half of 2021 compared to a loss of $1.07 in the first half of 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.20 per share in the first half of 2021. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in the first half of 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share - diluted by approximately $1.22 in the first half of 2020. Restructuring costs recorded in the first half of 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share – diluted by approximately $0.68 per share, net of tax, in the first half of 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 55.5 million in the first half of 2021 from 58.5 million in the first half of 2020. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first half of 2020 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the first half of 2020, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the first half of 2020. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 24.8% (22.8% in constant currency and 22.3% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. In the United States, revenues from services increased 21.9% (21.0% on an organic basis) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 103.7% (103.5% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 29.6% (24.3% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 163.0% (162.3% in constant currency). This improvement was driven by increases in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Peru of 23.4%, 37.2%, 50.3%, 41.4%, 17.8% and 32.1%, respectively (6.0%, 21.7%, 109.0%, 36.3%, 16.2% and 46.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. 31 In the Americas, revenues from services increased 10.8% (10.9% in constant currency and 10.5% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. In the United States, revenues from services increased 9.8% (9.2% on an organic basis) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020, primarily driven by increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 49.0% (48.8% on an organic basis), including our RPO offering, and increased demand for our MSP offering, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 12.3% (12.6% in constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 primarily due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 66.8% (70.7% in constant currency) partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. This improvement was driven by increases in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Peru of 6.8%, 21.9%, 37.2%, 4.0%, 16.7% and 4.2%, respectively (0.6%, 11.2%, 94.0%, 2.4%, 29.9% and 13.6%, respectively, in constant currency). The increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. Gross profit margin increased in both the second quarter and first half of 2021 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020 primarily due to the improvements in the staffing/interim margins in the United States, the increases in our permanent recruitment business, and increases in revenues from our higher-margin MSP and RPO offerings in the United States. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable changes in business mix as the higher-margin Right Management career transition business represented a lower percentage of the revenue mix. In the second quarter of 2021, selling and administrative expenses increased 10.7% (9.8% in constant currency and 9.5% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs as a result of a higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of an increase in profitability in certain markets. The increases were partially offset by the decrease in software impairment charges to zero in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2020, the decrease in discretionary expenses and a decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. In the first half of 2021, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1.4% (-1.1% in constant currency and -1.4% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first half of 2021 compared to $12.8 million in the first half of 2020, the decrease in software impairment charges, the decrease in discretionary expenses and a decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. The decreases were partially offset by the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of an increase in profitability in certain markets. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 5.4% and 2.4% for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 6.0% in the second quarter of 2021 from 1.8% in the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, an increase in the gross profit margin and the software impairment charge recorded in the first half of 2020 . Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.3% in the second quarter of 2021 from 3.3% in the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement and our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses . Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.9% and 2.0% for the first half of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 5.4% in the first half of 2021 from 1.0% in the first half of 2020 primarily due to decrease in restructuring costs, the decrease in software impairment charges, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, excluding restructuring costs and software impairment charges, and an increase in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 4.1% in the first half of 2021 from 3.4% in the first half of 2020 primarily due to the gross profit margin improvement, decrease in restructuring costs and our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses . On July 23, 2021, new legislation took effect in Mexico that prohibits the provision of traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for specialized services outside of the client’s core business activity. After evaluating client activity after the implementation date of July 23, 2021, we currently estimate that this will reduce the revenues within our Mexico business between 45% to 50% in the second half of 2021. Our Mexico operations approximated 2.8% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. 32 Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services increased 64.7% (51.0% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter of 2021, revenues from services increased 83.0% (67.3% in constant currency) in France (which represents 56% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and increased 74.7% (59.6% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 19% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 102.7% increase (85.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 151.0% increase (129.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 30.1% (20.4% in constant currency and 24.0% in organic constant currency) during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020, due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 81.1% (67.9% in constant currency and 78.4% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the disposition of subsidiaries in Other Southern Europe in the third quarter of 2020. Revenues from services increased 34.2% (23.1% in constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. In the first half of 2021, revenues from services increased 38.6% (26.8% in constant currency) in France and increased 46.2% (33.7% in constant currency) in Italy. The increase in France is primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 39.3% increase (27.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 66.4% increase (52.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rate. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 18.8% (10.0% in constant currency and 13.3% in organic constant currency) during the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020, due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 16.8% (8.9% in constant currency and 14.7% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the disposition of subsidiaries in Other Southern Europe in the third quarter of 2020. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2021 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020. The increases were primarily due to the improvements in the Manpower staffing margins in France mostly as a result of a direct cost accrual adjustment related to a payroll tax audit recorded in the second quarter and first half of 2021, and the increases of 106.3% and 37.0%, respectively, (89.5% and 26.2%, respectively, in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The increase in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 was partially offset by the decrease in the Manpower staffing margin in Italy as lower margin enterprise clients represented a larger percentage of revenues during the second quarter and first half of 2021. Selling and administrative expenses increased 31.6% (20.7% in constant currency) during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, and the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in the second quarter of 2020. The increase is also due to higher non-personnel related costs to support the growth in revenues and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expenses increased 15.3% (5.8% in constant currency) during the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 primarily due to the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount to support an increase in revenues in the quarter, an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in certain markets, and the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in the first half of 2020. The increase was also due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first half of 2021 from $13.1 million in the first half of 2020. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.8% for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 0.8% for the second quarter of 2020. In France, the OUP margin was 4.9% for the second quarter of 2021 compared to an operating unit loss margin of 0.3% for the second quarter of 2020. The increase in France was primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 6.8% for the second quarter of 2021 from 4.1% for the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in 33 the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 3.0% in the second quarter of 2021 from 0.7% in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the increase in the gross profit margin and our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.1% for the first half of 2021 compared to 1.9% for the first half of 2020. In France, the OUP margin increased to 4.3% for the first half of 2021 from 1.9% in the first half of 2020 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 5.9% for the first half of 2021 from 4.2% for the first half of 2020 primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first half of 2021 from $1.6 million in the first half of 2020, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 2.5% in the first half of 2021 from 0.4% in the first half of 2020, primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first half of 2021 from $11.5 million in the first half of 2020, our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and the increase in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 37%, 22%, 14%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 37.5% (23.1% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. We experienced revenue increases in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium of 46.6%, 39.2%, 20.1%, 21.2% and 36.9%, respectively (30.0%, 19.8%, 9.8%, 10.8% and 25.2%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue increase in Northern Europe was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 81.2% increase (62.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In Northern Europe, revenues from services increased 20.2% (9.1% in constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. We experienced revenue increases in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium of 27.4%, 22.9%, 3.2%, 11.7% and 11.8%, respectively (15.4%, 7.2%, decrease of -5.5%, 2.2% and 2.3%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue increase in Northern Europe was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 28.2% increase (16.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2021 compared to the second quarter first half of 2020 due to the increases in our permanent recruitment business in the second quarter and first half of 2021 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020, partially offset by the declines in the Manpower staffing margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues consisted of revenues from our lower-margin enterprise clients. Selling and administrative expenses increased 30.2% (16.7% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Selling and administrative expenses increased 8.2% (decrease of -1.9% in constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. The increases are primarily due to the additional variable incentive costs as a result of increased profitability in most markets, the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was also due to the decrease in benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that occurred in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 was partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first half of 2021 from $19.5 million in the first half of 2020. OUP margin for Northern Europe increased to 1.5% in the second quarter of 2021 from 0.0% in the second quarter of 2020. OUP margin for Northern Europe was 1.0% in the first half of 2021 compared to an operating unit loss margin of 0.7% in the first half of 2020.The increases were was primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses and increases in the gross profit margin. The increase in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 was also due to the decrease in restructuring costs. 34 APME Revenues from services increased 8.9% (5.5% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. In Japan (which represents 46% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 7.8% (9.7% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the 17.6% increase (19.6% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 14% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 0.3% (-15.0% in constant currency) due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of approximately three fewer billing days, partially offset by the 22.7% increase (5.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business, the 78.8% increase (71.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Revenues from services increased 7.2% (2.9% in constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. In Japan, revenues from services increased 9.7% (9.3% in constant currency) due to the increase in our Experis business, increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the 7.3% increase (7.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of approximately two additional billing days. In Australia, revenues from services increased 6.1% (decrease of -9.8% in constant currency) due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of approximately six fewer billing days. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business the 36.1% increase (31.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter and first half of 2021 compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020 primarily due to the increases in our staffing/interim margins and the increases of 27.6% and 14.0%, respectively, (16.1% and 2.9% in constant currency, respectively) in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses increased 16.6% (11.1% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Selling and administrative expenses increased 12.1% (5.9% in constant currency) in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020. The increases are primarily due to the additional variable incentive costs as a result of an increases in profitability in most markets, the increases in non-personnel related costs to support the increases in revenues and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The increase in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 was partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first half of 2021 from $2.6 million in the first half of 2020. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.6% in the second quarter of 2021 from 3.1% in the second quarter of 2020. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.3% in the first half of 2021 from 3.0% in the first half of 2020. The increases are due to the improvements in the gross profit margins, partially offset by the increases in variable incentive costs. The increase in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 was also due to the decrease in restructuring costs. Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not 35 generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of June 30, 2021, we had $1,348.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer record United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $195.4 million and $596.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $25.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $527.8 million of cash generated during the six months ended June 30, 2020. These changes were primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the stronger market environment as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has stabilized in many parts of the world. Accounts receivable increased to $5,203.3 million as of June 30, 2021 from $4,912.4 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased to approximately 56 as of June 30, 2021 from approximately 54 as of December 31, 2020 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, as we saw during the first half of 2021, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating 37 cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $24.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $18.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020 are primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $13.3 million, which mainly related to franchise acquisitions in the United States and a contingent consideration payment associated with a previous acquisition. Net debt borrowings were $1.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net debt payments of $16.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of June 30, 2021, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of June 30, 2021. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.1 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.2 to 1 as of June 30, 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of June 30, 2021 and for the near future. As of June 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,461.4 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600.0 million of additional cash, which remains unused as of June 30, 2021, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300.0 million ($600.0 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $269.5 million was available to use as of June 30, 2021. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,062.8 million as of June 30, 2021 mature in 2026 and 2022, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.26 and $1.09 per share, respectively, on May 7, 2021 and May 8, 2020. The 2021 dividends were paid on June 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2021. The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020. In August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 4.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization was in addition to the August 2019 and 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $150.1 million. During the first six months of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares 38 under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $63.8 million. The repurchases in the first half of 2020 all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. As of June 30, 2021, there were 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,126.1 million as of June 30, 2021 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,197.6 million as of December 31, 2020. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $958.3 million and $890.0 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively ($906.7 million and $838.4 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both dates). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.9 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. We did not record any net restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2021. We recorded net restructuring costs of $48.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid or utilized out of our restructuring reserve were $22.4 million during the first half of 2021. We expect a majority of the remaining $23.7 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2021. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. The COVID-19 crisis began to negatively impact our business, operations and consolidated financial statements during the last two weeks of March 2020, with significant lockdown measures implemented by the end of March 2020 in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. We continued to experience the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in the first quarter of 2021, particularly in Europe, which caused governments to impose more targeted and localized restrictions unlike the country-wide lockdowns and restrictions experienced in March 2020 and the second quarter of 2020. Although many markets strengthened throughout the first quarter of 2021, these restrictions had an adverse effect of curtailing economic activity in certain markets, affecting demand for our services. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We are continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations will continue to be adversely affected. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 128.1 Provisions charged to earnings 5.2 Write-offs ( 4.9 ) Translation adjustments ( 4.5 ) Reclassifications and other 0.2 Balance, March 31, 2021 $ 124.1 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 8 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization , lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2020 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units, both of which are part of the Northern Europe segment. The United Kingdom reporting unit had a fair value exceeding carrying value of approximately 12 %. Key assumptions included in the United Kingdom discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 were a discount rate of 11.5 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 1.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.1 %. The Netherlands reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3.3 %. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 included a discount rate of 10.9 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. Should the operations of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units incur further decreases in the operating results, including declines in profitability and cash flow due to continued deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including uncertainty of the financial impacts from COVID-19, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands or United Kingdom reporting units, which were $ 114.6 and $ 101.0 , respectively, as of March 31, 2021 could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units fair values exceeded 20 % or more of their respective carrying values, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2021 In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance 9 addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2021 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offerings related to alternative reference interest rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. We are currently assessing the impact of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates. This adoption has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to March 31, 2021, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 35.1 at March 31, 2021 and $ 34.9 at December 31, 2020. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types. 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 510.1 $ 28.8 $ 28.5 $ 41.4 $ 608.8 $ 518.7 $ 30.1 $ 25.0 $ 37.1 $ 610.9 Other Americas 374.9 9.9 6.1 3.2 394.1 379.5 12.4 5.5 2.7 400.1 885.0 38.7 34.6 44.6 1,002.9 898.2 42.5 30.5 39.8 1,011.0 Southern Europe: France 1,084.0 86.5 12.8 5.6 1,188.9 998.3 78.1 12.5 4.9 1,093.8 Italy 381.5 7.7 9.7 3.9 402.8 307.1 8.7 8.2 3.7 327.7 Other Southern Europe 460.8 92.6 11.7 3.5 568.6 415.9 90.6 13.9 2.8 523.2 1,926.3 186.8 34.2 13.0 2,160.3 1,721.3 177.4 34.6 11.4 1,944.7 Northern Europe 1,018.8 64.8 29.5 20.7 1,133.8 949.6 70.9 31.3 16.7 1,068.5 APME 480.8 98.4 37.4 10.8 627.4 466.6 83.2 36.9 8.2 594.9 Total $ 4,310.9 $ 388.7 $ 135.7 $ 89.1 $ 4,924.4 $ 4,035.7 $ 374.0 $ 133.3 $ 76.1 $ 4,619.1 10 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by timing of revenue recognition for each of our reportable segments: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 594.7 $ 14.1 $ 608.8 $ 597.8 $ 13.1 $ 610.9 Other Americas 390.2 3.9 394.1 396.5 3.6 400.1 984.9 18.0 1,002.9 994.3 16.7 1,011.0 Southern Europe: France 1,176.9 12.0 1,188.9 1,082.1 11.7 1,093.8 Italy 393.5 9.3 402.8 320.0 7.7 327.7 Other Southern Europe 558.9 9.7 568.6 511.5 11.7 523.2 2,129.3 31.0 2,160.3 1,913.6 31.1 1,944.7 Northern Europe 1,107.8 26.0 1,133.8 1,041.4 27.1 1,068.5 APME 607.9 19.5 627.4 575.3 19.6 594.9 Total $ 4,829.9 $ 94.5 $ 4,924.4 $ 4,524.6 $ 94.5 $ 4,619.1 (4) Share-Based Compensation Plans During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $ 7.5 and $ 4.6 , respectively. The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 1.7 and $ 10.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our annual grant of share-based compensation generally takes place during the first quarter of each fiscal year. The number of shares granted to employees and members of our Board of Directors, and the weighted-average fair value per share for shares granted during the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 are presented in the table below: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Fair Value Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Fair Value Stock Options 130 $ 22.83 156 $ 18.95 Deferred Stock Units 12 90.18 11 97.10 Restricted Stock Units 197 85.66 188 86.47 Performance Share Units 203 84.34 119 85.25 Total Shares Granted 542 $ 70.19 474 $ 64.18 (5) Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 12.9 , which includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. No cash consideration was paid for acquisitions for the three months ended March 31, 2020. (6) Restructuring Costs We did no t record any net restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2021. We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 48.2 during the three months ended March 31, 2020, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we made payments of $ 13.8 out of our restructuring reserve that was created in 2020 and 2019. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 32.3 reserve will be paid by the end of 2021. 11 Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas ( 1) Southern Europe ( 2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, January 1, 2021 $ 1.9 $ 3.5 $ 40.7 $ — $ — $ 46.1 Costs paid or utilized ( 0.5 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 12.2 ) — — ( 13.8 ) Balance, March 31, 2021 $ 1.4 $ 2.4 $ 28.5 $ — $ — $ 32.3 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 1.4 and $ 0.9 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.6 and $ 0.5 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. Balances related to Italy were $ 1.4 and $ 1.1 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.3 % for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 90.2 % for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5 %, the enacted 50 % reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.3% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. As of March 31, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 65.2 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 64.5 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2014 through 2021 for our major operations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of March 31, 2021, we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 62.0 $ 1.7 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 55.1 58.7 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 - Effect of other share-based awards 0.5 0.3 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 55.7 59.0 Net earnings per share - basic $ 1.12 $ 0.03 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 1.11 $ 0.03 There were no shares and 0.6 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 12 (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill ( 1) $ 1,215.0 $ — $ 1,215.0 $ 1,225.8 $ — $ 1,225.8 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 467.4 $ 408.9 $ 58.5 $ 473.0 $ 403.8 $ 69.2 Other 22.6 18.1 4.5 21.9 21.6 0.3 490.0 427.0 63.0 494.9 425.4 69.5 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames ( 2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 125.4 — 125.4 127.1 — 127.1 177.4 — 177.4 179.1 — 179.1 Total intangible assets $ 667.4 $ 427.0 $ 240.4 $ 674.0 $ 425.4 $ 248.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2021 is expected to be $ 11.8 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2022- $ 13.1 , 2023- $ 10.6 , 2024- $ 8.3 , 2025 - $ 6.1 , 2026- $ 2.2 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas ( 1) Southern Europe ( 2) Northern Europe APME Corporate ( 3 ) Total Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 536.6 $ 154.9 $ 326.6 $ 81.7 $ 126.0 $ 1,225.8 Acquisitions 2.9 — — — — 2.9 Currency impact 0.5 ( 7.0 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 2.3 ) — ( 13.7 ) Balance, March 31, 2021 $ 540.0 $ 147.9 $ 321.7 $ 79.4 $ 126.0 $ 1,215.0 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 490.2 and $ 493.1 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 73.3 and $ 70.4 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.2 and $ 4.0 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2021 2020 United States $ 548.6 $ 545.7 Netherlands 114.6 119.3 United Kingdom 101.0 100.2 France 70.4 73.3 Other reporting units 380.4 387.3 Total goodwill $ 1,215.0 $ 1,225.8 13 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, Defined Benefit Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost $ 5.6 $ 5.1 $ — $ — Interest cost 1.5 2.3 0.1 0.1 Expected return on assets ( 3.1 ) ( 3.4 ) — — Settlement loss - 10.2 — — Other 1.4 0.9 ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) Total benefit cost (credit) $ 5.4 $ 15.1 $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) During the three months ended March 31, 2021, contributions made to our pension plans were $ 4.4 and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 . During 2021, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 16.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Pension Settlement During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The standard PBGC audit was completed in March 2021, and the remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement will be utilized to fund future qualified 401(k) plan contributions. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Foreign currency translation $ ( 168.6 ) $ ( 72.1 ) Translation loss on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $( 20.5 ) and $( 34.9 ), respectively ( 31.6 ) ( 81.2 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 127.7 ) ( 133.3 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income tax benefit of $( 37.9 ) and $( 38.2 ), respectively ( 110.4 ) ( 111.4 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.8 for both 2021 and 2020 0.5 0.7 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 437.8 ) $ ( 397.3 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded income of $ 0.9 and expenses of $ 0.6 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Share Repurchases In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a cost of $ 100.1 . During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 63.8 . As of March 31, 2021, there were 2.3 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. 14 (12) Interest and Other Expenses, Net Interest and other expenses, net consisted of the following: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 10.2 $ 11.1 Interest income ( 3.1 ) ( 3.7 ) Foreign exchange loss 2.5 3.1 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 4.2 ) 10.0 Interest and other expenses, net $ 5.4 $ 20.5 (1) Miscellaneous expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2020 includes a $ 10.2 pension settlement loss related to one of our United States plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 468.5 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 582.6 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of March 31, 2021. 15 In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 3 Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2021 2020 Euro Notes $ 43.7 $ 16.4 Cross-currency swaps 20.5 ( 7.5 ) Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: Gain (Loss) Reclassified Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 3 Months Ended March 31, Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified 3 Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2021 2020 from AOCI into Income 2021 2020 Cross-currency swaps $ ( 5.3 ) $ 5.7 Interest and other expenses, net $ 5.2 $ 5.7 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at March 31, 2021 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. 16 Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was as follows: Location of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses, net $ ( 6.9 ) $ ( 0.2 ) The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: Assets March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 4.2 $ 12.1 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net — 1.0 Total instruments $ 4.2 $ 13.1 Liabilities March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,051.1 $ 1,094.5 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 10.1 30.5 Instruments not designated as hedges Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities 5.9 — Total instruments $ 1,067.1 $ 1,125.0 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,112.2 and $ 1,159.1 as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,051.1 and $ 1,094.5 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 128.6 and $ 119.4 as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs).

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 19 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 608.8 $ 610.9 Other Americas 394.1 400.1 1,002.9 1,011.0 Southern Europe: France 1,188.9 1,093.8 Italy 402.8 327.7 Other Southern Europe 568.6 523.2 2,160.3 1,944.7 Northern Europe 1,133.8 1,068.5 APME 627.4 594.9 Consolidated (b) $ 4,924.4 $ 4,619.1 Operating unit profit (loss): (c) Americas: United States $ 29.2 $ 2.3 Other Americas 14.9 14.3 44.1 16.6 Southern Europe: France 42.6 38.0 Italy 19.4 14.2 Other Southern Europe 11.4 0.8 73.4 53.0 Northern Europe 4.8 ( 14.1 ) APME 18.8 16.9 141.1 72.4 Corporate expenses ( 37.2 ) ( 27.8 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 5.5 ) ( 6.9 ) Operating profit 98.4 37.7 Interest and other expenses, net ( 5.4 ) ( 20.5 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 93.0 $ 17.2 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.1 and $ 3.0 for the three months ended March 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, as we experienced in the first quarter of 2021, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. During the first quarter of 2021, we continued to see some recovery in the majority of our markets as we began to anniversary the significant COVID-19 related declines in our results that occurred during the last two weeks of the first quarter of 2020. Revenues increased 6.6% during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the year-earlier period. Our first quarter results reflect a stronger market environment and increased demand for our services in many of our key markets. Overall, we saw an increasing monthly rate of recovery as the quarter progressed, although the pandemic continued to limit the demand for our services across almost all of our operations. Furthermore, the recovery we experienced was not uniform, with some markets, particularly in Europe, continuing to experience COVID-19 related challenges. These challenges included the imposition of additional or extended lockdowns or other restrictions, which have impaired the rate of recovery. These restrictions have continued into the second quarter of 2021 and we expect to encounter targeted and localized lockdowns into the future. Although continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies, we have experienced strengthening demand across geographies and industries during the quarter and we expect the recovery will continue to move in a positive direction. In addition to the impact from COVID-19 discussed above, results for the quarter were impacted by currency. During the first quarter of 2021, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets, except in Other Americas, which therefore had a favorable impact on our reported results and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 6.0% favorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.06 per share favorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings 21 are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, our businesses experienced improvement in year-over-year revenue trends from the fourth quarter reflecting a stronger market environment and continued signs of a global recovery. Our consolidated revenues increased 6.6% year-over-year in the quarter, an improvement from the 2.7% year-over-year decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020. As we began to anniversary the dramatic revenue declines as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and related lockdowns imposed by the European governments in the prior year period, specifically during the last two weeks of March 2020, we experienced a crossover from revenue declines to revenue growth throughout the first quarter of 2021. Following a monthly year-over-year revenue decline in January of 4.6% as some seasonal logistics work ended, we saw revenue growth of 3.4% in February and exited the quarter with growth of 22.5% in March. The progressive improvement from year-over-year revenue declines to revenue growth during the quarter reflects the continued increase in activity levels as the recovery continued to take hold across our key markets during the quarter, including strengthening demand for talent within the manufacturing sectors. On an overall basis, our Talent Solutions business, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, experienced an increase in the quarter, which was driven mostly by increased demand for our MSP and RPO services. Our MSP business has remained resilient during the crisis and we experienced growth during the quarter as we assisted more clients to develop customized workforce solutions during the economic downturn. As workplaces reopen across our geographies and workers return in phased approaches, we are seeing increased demand for our HR skills within our RPO business as our clients put a greater emphasis on hiring. During the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, most of our markets experienced revenue increases as the recovery continued to progress and as we anniversaried the sharp revenue declines in the last two weeks of March 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a revenue increase in Southern Europe, mainly driven by the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and increased demand in Italy. We experienced a revenue increase in Northern Europe mostly due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the increased demand in the United Kingdom. Revenues decreased 0.8% in the Americas driven by the decrease in the United States primarily due to the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates in the markets within Other Americas. We experienced a 5.5% revenue increase in APME mostly from the increase in Japan, which was mainly due to an increase in demand for our staffing/interim revenues. Our gross profit margin declined in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an unfavorable change in business mix as the higher-margin permanent recruitment business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease was also due to the decline in our staffing/interim margins in the Americas, Southern Europe and Northern Europe as a result of the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business. These decreases were partially offset by a higher mix of MSP gross profit due to strong growth during the quarter and the increase in staffing/interim margins in APME primarily due to the improvement in Japan. Our operating profit increased 160.9% in the first quarter of 2021 while our operating profit margin increased 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the restructuring costs in the prior year, our operating profit was up 14.4% while operating profit margin was up 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The operating profit margin increased as we were able to increase our revenues while experiencing a decrease in our selling and administrative expenses due to the strategic initiatives and strong cost actions put in place in late March and early April of 2020. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. 22 Operating Results - Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 4,924.4 $ 4,619.1 6.6 % 0.6 % Cost of services 4,156.3 3,895.1 6.7 % 0.6 % Gross profit 768.1 724.0 6.1 % 0.5 % Gross profit margin 15.6 % 15.7 % Selling and administrative expenses 669.7 686.3 (2.4 )% (7.5 )% Operating profit 98.4 37.7 160.9 % 145.7 % Operating profit margin 2.0 % 0.8 % Interest and other expenses, net 5.4 20.5 (73.6 )% Earnings before income taxes 93.0 17.2 439.2 % 409.7 % Provision for income taxes 31.0 15.5 99.3 % Effective income tax rate 33.3 % 90.2 % Net earnings $ 62.0 $ 1.7 3562.0 % 3361.0 % Net earnings per share – diluted $ 1.11 $ 0.03 3600.0 % 3400.0 % Weighted average shares – diluted 55.7 59.0 (5.7 )% The year-over-year increase in revenues from services of 6.6% (0.6% in constant currency and 0.9% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue increase in Southern Europe of 11.1% (2.0% in constant currency). This included a revenue increase in France of 8.7% (-0.5% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. The increase also includes an increase in Italy of 22.9% (12.5% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, an 18.1% increase (8.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day; • a revenue increase in Northern Europe of 6.1% (-2.3 % in constant currency), primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the 5.4% decrease (-13.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced revenue increases in the United Kingdom, the Nordics and the Netherlands of 12.4%, 8.4% and 3.7%, respectively (4.0%, -3.9% and -5.1%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by revenue declines in Germany and Belgium of 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively (-17.4% and -14.8%, respectively, in constant currency); • a revenue increase in APME of 5.5% (0.3% in constant currency) primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the increase in demand for our staffing/interim services in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day in the quarter; partially offset by • a revenue decrease in the United States of 0.3% (-0.7% on an organic basis) primarily driven by decreased demand for our staffing/interim service due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 14.5% (14.3% on an organic basis) and increased demand for our RPO and MSP offerings; and • a 6.0% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 10 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 10 basis point unfavorable change in business mix as the higher-margin permanent recruitment business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix; and 23 • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from declines in the staffing/interim margins in the Americas , Southern Europe and Northern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business ; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from the growth in our higher-margin MSP services within our Talent Solutions business. The 2.4 % decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2021 (-7.5% in constant currency; -7.2% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • restructuring costs of $48.2 million incurred in the first quarter of 2020; and • a 0.4% decrease (-5.7% in constant currency and -5.5% in organic constant currency) in non-personnel related costs, excluding restructuring costs, primarily driven by a reduction in discretionary expenses and a decline in office-related expenses due to a decrease in the number of offices; partially offset by • a 5.1% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and • a 7.7% increase (2.1% in constant currency and 2.3% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs due to the increase in variable incentive costs as a result of an increase in profitability in most markets. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 130 basis points in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to: • a 100 basis point favorable impact as a result of the decrease in restructuring costs from $48.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to zero in the first quarter of 2021; • a 30 basis point favorable impact due to the decrease in non-personnel related costs, excluding restructuring costs; and • a 10 basis point favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in variable incentive costs. Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net interest expense decreased $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $7.1 million from $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. Miscellaneous income was $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to miscellaneous expense of $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. The change is primarily due to the pension settlement expenses of $10.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 related to one of our United States plans, the increase in income from our equity investment in ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, and the increase in the returns on pension plan assets. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 33.3% for three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to an effective rate of 90.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The 2021 rate was favorably impacted by the scheduled reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 27.5%, the enacted 50% reduction in the French business tax rate, and a higher level of pre-tax earnings. The 33.3% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the overall mix of earnings. The COVID-19 crisis is creating uncertainty around predicting future earnings, and that uncertainty could make it more difficult for us to accurately estimate tax rates into the future. Net earnings per share - diluted was $1.11 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.03 in the first quarter of 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.68 per share, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2020. The pension settlement expense recorded in the first quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 55.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 from 59.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first quarter of 2020 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the first quarter of 2021. 24 Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 0.8% (increase of 1.1% in constant currency and 0.8% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 0.3% (-0.7% on an organic basis) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily driven by decreased demand for our staffing/interim services due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day during the quarter. The decreased demand for staffing/interim services in the United States was partially offset by increased demand for our MSP and RPO offerings along with a 14.5% increase (14.3% in organic constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.5% (increase of 3.3% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. This decline was driven by decreases in Mexico, Colombia and Peru of 5.8%, 19.0% and 14.8%, respectively (-3.6%, -18.4% and -8.3%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by increases in Argentina, Canada and Brazil of 25.2%, 8.1% and 15.7%, respectively (80.3%, 1.7% and 42.3%, respectively, in constant currency). The increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to gross profit margin increases in the United States from the increase in revenues from our higher-margin MSP and RPO offerings as well as the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 14.3% (15.4% in constant currency; 15.3% in organic constant currency). This increase was partially offset by the declines in the staffing/interim margin due to client mix changes, particularly in the United States, as a higher percentage of revenues came from our lower margin enterprise clients. In the first quarter of 2021, selling and administrative expenses decreased 11.5% (-10.3% in constant currency and -10.5% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, the decrease in discretionary expenses and a decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. The decreases were partially offset by the increase in salary-related costs due to higher headcount in the quarter and an increase in variable incentive costs as a result of an increase in profitability in certain markets. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.4% and 1.6% for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 4.8% in the first quarter of 2021 from 0.4% in the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs and an increase in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin increased to 3.8% in the first quarter of 2021 from 3.6% in the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin. On April 23, 2021, new legislation was enacted in Mexico that will prohibit the provision of traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for specialized services outside of the client’s core business activity. The effective date for the new law is July 23, 2021. We are currently assessing the magnitude of the impact that this new legislation will have on our Mexico business pending the issuance of the final implementation and transition rules. We expect that the new legislation will reduce revenues and operating unit profit within our Mexico operations. Our Mexico operations approximated 2.8% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services increased 11.1% (2.0% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, revenues from services increased 8.7% (decrease of -0.5% in constant currency) in France (which represents 55% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and increased 22.9% (12.5% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 19% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The increase in France is primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day. The increase in Italy was primarily due to the increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and an 18.1% increase (8.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 8.7% (0.8% in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, due to increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, 25 partially offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 17.4% (-22.5% in constant currency) due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the disposition of subsidiaries in Other Southern Europe in the third quarter of 2020 . Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the decrease of 1.9% (-9.5% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the decrease in the staffing/interim gross profit margin as lower margin enterprise clients represented a larger percentage of revenues during the first quarter of 2021. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.3% (decrease of -6.0% in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and an increase in variable incentive costs due to an increase in profitability in certain markets. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first quarter of 2021 from $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 and the reduction in discretionary expenses. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 3.4% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2.7% for the first quarter of 2020. In France, the OUP margin increased to 3.6% for the first quarter of 2021 from 3.5% in the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to our ability to increase revenues without a similar increase in expenses, partially offset by the decrease in the overall gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 4.8% for the first quarter of 2021 from 4.3% for the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first quarter of 2021 from $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2020. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 2.0% in the first quarter of 2021 from 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first quarter of 2021 from $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, the Nordics, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 38%, 20%, 14%, 11%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services increased 6.1% (decrease of -2.3% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. We experienced revenue increases in the United Kingdom, the Nordics and the Netherlands of 12.4%, 8.4% and 3.7%, respectively (increase of 4.0%, decrease of -3.9% and decrease of -5.1%, respectively, in constant currency) and revenue decreases in Germany and Belgium of 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively (-17.4% and -14.8%, respectively, in constant currency). The revenue increase in Northern Europe was due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the increase in demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily in the United Kingdom, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our Experis interim services and a 5.4% decrease (-13.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, and the decline in the Manpower staffing margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues consisted of revenues from our lower-margin enterprise clients. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 7.8% (-15.6% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the first quarter of 2021 from $19.5 million in the first quarter of 2020, the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the decrease in non-personnel and discretionary costs. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in variable incentive costs due to an increase in profitability in certain markets. OUP margin for Northern Europe increased to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2021 from an operating unit loss of 1.3% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin. APME Revenues from services increased 5.5% (0.3% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. In Japan (which represents 45% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 11.8% (8.9 % in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day, partially offset by a 3.5% decrease (-5.9% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia (which represents 17% of 26 APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 12.3% ( decrease of -4.8% in constant currency) due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately three fewer billing days. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the decline in demand for our staffing/interim services due to the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates . Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the increase in our staffing/interim margin, mostly in Japan. Selling and administrative expenses increased 7.9% (0.9% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the increase in variable incentive costs due to an increase in profitability in certain markets. These were partially offset by the decrease of restructuring costs to zero in the first quarter of 2021 from $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2020. OUP margin for APME increased to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2021 from 2.9% in the first quarter of 2020 due to the increase in the gross profit margin and the decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by the increase in variable incentive costs. Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. 27 Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2021 Compared to 2020 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States 608.8 (0.3 )% — (0.3 )% 0.4 % (0.7 )% Other Americas 394.1 (1.5 )% (4.8 )% 3.3 % — 3.3 % 1,002.9 (0.8 )% (1.9 )% 1.1 % 0.3 % 0.8 % Southern Europe: France 1,188.9 8.7 % 9.2 % (0.5 )% — (0.5 )% Italy 402.8 22.9 % 10.4 % 12.5 % — 12.5 % Other Southern Europe 568.6 8.7 % 7.9 % 0.8 % (3.0 )% 3.8 % 2,160.3 11.1 % 9.1 % 2.0 % (0.8 )% 2.8 % Northern Europe 1,133.8 6.1 % 8.4 % (2.3 )% — (2.3 )% APME 627.4 5.5 % 5.2 % 0.3 % — 0.3 % Consolidated 4,924.4 6.6 % 6.0 % 0.6 % (0.3 )% 0.9 % Gross Profit 768.1 6.1 % 5.6 % 0.5 % (0.1 )% 0.6 % Selling and Administrative Expenses 669.7 (2.4 )% 5.1 % (7.5 )% (0.3 )% (7.2 )% Operating Profit 98.4 160.9 % 15.2 % 145.7 % 6.6 % 139.1 % (a) In millions for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of March 31, 2021, we had $1,365.6 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer record United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million and $181.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $58.9 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $147.7 million of cash generated during the three months ended March 31, 2020. These changes were primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to the stronger market environment as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has stabilized in many parts of the world. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,892.1 million as of March 31, 2021 from $4,912.4 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease is due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased to approximately 56 as of March 31, 2021 from approximately 54 as of December 31, 2020 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, as we saw during the first quarter of 2021, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. 28 Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. Capital expenditures were $12.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020 are primarily due to additional technology investments and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $12.9 million, which includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. Net debt borrowings were $2.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to net debt payments of $9.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of March 31, 2021, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of March 31, 2021. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of -0.09 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.39 to 1 as of March 31, 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of March 31, 2021 and for the near future. As of March 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,522.7 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600 million of additional cash, which remains unused as of March 31, 2021, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300 million ($600 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $268.5 million was available to use as of March 31, 2021. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,051.1 million as of March 31, 2021 mature in 2026 and 2022, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorization to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization at a total cost of $100.1 million. During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a cost of $63.8 million. As of March 31, 2021, there were 2.3 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. 29 We had aggregate commitments of $ 2 , 169 . 9 m illion as of March 31, 2021 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $ 2 , 197 . 6 million as of December 31, 2020 . We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling $897.0 million and $890.0 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively ($845.4 million and $838.4 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both dates). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.5 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. We did not record any net restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2021. We recorded net restructuring costs of $48.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. The costs paid or utilized out of our restructuring reserve were $13.8 million during the first quarter of 2021. We expect a majority of the remaining $32.3 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2021. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. Our business, operations and consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. By the end of March, significant lockdown measures had been implemented in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. At the beginning of the third quarter, it appeared the impact of the COVID-19 crisis was stabilizing in many parts of the world, and economies slowly reopened. However, as the third quarter came to a close, a number of countries started to see increased cases of COVID-19 that are leading to the implementation of new restrictions in an effort to mitigate the spread. Unlike the lockdowns and restrictions experienced earlier in the year, we do not anticipate the same country-wide lockdowns, but more targeted and localized restrictions. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We are continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations will continue to be adversely affected. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 113.5 Provisions charged to earnings 17.8 Write-offs ( 12.7 ) Translation adjustments 3.5 Reclassifications and other 3.2 Balance, September 30, 2020 $ 125.3 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 9 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization , lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payroll Tax Credit In April 2019, we sold a portion of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ). We derecognized these receivables and the additional interest upon the sale date as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment in accordance with the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. For the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included sustained operating losses resulted from the ongoing decline and increased uncertainty in the outlook of the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector in Germany, coupled with the significant implications of COVID-19. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 66.8 , which resulted in full impairment of the remaining goodwill in the Germany reporting unit. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value for our Germany reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test and our quarterly assessments in the intervening periods due to the factors discussed above. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2020 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote down the carrying value of the Germany reporting unit to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $ 60.2 during the second quarter of 2019. 10 The table below provides our reporting units’ estimated fair values and carrying values, determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter, representing approximately 80 % of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2020. (in millions) France United States Right Management United Kingdom Canada Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 2,367.8 $ 1,194.0 $ 383.3 $ 360.9 $ 153.2 $ 84.5 Carrying values 1,320.7 758.2 117.9 321.5 84.9 81.8 The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the United Kingdom and Netherlands reporting units. The United Kingdom reporting unit had a fair value exceeding carrying value of approximately 12 %. Key assumptions included in the United Kingdom (Northern Europe Segment) discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 were a discount rate of 11.5 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 1.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.1 %. The Netherlands reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 %, approximating 3.3 %. The Netherlands is part of the Northern Europe Segment. Key assumptions included in the Netherlands discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2020 included a discount rate of 10.9 %, a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0 %, and a terminal value OUP margin of 3.5 %. Should the operations of the business incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, some or all of the recorded goodwill for the Netherlands reporting unit, which was $ 114.5 million as of September 30, 2020, could be subject to impairment. While our other reporting units fair values exceeded 10 % or more of their respective carrying values, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2020 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the previous methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable that loss has been incurred. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020 . The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. 11 The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to September 30, 2020, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 7.4 and $ 6.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 1.7 , which represents a deferred consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. On September 30, 2020 we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for net proceeds of $ 5.8 , subject to normal post close working capital adjustments and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $ 5.8 , which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Switzerland Acquisitions 14 On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 219.5 as of September 30 , 2019 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 161.2 was for cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate cash consideration paid reflects a post-closing settlement of net debt and net working capital adjustments of $ 6.8 , which we paid out during the third quarter of 2019. The total cash impact of the acquisition was an inflow of $ 98.0 , net of cash acquired of $ 317.5 . The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 80.4 , $ 32.5 represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. Excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 39.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This balance represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 13.0 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited Disposition On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51 % controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25 % of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25 %, and then further diluted to 36.87 % as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for the remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time cash gain of $ 30.4 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Included in the $ 30.4 was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $ 6.2 related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive income. (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 98.1 and $ 42.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $ 22.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $ 55.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 49.9 reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 0.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ — $ — $ 7.3 Severance costs 5.5 16.2 43.4 2.5 0.2 67.8 Office closure costs 19.6 2.3 0.2 0.5 — 22.6 Other costs 4.4 2.2 — 1.1 — 7.7 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out ( 25.1 ) ( 15.6 ) ( 11.1 ) ( 3.5 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 55.5 ) Balance, September 30, 2020 $ 4.8 $ 5.8 $ 38.7 $ 0.6 $ - $ 49.9 15 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.3 and $ 4.3 as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020 , respectively. (2) France had no restructuring reserve as of both December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.3 and $ 1.8 as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 81.5 % for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 28.6 % for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, tax losses in certain countries for which we did no t recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, including the recognition of a discrete valuation allowance in Germany, and the French business tax. The French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in the quarter due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. The effective tax rate of 81.5 % for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was significantly higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the factors noted above. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 407.4 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 34.5 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, tax losses in certain countries for which we did no t recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, including the recognition of a discrete valuation allowance in Germany, the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in Germany, and the French business tax. The effective tax rate of 407.4 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was significantly higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the factors noted above. As of September 30, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 68.2 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 69.5 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2013 through 2020 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of September 30, 2020, we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share The calculations of net earnings (loss) per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders $ 10.3 $ 146.1 $ ( 52.4 ) $ 326.9 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 58.2 59.9 58.4 60.2 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.1 — 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.3 0.3 — 0.3 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 58.5 60.3 58.4 60.6 Net earnings (loss) per share - basic $ 0.18 $ 2.44 $ ( 0.90 ) $ 5.43 Net earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.18 $ 2.42 $ ( 0.90 ) $ 5.40 Due to the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the assumed exercise of share-based awards had an anti-dilutive effect and therefore was not included in the calculations of net loss per share – diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. There were 0.7 million and 0.4 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 1.5 million and 0.4 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share - diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 16 (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,198.6 $ — $ 1,198.6 $ 1,260.1 $ — $ 1,260.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 465.5 $ 397.1 $ 68.4 $ 460.5 $ 375.7 $ 84.8 Other 21.0 15.7 5.3 20.9 13.7 7.2 486.5 412.8 73.7 481.4 389.4 92.0 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 125.8 — 125.8 124.6 — 124.6 177.8 — 177.8 176.6 — 176.6 Total intangible assets $ 664.3 $ 412.8 $ 251.5 $ 658.0 $ 389.4 $ 268.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 and $ 577.4 as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2020 is expected to be $ 6.8 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2021- $ 16.3 , 2022- $ 13.0 , 2023- $ 10.4 , 2024 - $ 8.0 , 2025- $ 6.0 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2)(3 ) Northern Europe (3) APME Corporate (4) Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 535.6 $ 144.8 $ 374.6 $ 79.1 $ 126.0 $ 1,260.1 Currency & other impacts ( 1.3 ) 5.1 1.3 0.2 — 5.3 Impairment Charge — — ( 66.8 ) — — ( 66.8 ) Balance, September 30, 2020 $ 534.3 $ 149.9 $ 309.1 $ 79.3 $ 126.0 $ 1,198.6 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 490.3 and $ 490.2 as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 67.3 and $ 70.3 as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.6 and $ 4.0 as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020. (3) The impairment charge of $ 66.8 relates to our Germany reporting unit, which was recorded during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (4) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. 17 Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2020 2019 United States $ 545.7 $ 545.8 Netherlands 114.5 109.5 United Kingdom 94.7 97.3 France 70.3 67.3 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Germany — 67.2 Other reporting units 311.3 310.9 Total goodwill $ 1,198.6 $ 1,260.1 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost $ 5.3 $ 4.1 $ 15.5 $ 10.9 Interest cost 2.4 3.2 7.0 9.5 Expected return on assets ( 3.4 ) ( 3.5 ) ( 10.0 ) ( 9.4 ) Settlement loss — — 10.2 — Other 0.9 0.5 2.5 1.4 Total benefit cost $ 5.2 $ 4.3 $ 25.2 $ 12.4 Retiree Health Care Plan 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Interest cost $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.3 $ 0.4 Prior service credit ( 0.1 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 0.6 ) Total benefit credit $ — $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.2 ) $ ( 0.2 ) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, contributions made to our pension plans were $ 5.3 and $ 16.3 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 and $ 0.9 , respectively. During 2020, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 17.6 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. 18 Pension Settlement During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement will be utilized to fund future qualified 401(k) plan contributions following the conclusion of the standard PBGC audit. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: September 30, December 31, 2020 2019 Foreign currency translation $ ( 231.4 ) $ ( 260.5 ) Translation (loss) gain on derivative instruments, net of income taxes of $( 21.6 ) and $( 9.1 ), respectively ( 10.7 ) 13.1 Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 127.7 ) ( 121.5 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $( 35.2 ) and $( 30.9 ), respectively ( 64.6 ) ( 74.1 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 2.2 and $ 1.6 , respectively 1.6 2.0 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 432.8 ) $ ( 441.0 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 0.1 and $ 0.2 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and income of $ 0.9 and an expense of $ 1.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.09 per share on both May 8, 2020 and May 10, 2019 . The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020 . The 2019 dividends were paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019 . Share Repurchases In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first nine months of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 63.8 . The repurchases in the first nine months of 2020 all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. During the first nine months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.8 million shares at a cost of $ 152.0 under the 2018 authorization. As of September 30, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. 19 (12) Interest and Other Expenses (Income), Net Interest and other expenses (income), net consisted of the following: 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 10.8 $ 11.9 $ 32.3 $ 33.3 Interest income ( 3.1 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 9.9 ) ( 3.2 ) Foreign exchange loss 0.6 4.1 4.2 6.5 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 2.3 ) ( 3.2 ) 5.7 ( 82.7 ) Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 6.0 $ 12.2 $ 32.3 $ ( 46.1 ) (1) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 includes a $ 10.2 pension settlement loss related to one of our United States plans.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 467.8 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 581.8 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of September 30, 2020. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2020 2019 2020 2019 Euro Notes $ ( 43.8 ) $ 42.6 $ ( 45.7 ) $ 51.1 Cross-currency swaps ( 11.3 ) 2.8 ( 8.9 ) 2.8 20 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019 we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019: (Loss) Gain Reclassified (Loss) Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 3 Months Ended September 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified 3 Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2020 2019 from AOCI into Income 2020 2019 Cross-currency swaps $ ( 3.2 ) $ 4.2 Interest and other expenses (income), net $ ( 3.3 ) $ 4.6 (Loss) Gain Reclassified (Loss) Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 9 Months Ended September 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified 9 Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2020 2019 from AOCI into Income 2020 2019 Cross-currency swaps $ 1.6 $ 9.2 Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 1.4 $ 10.0 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at September 30, 2020 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-designated instruments 21 We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ — $ 4.6 $ 0.3 $ 13.8 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Assets September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 12.0 $ 9.7 Total instruments $ 12.0 $ 9.7 Liabilities September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,049.6 $ 1,002.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 16.1 6.0 Total instruments $ 1,065.7 $ 1,008.9 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,092.8 and $ 1,062.5 as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,049.6 and $ 1,002.9 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 109.7 and $ 107.3 as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Operating lease expense $ 37.4 $ 36.4 $ 109.0 $ 106.1 Short-term lease expense 1.8 3.5 9.0 15.6 Other lease expense (1) $ 3.9 $ 2.6 $ 12.4 $ 12.5 Total lease expense $ 43.1 $ 42.5 $ 130.4 $ 134.2 (1) Other lease expense includes variable lease expense and sublease income. 22 Other information related to leases was as follows: 9 Months Ended September 30, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2020 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 107.9 $ 109.7 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 56.1 88.8 September 30, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2020 2019 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 407.9 $ 448.5 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 115.2 $ 122.1 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 318.8 336.7 Total operating lease liabilities $ 434.0 $ 458.8 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, outplacement services, talent management services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to 23 a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 578.8 $ 666.4 $ 1,705.6 $ 1,942.3 Other Americas 350.3 428.1 1,071.1 1,250.6 929.1 1,094.5 2,776.7 3,192.9 Southern Europe: France 1,205.3 1,386.4 3,035.1 4,117.8 Italy 351.2 376.9 947.4 1,127.7 Other Southern Europe 555.9 594.5 1,545.4 1,615.4 2,112.4 2,357.8 5,527.9 6,860.9 Northern Europe 947.7 1,166.8 2,881.9 3,561.4 APME 595.6 629.8 1,759.6 2,051.7 Consolidated (b) $ 4,584.8 $ 5,248.9 $ 12,946.1 $ 15,666.9 Operating unit profit (loss): (c) Americas: United States $ 19.3 $ 39.8 $ 30.8 94.1 Other Americas 12.2 19.5 37.0 52.5 31.5 59.3 67.8 146.6 Southern Europe: France 51.5 70.3 87.0 201.3 Italy 15.4 23.3 40.6 73.4 Other Southern Europe 4.7 22.8 9.1 51.9 71.6 116.4 136.7 326.6 Northern Europe ( 22.5 ) 22.8 ( 36.3 ) 50.3 APME 16.7 54.9 51.6 105.2 97.3 253.4 219.8 628.7 Corporate expenses ( 29.1 ) ( 29.2 ) ( 83.5 ) ( 89.0 ) Goodwill impairment charges - - ( 66.8 ) ( 64.0 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 6.6 ) ( 7.2 ) ( 20.2 ) ( 22.4 ) Operating profit 61.6 217.0 49.3 453.3 Interest and other (expenses) income, net ( 6.0 ) ( 12.2 ) ( 32.3 ) 46.1 Earnings before income taxes $ 55.6 $ 204.8 $ 17.0 $ 499.4 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.4 and $ 3.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 8.8 and $ 10.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 116.9 and $ 151.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 315.7 and $ 462.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 3.8 and $ 4.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 9.9 and $ 14.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 236.9 and $ 274.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 447.3 and $ 680.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 24 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on pages 37-38 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency.

Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the third quarter of 2020 when compared to the prior year, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. Our third quarter results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, with revenues declining 12.7% during the quarter. The pandemic reduced demand for our services across almost all of our operations. We believe we have seen some signs of a global recovery as the third quarter progressed with our results reflecting a stronger market environment. At the beginning of the quarter, it appeared the impact of the COVID-19 crisis was stabilizing in many parts of the world, and economies slowly reopened. However, as the quarter came to a close a number of countries started to see increased cases of COVID-19 that are leading to the implementation of new restrictions in an effort to mitigate the spread. Unlike the lockdowns and restrictions experienced earlier in the year, we do not anticipate the same country-wide lockdowns, but more targeted and localized restrictions. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. The ultimate impact may depend on multiple factors which cannot be predicted, including public health conditions and the possibility of local and national governments enforcing new restrictions on commerce, which could have an adverse impact on our business, or, conversely the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus packages, which could be beneficial. What started as a sudden and swift slowdown of the global economies and labor markets is expected to take longer to recover around the world than we had initially contemplated. We currently anticipate a two-tiered recovery with certain industries recovering quicker in the near term and other industries continuing to be impacted in the medium- to long-term. In addition to the impact from COVID-19 discussed above, results for the quarter were impacted by currency. During the third quarter of 2020, the United States dollar was weaker, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets, except in Other Americas, which therefore had a favorable impact on our reported results and generally may overstate the performance of our underlying 25 business . The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 1.8 % favorable impact on revenues from services and no impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, our businesses experienced improvement in year-over-year revenue trends from the second quarter reflecting a stronger market environment and early signs of a global recovery. Our consolidated revenues were down 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency in the quarter, an improvement from the 28.0% year-over-year constant currency decrease in the second quarter of 2020. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency revenue year-over-year decrease was 14.9% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a 26.6% decrease in the second quarter of 2020. Although the most dramatic revenue declines occurred in the second quarter, as European governments imposed states of emergency and related lockdowns, we continued to experience revenue declines during the third quarter on a year-over-year basis as regional economies remained at reduced activity levels as a result of COVID-19. We experienced a gradual improvement in the rates of decline throughout the third quarter of 2020 with monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 18% in July, 16% in August, and 9% in September. The progressive improvement in the rate of year-over-year revenue decline during the quarter reflects the continued increase in activity levels since the reopening of economies largely in May as governments in some of our largest countries lifted lock-down requirements. We experienced a 25.1% decrease (-26.9% in constant currency and -27.0% in organic constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. On an overall basis, our Talent Solutions business, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, experienced a decline in the quarter, which was driven by RPO activity. We experienced a sharp reduction in RPO activity as many client programs continued their hiring freezes initiated in the second quarter due to the COVID-19 crisis, although we did see improvement in the rate of year-over-year revenue decline from the second quarter. Our MSP business has been resilient during the crisis and experienced growth during the quarter as we assisted more clients to develop customized workforce solutions during the economic downturn. Our Right Management business experienced growth during the quarter driven by the increase demand for our career transition services. During the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, most of our markets experienced revenue declines due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a revenue decrease in Southern Europe, mainly driven by revenue declines in France and Italy due to the continued impact from the crisis. We experienced a revenue decrease in Northern Europe due to the declines in all of our key markets as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency decrease in the Americas was 13.0% driven by a decrease in the United States related to the COVID-19 crisis. After adjusting for billing days, revenues in constant currency decreased 5.4% in APME due to the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in Japan due to an increase in demand for our staffing/interim revenues. Our gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 decreased due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and the margin decrease in our Proservia managed services business. The decrease was also due the decline in our staffing/interim margins in the Americas and Northern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business. The overall gross margin decrease was partially offset by the growth in our higher-margin career transition services within our Right Management business and increases in staffing/interim margins in Southern Europe due to the favorable impact of a direct cost accrual adjustment in France related to a payroll tax audit recorded in the third quarter of 2020 and in APME primarily due to the improvement in Japan. We recorded $49.9 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2020, comprised of $16.7 million in the Americas, $7.6 million in Southern Europe, $24.1 million in Northern Europe, and $1.5 million in APME. The restructuring costs were primarily related to real estate optimization and streamlining our operations. We expect to recover the restructuring costs through cost savings over the next 12 months with full run-rate savings beginning in the first quarter of 2021. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. 26 Our operating profit decreased 71.6 % in the third quarter of 2020 ( -71.6% in constant currency; -71.9% in organic constant currency) while our operating profit margin decreased 280 basis points compared to the third quarter of 20 19 . Excluding the restructuring costs , the loss of $5.8 million from the disposition of our Serbia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Croatia businesses incurred in the third quarter of 2020 and the $30.4 million gain related to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited (“Deconsolidation”) in the third quarter of 2019, our operating profit was down 38.4 % in constant currency while operating profit margin was down 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating profit margin reflects the material deleveraging that accompanied the decrease in revenues from the sustained impact of the COVID-19 crisis . We took significant actions in late March and early April, which allowed us to reduce selling and administrative expenses in our business. These reductions remained in place during the third quarter of 2020, which partially offset the revenue and gross profit declines during the third quarter. This included leveraging government unemployment related benefits, which allowed us to move unutilized staff and associates quickly onto these programs, with most of the benefits from these actions occurring in the second quarter. There were a few programs still in place, mostly in Germany and the Netherlands, in the third quarter from which we were still benefitting. This also included the short-term action of cutting discretionary costs and scaling operations back. In addition to these implemented initiatives, we are prepared to take further cost actions to optimize our business structure through this economic downturn with the intention of simultaneously preserving our ability to rebound when market conditions improve. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. As we manage through this crisis and prepare our business for future opportunities we would also like to emphasize the following points: • Many of our leaders have experience managing through economic downturns, and many of our senior operational leaders previously managed parts of our business during the economic downturn in 2008-2009. We believe this is valuable experience for the current economic environment. Additionally, we have enhanced our enterprise risk management framework in recent years, and we have business continuity plans which have been executed at a global, regional and country level. • The technology investments we have been making for the last few years as part of our transformational activities have facilitated a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis. As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately [90%] of our full-time equivalent employees working remotely while mitigating potential productivity losses. We have also extended our cyber and information security capability to accelerate the ability for some of our associates and consultants to work for our clients at home mitigating potential operational or financial losses. Expectations of when our full-time equivalent employees return to the workplace will depend on a number of factors including the impact such a return would have on the safety, health and well-being of our employees as well as the impact from any government mandates or restrictions. • Our business has benefitted from our diversification across geographies, industries, and offerings, that we believe position us well to endure the COVID-19 crisis. We believe this diversification may likewise position us to take advantage of market opportunities that present themselves. For example, during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, we have seen smaller declines within our Experis business compared to the Manpower business, and we are positioned with a large portion of our business focused on providing professional services and Talent Solutions. We believe our strategy to improve the diversification of our business through the growth of Experis will facilitate growth following the crisis as companies accelerate technology investments. Additionally, portions of our Talent Solutions business are assisting our clients through this downturn with customized solutions. Right Management has experienced increased demand for career transition services and has historically been a counter-cyclical business that helps offset the impact of an economic downturn. 27 Operating Results - Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to 2019. (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 4,584.8 $ 5,248.9 (12.7 )% (14.5 )% Cost of services 3,859.7 4,408.6 (12.5 )% (14.3 )% Gross profit 725.1 840.3 (13.7 )% (15.4 )% Gross profit margin 15.8 % 16.0 % Selling and administrative expenses 663.5 623.3 6.5 % 4.1 % Operating profit 61.6 217.0 (71.6 )% (71.6 )% Operating profit margin 1.3 % 4.1 % Interest and other expenses, net 6.0 12.2 (51.4 )% Earnings before income taxes 55.6 204.8 (72.8 )% (72.7 )% Provision for income taxes 45.3 58.7 (22.8 )% Effective income tax rate 81.5 % 28.6 % Net earnings $ 10.3 $ 146.1 (93.0 )% (92.9 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 0.18 $ 2.42 (92.6 )% (92.6 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 58.5 60.3 (3.0 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 12.7% (-14.5% in constant currency and -14.7% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 10.4% (-14.7% in constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 13.1% (-17.3% in constant currency), which was primarily due to a decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 17.5% decrease (-21.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease also includes a decrease in Italy of 6.8% (-11.3% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 26.1% decrease (-29.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one more billing day; • decreased demand for services in most of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 18.8% (-21.6% in constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 32.9% decrease (-35.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 18.3%, 28.0%, 13.2%, 18.6% and 25.3%, respectively (-22.0%, -31.5%, -15.1%, -22.6%, and -29.1%, respectively, in constant currency); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 13.1% (-15.2% on an organic basis) primarily driven by decreased demand for our staffing/interim services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 14.8% (-15.2% on an organic basis), both due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by increased demand for our MSP offering and career transition services; and • a revenue decrease in APME of 5.4% (-6.0% in constant currency) due to the decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 15.8% (-18.2% in constant currency), partially offset by an increase in revenues in Japan and an increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within the Manpower business; partially offset by • a 1.8% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 20 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 25.1% (-26.9% in constant currency and -27.0% in organic constant currency); 28 • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from declines in the staffing/interim margins in the Americas and Northern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business ; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the decrease in margin in our Proservia business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany; partially offset by • a 20 basis point favorable impact from the growth in our higher-margin career transition services within our Right Management business; and • a 20 basis point favorable impact from staffing/interim margin increases in the Southern Europe due to the favorable impact of a direct cost accrual adjustment in France related to a payroll tax audit recorded in the third quarter of 2020 and APME primarily due to the improvement in Japan. The 6.5% increase in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2020 (4.1% in constant currency; 3.9% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • restructuring costs of $49.9 million incurred in the third quarter of 2020; • the $30.4 million gain related to the Deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2019; • the $5.8 million loss on the disposition of subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2020; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $1.5 million incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019; and • a 2.4% increase due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 6.4% decrease (-8.3% in constant currency and -8.6% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs due to a reduction of salary-related costs as a result of lower headcount and a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets; and • an 8.2% decrease (-10.2% in constant currency and -10.3% in organic constant currency) in non-personnel related costs, excluding restructuring costs, loss from the disposition of subsidiaries and gain related to the Deconsolidation, due to cost management actions taken across all segments as a result of revenue declines. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 260 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 due primarily to: • a 110 basis point unfavorable impact from restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2020; • a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from expense deleveraging, excluding restructuring costs, the loss on the disposition of subsidiaries and the gain related to the Deconsolidation, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline; • a 60 basis point unfavorable impact from the gain related to the Deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2019; • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the loss on disposition of subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2020; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses, net was $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $12.2 million in the third quarter of 2019. Net interest expense decreased $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $7.7 million from $11.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 primarily due to an increase interest income as a result of higher cash balances. Miscellaneous income was $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2019. 29 We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 81.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 28.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, including the recognition of a discrete valuation allowance in Germany, and the French business tax. The French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in the quarter due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. The effective tax rate of 81.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was significantly higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the factors noted above. The COVID-19 crisis has created uncertainty in predicting future earnings before income taxes and its impact to the third quarter of 2020 along with quarterly effective tax rates for future quarters may be material. Net earnings per share - diluted was $0.18 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $2.42 in the third quarter of 2019. Restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.72 in the third quarter of 2020. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.09 in the third quarter of 2020. The gain from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited IPO recorded in the third quarter of 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.50 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 58.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 from 60.3 million in the third quarter of 2019. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the third quarter of 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the third quarter of 2019. Operating Results – Nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 12,946.1 $ 15,666.9 (17.4 )% (16.4 )% Cost of services 10,920.3 13,151.4 (17.0 )% (15.9 )% Gross profit 2,025.8 2,515.5 (19.5 )% (18.6 )% Gross profit margin 15.6 % 16.1 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 1,909.7 1,998.2 (4.4 )% (3.6 )% Goodwill impairment charges 66.8 64.0 4.2 % 4.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 1,976.5 2,062.2 (4.2 )% (3.3 )% Operating profit 49.3 453.3 (89.1 )% (88.4 )% Operating profit margin 0.4 % 2.9 % Interest and other expenses (income), net 32.3 (46.1 ) N/A Earnings before income taxes 17.0 499.4 (96.6 )% (96.0 )% Provision for income taxes 69.4 172.5 (59.8 )% Effective income tax rate 407.4 % 34.5 % Net (loss) earnings $ (52.4 ) $ 326.9 N/A N/A Net (loss) earnings per share – diluted $ (0.90 ) $ 5.40 N/A N/A Weighted average shares – diluted 58.4 60.6 (3.6 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 17.4% (-16.4% in constant currency and -16.0% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 19.4% (-19.9% in constant currency; -21.2% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 26.3% (-26.6% in constant currency), which was primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower staffing services and a 25.5% decrease (-25.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease also includes a decrease in Italy of 16.0% (-16.2% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 34.2% decrease (-34.0% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis; 30 • decreased demand for services in most of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 19.1 % (- 17.9 % in constant currency; - 17.7 % in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 32.1 % decrease (- 31.3 % in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 14.9 %, 26.1 %, 19.1 %, 21.9 % and 27.7 % , respectively (- 14.7 %, - 26.0 %, - 15.3 %, - 21.9 %, and - 27.8 %, respectively, in constant currency); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 12.2% (-14.5% on an organic basis) primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 13.8% (-14.3% on an organic basis) decrease in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in our Talent Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering and career transition services; • a revenue decrease in APME of 14.2% (-13.3% in constant currency; -2.8% in organic constant currency) due to the Deconsolidation, partially offset by an increase in revenues in Japan and an increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within the Manpower business; and • a 1.0% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 50 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 28.1% (-27.2% in constant currency and -23.9% in organic constant currency); • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact due to the margin decrease in our Proservia business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from a deterioration in our staffing/interim margin in the Americas, Southern Europe, and Northern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business and higher rates of sickness and absenteeism in certain countries and increased direct costs associated with early termination of client contracts during the COVID-19 crisis. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by reduced direct costs in certain countries due to government crisis response programs, a direct cost accrual adjustment in France related to a payroll tax audit recorded in the first nine months of 2020, our execution of various bill/pay yield initiatives due to the COVID-19 crisis; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact by growth in our higher-margin MSP offering and career transition services. The 4.2% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (-3.3% in constant currency; -2.4% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 10.7% decrease (-9.8% in constant currency and -8.8% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs due to a reduction of salary-related costs as a result of lower headcount and a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs that mostly occurred in the second quarter of 2020; • a 6.7% decrease (-5.8% in constant currency and -5.0% in organic constant currency) in non-personnel related costs, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, restructuring costs, loss on disposition of subsidiaries, and gain related to Deconsolidation, due to cost management actions taken across all segments as a result of revenue declines; • the reduction in recurring selling and administrative costs of $36.5 million as a result of the Deconsolidation in July 2019; and • a 0.9% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • an increase in restructuring costs to $98.1 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from $39.8 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2019; • the $30.4 million gain related to the Deconsolidation in the nine months ended September 30, 2019; 31 • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $17.9 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe and franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019; • the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges to $72.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from $65.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019; and • the $5.8 million loss on the disposition of subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 210 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the first nine months of 2019 due primarily to: • a 120 basis point unfavorable impact from expense deleveraging, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, restructuring costs, loss on disposition of subsidiaries, and gain related to Deconsolidation, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline; • a 50 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019; • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from the gain related to the Deconsolidation in the nine months ended September 30, 2019; • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Interest and other expenses (income), net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses (income), net was expense of $32.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to income of $46.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Net interest expense decreased $7.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $22.4 million from $30.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher cash balances. Miscellaneous expense (income), net was an expense $5.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to income of $82.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The change is primarily due to the $80.4 million from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the pension settlement expense of $10.2 million recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the decrease in noncontrolling interest expense as a result of a decrease in earnings in a joint venture in Germany. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 407.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 34.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, including the recognition of a discrete valuation allowance in Germany, the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge in Germany, and the French business tax. The effective tax rate of 407.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was significantly higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the factors noted above. Net (loss) earnings per share - diluted was a loss of $0.90 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to earnings of $5.40 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net (loss) earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.01 per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Restructuring costs recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net (loss) earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.40 and $0.52 per share, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.14 and $1.08 per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pension settlement expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share – diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.09, net of tax, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.33 per share in the nine months ended 32 September 30, 2019 . The gain from the D econsolidation recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.50 per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 58.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 60.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since September 30, 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since September 30, 2019. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 15.1% (-11.2% in constant currency; -12.5% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 13.1% (-15.2% on an organic basis) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by decreased demand for our staffing/interim services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 14.8% (-15.2% on an organic basis), both due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. These decreases in the United States were partially offset by increased demand for our MSP offering as well as increased demand for career transition services, within our Right Management business. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 18.2% (-8.2% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. This decline was driven by decreases in Mexico, Canada, Peru, Colombia and Brazil of 20.0%, 11.2%, 25.1%, 42.8%, and 12.2%, respectively (-9.1%, -10.4%, -20.6%, -36.1% and increase of 18.9%, respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were offset by an increase in Argentina of 7.9% (58.1% in constant currency) primarily due to inflation. In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 13.0% (-9.0% in constant currency, -10.4% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 12.2% (-14.5% on an organic basis) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 13.8% (-14.3% on an organic basis), both due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. These decreases in the United States were partially offset by increased demand for our MSP offering and career transition services. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 14.4% (-4.2% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. This decline was driven by decreases in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Brazil of 16.6%, 4.4%, 2.9%, 16.3%, 34.0% and 21.5%, respectively (-6.6%, -2.7%, increase of 48.5%, -13.2%, -24.9% and increase of 1.9%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. Gross profit margin increased in both the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to gross profit margin increases in the United States from the increase in revenues from our higher-margin career transition services and MSP offering. This increase was partially offset by the decreases in our permanent recruitment business of 20.0% and 17.6%, respectively (-18.6% and -16.2%, respectively, in constant currency) and declines in the staffing/interim margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues came from our lower margin enterprise clients. In the third quarter of 2020, selling and administrative expenses increased 0.8% (3.4% in constant currency and 2.5% in organic constant currency), primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs to $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2019 and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in salary-related costs, because of lower headcount, and discretionary expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.3% (3.0% in constant currency and 1.9% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs to $29.5 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $9.8 million in the first nine months of 2019, the impairment charge of $6.0 million recorded in the United States related to capitalized software in the first nine months of 2020, a bad debt expense and a state sales tax related charge incurred in the first nine months of 2020, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States. These increases were partially offset by decreases in salary-related costs, due to lower headcount, and discretionary expenses. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 3.4% and 5.4% for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 3.3% in the third quarter of 2020 from 6.0% in 2019 primarily due to the increase in 33 restructuring costs and expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease expenses at the same rate as the accelerated revenue decline due to the COVID-19 crisis , partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.5% in the third quarter of 2020 from 4.6% in the third quarter of 2019 due primarily to the decrease in the gross profit margin, increase in restructuring costs and expense deleveraging. OUP margin in the Americas was 2.4% and 4.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 4.8% in 2019 primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs, the software impairment charge and expense deleveraging. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 4.2% in 2019 primarily due to a decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased 10.4% (-14.7% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In the third quarter of 2020, revenues from services decreased 13.1% (-17.3% in constant currency) in France (which represents 57% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 6.8% (-11.3% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 17% of Southern Europe’s revenues), with both experiencing improvement in the rate of revenue decline as the third quarter progressed. The decrease in France is primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 17.5% decrease (-21.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment busines s, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 26.1% decrease (-29.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one more billing day. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 6.5% (-10.7% in constant currency) during the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 43.2% (-45.0% in constant currency), both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues from services decreased 19.4% (-19.9% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenues from services decreased 26.3% (-26.6% in constant currency) in France and decreased 16.0% (-16.2% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 25.5% (-25.4% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 34.2% (-34.0% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 4.3% (-5.3% in constant currency) during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 33.7% (-33.7% in constant currency), both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Gross profit margin decreased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decrease of 30.5% (-33.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the increase in the staffing/interim gross profit margin due to a direct cost accrual adjustment in France related to a payroll tax audit recorded in the third quarter of 2020. Gross profit margin decreased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decrease of 30.9% (-30.8% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and a decrease in the staffing/interim gross profit margin in France, Italy and certain countries within Other Southern Europe, partially offset by a direct cost accrual adjustment in France recorded in the first nine months of 2020. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.0% (decrease -2.9% in constant currency) during the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs to $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2019, the loss of $5.8 million from the disposition of our Serbia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Croatia businesses, and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of our discretionary expenses, a decrease in personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, and a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 5.7% (-6.2% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. We took significant actions in France and Italy in March and April to reduce our costs to help offset the materially reduced revenues in the first nine months of 2020. In both France and Italy, we transitioned full-time equivalent employees onto 34 government temporary unemployment programs and other initiatives and eliminated a significant amount of discretionary spend to manage through the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2020 was primarily due to the decreases in personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets , and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in certain markets that mostly occurred in the second quarter of 2020 . The decreases are also due to the reduction of our discretionary expenses. These decreases were offset by the increase in restructuring costs to $ 20.7 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $ 5.4 million in the first nine months of 2019 , the loss on the disposition of subsidiaries and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 3.4% for the third quarter of 2020 compared to 4.9% for 2019. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 4.3% for the third quarter of 2020 from 5.1% in 2019 primarily due to expense deleveraging partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 4.4% for the third quarter of 2020 from 6.2% for 2019 primarily due to the decline in the gross profit margin, the increase in restructuring costs to $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2019 and expense deleveraging. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 0.9% for the third quarter of 2020 from 3.9% in 2019, due to the increase in restructuring costs to $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to zero in the third quarter of 2019, the loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2020, decrease in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 2.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 4.8% in 2019. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 2.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 4.9% in 2019. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 4.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 6.5% in 2019. The decreases in France and Italy were primarily due to the decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 0.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 3.2% in 2019, due to the decrease in the gross profit margin, the increase in restructuring costs to $17.3 million in the first nine months of 2020 from $3.1 million in the first nine months of 2019, the loss from the disposition of subsidiaries in the first nine months of 2020 and expense deleveraging. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 34%, 16%, 21%, 12%, and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 18.8% (-21.6% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 18.3%, 28.0%, 13.2%, 18.6% and 25.3% (-22.0%, -31.5%, -15.1%, -22.6% and -29.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 32.9% decrease (-35.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues from services decreased 19.1% (-17.9% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 14.9%, 26.1%, 19.1%, 21.9% and 27.7% (-14.7%, -26.0%, -15.3%, -21.9% and -27.8%, respectively, in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 32.1% decrease (-31.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Gross profit margin decreased in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decreases in our permanent recruitment business for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019, and the declines in the Experis interim margins due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues consisted of revenues from our lower-margin enterprise clients, and the margin decrease in our Proservia business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.2% (decrease of -3.2% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs to $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 from zero in the third quarter of 2019 and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in discretionary expenses and personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in variable incentive costs due to declines in profitability in most markets, and the continued benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in Germany and the Netherlands. 35 Selling and administrative expenses decreased 9.7% (-8.9% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decrease in personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in variable incentive costs due to decline s in profitability in most markets , and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in certain markets, mostly in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease is also due to the decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices, and a reduction of our discretionary expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increase of restructuring costs to $43.5 million in the first nine months of 2020 from $18.7 million in the first nine months of 2019 and the increase in the goodwill impairment charge in Germany of $66.8 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $60.2 million in the first nine months of 2019. Northern Europe experienced a decrease to an operating unit loss of 2.4% in the third quarter of 2020 from an OUP margin of 2.0% in the third quarter of 2019 and a decrease to an operating unit loss of 1.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from an OUP margin of 1.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decreases were primarily due to the declines in the gross profit margins, the increase in restructuring costs, and expense deleveraging. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was also due increase in the goodwill impairment charge in Germany. APME Revenues from services decreased 5.4% (-6.0% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In Japan (which represents 45% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 5.7% (4.5% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, partially offset by a 13.0% decrease (-14.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. In Australia (which represents 17% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 4.5% (-8.4% in constant currency) due to the decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the 5.0% (-8.8% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business. Revenues from services decreased 14.2% (-13.3% in constant currency and -2.8% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019. In Japan, revenues from services increased 8.8% (7.2% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our Talent Solutions business and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing days in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were partially offset by a 5.1% decrease (-6.5% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia, revenues from services decreased 20.3% (-17.6% in constant currency) due to the decrease in our staffing/interim revenues, as a result of our decision to exit certain businesses with low-margins to improve profitability and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the 8.7% (-5.6% in constant currency) decline in our permanent recruitment business and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the Deconsolidation, and the decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by the increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business. Gross profit margin increased in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 due to the increase in our staffing/interim margin, mostly in Japan, partially offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 15.8% (-18.2% in constant currency). Gross profit margin decreased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 30.3% (-28.8% in constant currency and -11.6% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the increase in our staffing/interim margin, mostly in Japan. Selling and administrative expenses increased 82.3% (79.4% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the gain of $30.4 million from the Deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2019, an increase in costs to support the increase in revenues in certain markets, and the increase of restructuring costs to $1.5 in the third quarter of 2020 from zero in the third quarter of 2019. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.5% (3.5% in constant currency and 22.9% in organic constant currency) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the gain from the Deconsolidation in the first nine months of 2019 and an increase in costs to support the increase in revenues in certain markets. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of 36 recurring selling and administrative costs as a result of the Deconsolidation and the decrease of restructuring costs to $4.1 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $4.4 million in the first nine months of 2019. OUP margin for APME decreased to 2.8% in the third quarter of 2020 from 8.7% in the third quarter of 2019 due to the gain from the Deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2019, an increase in restructuring costs and expense deleveraging, partially offset by an increase in the gross profit margin. OUP margin decreased to 2.9% in the first nine months of 2020 from 5.1% in the first nine months of 2019 due to the gain from the Deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2019, a decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. 37 Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: 3 Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to 2019 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States 578.8 (13.1 )% — (13.1 )% 2.1 % (15.2 )% Other Americas 350.3 (18.2 )% (10.0 )% (8.2 )% — (8.2 )% 929.1 (15.1 )% (3.9 )% (11.2 )% 1.3 % (12.5 )% Southern Europe: France 1,205.3 (13.1 )% 4.2 % (17.3 )% — (17.3 )% Italy 351.2 (6.8 )% 4.5 % (11.3 )% — (11.3 )% Other Southern Europe 555.9 (6.5 )% 4.2 % (10.7 )% — (10.7 )% 2,112.4 (10.4 )% 4.3 % (14.7 )% — (14.7 )% Northern Europe 947.7 (18.8 )% 2.8 % (21.6 )% — (21.6 )% APME 595.6 (5.4 )% 0.6 % (6.0 )% — (6.0 )% Consolidated 4,584.8 (12.7 )% 1.8 % (14.5 )% 0.2 % (14.7 )% Gross Profit 725.1 (13.7 )% 1.7 % (15.4 )% 0.3 % (15.7 )% Selling and Administrative Expenses 663.5 6.5 % 2.4 % 4.1 % 0.2 % 3.9 % Operating Profit 61.6 (71.6 )% — (71.6 )% 0.3 % (71.9 )% (a) In millions for the three months ended September 30, 2020. 9 Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to 2019 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States $ 1,705.6 (12.2 )% — (12.2 )% 2.3 % (14.5 )% Other Americas 1,071.1 (14.4 )% (10.2 )% (4.2 )% — (4.2 )% 2,776.7 (13.0 )% (4.0 )% (9.0 )% 1.4 % (10.4 )% Southern Europe: France 3,035.1 (26.3 )% 0.3 % (26.6 )% — (26.6 )% Italy 947.4 (16.0 )% 0.2 % (16.2 )% — (16.2 )% Other Southern Europe 1,545.4 (4.3 )% 1.0 % (5.3 )% 5.7 % (11.0 )% 5,527.9 (19.4 )% 0.5 % (19.9 )% 1.3 % (21.2 )% Northern Europe 2,881.9 (19.1 )% (1.2 )% (17.9 )% (0.2 )% (17.7 )% APME 1,759.6 (14.2 )% (0.9 )% (13.3 )% (10.5 )% (2.8 )% Consolidated $ 12,946.1 (17.4 )% (1.0 )% (16.4 )% (0.4 )% (16.0 )% Gross Profit $ 2,025.8 (19.5 )% (0.9 )% (18.6 )% (0.7 )% (17.9 )% Selling and Administrative Expenses $ 1,976.5 (4.2 )% (0.9 )% (3.3 )% (0.9 )% (2.4 )% Operating Profit $ 49.3 (89.1 )% (0.7 )% (88.4 )% 0.4 % (88.8 )% (a) In millions for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of September 30, 2020, we had $1,300 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 38 December 2017, we no longer record United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $715.7 million and $495.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $599.7 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $114.7 million of cash generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These changes were primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable, due to collections and the receivables not being replaced at the same level as a result of a decrease in demand for our services, and the benefit of certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis. These improvements in our cash flows were partially offset by the decrease in our payroll-related liabilities due to lower activity. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,535.7 million as of September 30, 2020 from $5,273.1 million as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to successful collection efforts and the revenue decline, partially offset by the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") decreased by approximately 1.0 day from December 31, 2019 due to successful collection efforts and favorable mix changes, as a higher percentage of our consolidated revenues were generated in countries with a lower average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with an average days sales outstanding of between 55 and 60 days based on the markets where we do business. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, as we saw starting in late March and continuing through the third quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. During the third quarter of 2020, we were highly successful in receivable collections while incurring lower payroll costs on lower activity. Our improved cash flow also benefited from certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis, with some of the benefits maturing in the third quarter. The impact of the remaining benefits is expected to mature in the last quarter of the 2020 and first quarter of 2021 and we expect lower levels of operating cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures were $30.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The lower expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019 are primarily due to overall scale-back of activities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis and the completion of a software development project in 2019, as well as the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $1.7 million, which represents a deferred consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. On September 30, 2020 we disposed of four businesses (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria) in our Southern Europe segment for $5.8 million, subject to normal post close working capital adjustments, and simultaneously entered into franchise agreements with the new ownership of these businesses. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time loss on disposition of $5.8 million, which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in 39 Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $212.7 million as of September 30 , 2019 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $154.4 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The total cash impact of the acquisition was an inflow of $104.8 million , net of cash acquired of $317.5 million . The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million , $32.5 million represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. Excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This balance represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $12.9 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25% of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25%, and then further diluted to 36.87% as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for the remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time cash gain of $30.4, which was included in the selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Included in the $30.4 was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $6.2 related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive income. Net debt repayments were $28.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to cash provided by net borrowings of $6.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of September 30, 2020, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of September 30, 2020. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of (0.24) to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.33 to 1 as of September 30, 2020. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of September 30, 2020 and for the near future. As of September 30, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,587.7 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600 million of additional cash, which remains unused as of September 30, 2020, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300 million ($600 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $262.0 million was available to use as of September 30, 2020. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,049.6 million as of September 30, 2020 mature in 2022 and 2026, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital 40 resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.09 per share on both May 8, 2020 and May 10, 2019. The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020. The 2019 dividends were paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first nine months of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $63.8 million. The repurchases in the first nine months of 2020 all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. During the first nine months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.8 million shares at a cost of $152.0 million under the 2018 authorization. As of September 30, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,139.3 million as of September 30, 2020 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,202.8 million as of December 31, 2019. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling approximately $941.7 million and $845.0 million as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively ($890.1 million and $793.4 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both dates). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.4 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recorded net restructuring costs of $98.1 million and $42.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $22.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $55.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We expect a majority of the remaining $49.9 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. Application of Critical Accounting Policies In accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below carrying value. Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be a component of the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2020 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. 41 We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. For the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included sustained operating losses resulted from the ongoing decline and increased uncertainty in the outlook of the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector in Germany, coupled with the significant implications of COVID-19. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $66.8, which resulted in full impairment of the remaining goodwill in the Germany reporting unit. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value for our Germany reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test and our quarterly assessments in the intervening periods due to the factors discussed above. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2020 and there was no impairment of our goodwill as a result of our annual tests. Refer to Note 1 for results of our annual goodwill impairment testing. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. Our business, operations and consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. By the end of March, significant lockdown measures had been implemented in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. As the second quarter of 2020 drew to a close, indications were that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis had been contained in many parts of the world, and economies had begun to slowly reopen. However, some countries in Latin America and parts of the United States continue to deal with the COVID-19 crisis at elevated levels. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. We are continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations will continue to be adversely affected. However, we cannot predict with certainty what the impact will be on future periods. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, age of receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 113.5 Provisions charged to earnings 10.8 Write-offs ( 9.6 ) Translation adjustments ( 0.8 ) Reclassifications and other 3.8 Balance, June 30, 2020 $ 117.7 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 8 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization , lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payroll Tax Credit In April 2019, we sold a portion of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ). We derecognized these receivables and the additional interest upon the sale date as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment in accordance with the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote down the carrying value of the Germany reporting unit to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $ 60.2 during the second quarter of 2019. As of the date of our last annual impairment test, performed during the third quarter of 2019, the fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Germany reporting unit. For the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included sustained operating losses resulted from the ongoing decline and increased uncertainty in the outlook of the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector in Germany, coupled with the significant implications of COVID-19. Our German business has not experienced the improvement in the rate of revenue decline as the second quarter progressed that many of our other European markets have experienced, and if we continue to experience sustained revenue declines and operating losses we may have to consider further actions to optimize our business structure. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2020. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 66.8 . The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value for our Germany reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test and our quarterly assessments in the intervening periods due to the factors discussed above. 9 W e determined the fair value of the Germany reporting unit by utilizing an income approach derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. The income approach is developed from management’s forecasted cash flow data. Significant assumptions used in our interim goodwill impairment test included: future expected revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rate, and a terminal value multiple. We have also experienced declines in the operating results of our reporting units apart from our Germany reporting unit during the six months ended June 30, 2020 as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy; however, as of the end of the first half of 2020 and the date of this filing, we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are below their carrying value. However, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2020 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the previous methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable that loss has been incurred. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. 10 We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to June 30, 2020 , related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 37.3 at June 30, 2020 and $ 44.5 at December 31, 2019. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types. 3 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 429.0 $ 30.5 $ 15.8 $ 40.6 $ 515.9 $ 551.3 $ 38.4 $ 24.1 $ 38.9 $ 652.7 Other Americas 307.2 7.3 3.1 3.1 320.7 392.8 13.3 6.2 3.2 415.5 736.2 37.8 18.9 43.7 836.6 944.1 51.7 30.3 42.1 1,068.2 Southern Europe: France 663.4 62.5 7.4 2.7 736.0 1,345.7 58.4 13.6 7.6 1,425.3 Italy 255.0 5.0 4.8 3.7 268.5 365.2 11.9 10.7 6.6 394.4 Other Southern Europe 380.6 75.0 7.5 3.2 466.3 471.9 83.7 16.0 3.0 574.6 1,299.0 142.5 19.7 9.6 1,470.8 2,182.8 154.0 40.3 17.2 2,394.3 Northern Europe 768.3 64.4 19.6 13.4 865.7 1,050.8 88.3 38.2 16.8 1,194.1 APME 450.6 81.7 28.2 8.6 569.1 582.0 75.3 50.1 9.1 716.5 Total $ 3,254.1 $ 326.4 $ 86.4 $ 75.3 $ 3,742.2 $ 4,759.7 $ 369.3 $ 158.9 $ 85.2 $ 5,373.1 6 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 947.7 $ 60.6 $ 40.8 $ 77.7 $ 1,126.8 $ 1,080.0 $ 73.3 $ 47.0 $ 75.6 $ 1,275.9 Other Americas 686.7 19.7 8.6 5.8 720.8 778.2 25.8 12.0 6.5 822.5 1,634.4 80.3 49.4 83.5 1,847.6 1,858.2 99.1 59.0 82.1 2,098.4 Southern Europe: France 1,661.7 140.6 19.9 7.6 1,829.8 2,570.2 117.1 28.1 16.0 2,731.4 Italy 562.1 13.7 13.0 7.4 596.2 695.2 21.7 20.6 13.3 750.8 Other Southern Europe 796.5 165.6 21.4 6.0 989.5 818.9 164.3 30.2 7.5 1,020.9 3,020.3 319.9 54.3 21.0 3,415.5 4,084.3 303.1 78.9 36.8 4,503.1 Northern Europe 1,717.9 135.3 50.9 30.1 1,934.2 2,104.2 179.8 76.3 34.3 2,394.6 APME 917.2 164.9 65.1 16.8 1,164.0 1,165.4 146.1 93.8 16.6 1,421.9 Total $ 7,289.8 $ 700.4 $ 219.7 $ 151.4 $ 8,361.3 $ 9,212.1 $ 728.1 $ 308.0 $ 169.8 $ 10,418.0 11 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by timing of revenue recognition for each of our reportable segments: 3 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 507.6 $ 8.3 $ 515.9 $ 639.0 $ 13.7 $ 652.7 Other Americas 318.8 1.9 320.7 411.2 4.3 415.5 826.4 10.2 836.6 1,050.2 18.0 1,068.2 Southern Europe: France 729.5 6.5 736.0 1,412.6 12.7 1,425.3 Italy 264.1 4.4 268.5 384.6 9.8 394.4 Other Southern Europe 460.0 6.3 466.3 561.4 13.2 574.6 1,453.6 17.2 1,470.8 2,358.6 35.7 2,394.3 Northern Europe 848.6 17.1 865.7 1,160.8 33.3 1,194.1 APME 553.5 15.6 569.1 683.3 33.2 716.5 Total $ 3,682.1 $ 60.1 $ 3,742.2 $ 5,252.9 $ 120.2 $ 5,373.1 6 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 1,105.4 $ 21.4 $ 1,126.8 $ 1,249.2 $ 26.7 $ 1,275.9 Other Americas 715.3 5.5 720.8 814.2 8.3 822.5 1,820.7 26.9 1,847.6 2,063.4 35.0 2,098.4 Southern Europe: France 1,811.6 18.2 1,829.8 2,705.0 26.4 2,731.4 Italy 584.1 12.1 596.2 731.6 19.2 750.8 Other Southern Europe 971.5 18.0 989.5 995.8 25.1 1,020.9 3,367.2 48.3 3,415.5 4,432.4 70.7 4,503.1 Northern Europe 1,890.0 44.2 1,934.2 2,328.2 66.4 2,394.6 APME 1,128.8 35.2 1,164.0 1,360.2 61.7 1,421.9 Total $ 8,206.7 $ 154.6 $ 8,361.3 $ 10,184.2 $ 233.8 $ 10,418.0 (4) Share-Based Compensation Plans During the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $ 6.9 and $ 8.3 , respectively, and $ 11.5 and $ 12.9 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 6.8 and $ 5.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (5) Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 1.7 , which represents a deferred consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 212.7 as of June 30, 2019 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 154.4 was for cash and cash equivalents. The total cash impact of the acquisition was an 12 inflow of $ 104.8 , net of cash acquired of $ 317.5 . The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 80.4 , $ 32.5 represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. Excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 17.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This balance represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 13.0 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 48.2 and $ 41.4 during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $ 8.2 during the six months ended June 30, 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of June 30, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $ 32.1 during the six months ended June 30, 2020. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 23.4 reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 0.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ — $ — $ 7.3 Severance costs 4.7 11.8 19.3 1.0 0.2 37.0 Office closure and other costs 8.1 1.3 0.2 1.6 — 11.2 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out ( 10.5 ) ( 12.0 ) ( 7.0 ) ( 2.6 ) — ( 32.1 ) Balance, June 30, 2020 $ 2.7 $ 1.8 $ 18.7 $ - $ 0.2 $ 23.4 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.3 and $ 2.1 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020, respectively. (2) France had no restructuring reserve as of both December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.3 and $ 0.6 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020, respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense on a pre-tax loss resulting in a negative effective rate of 15.4 % for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to an income tax expense on pre-tax earnings resulting in an effective rate of 36.7 % for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was negative due to a pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the impact from the goodwill impairment charge, related to our Germany reporting unit, which was non-deductible. The 2020 rate was also unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax (losses) earnings, tax losses in certain countries for which we did no t recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the French business tax. The French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in the quarter due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. The negative effective tax rate of 15.4 % for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was significantly different than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the factors noted above. We recorded income tax expense on a pre-tax loss resulting in a negative effective rate of 62.4 % for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to an income tax expense on pre-tax earnings resulting in an effective rate of 38.6 % for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was negative due to a pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the impact from the goodwill impairment charge, related to our Germany reporting unit, which was non-deductible. The 2020 rate was also unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, restructuring costs and tax losses in certain countries for which we did no t recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the French business tax. The negative effective tax rate of 62.4 % for the 13 six months ended June 30, 2020 was significantly different than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the factors noted above, partially offset by a discrete favorable benefit for the successful appeal of a non-United States tax ruling. As of June 30, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 70.3 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 69.5 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2013 through 2020 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of June 30, 2020, we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Israel and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net (Loss) Earnings Per Share The calculations of net (loss) earnings per share - basic and net earnings per share - diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net (loss) earnings available to common shareholders $ ( 64.4 ) $ 127.3 $ ( 62.7 ) $ 180.8 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 58.2 60.0 58.5 60.3 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.1 — 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards — 0.3 — 0.3 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 58.2 60.4 58.5 60.7 Net (loss) earnings per share - basic $ ( 1.11 ) $ 2.12 $ ( 1.07 ) $ 3.00 Net (loss) earnings per share - diluted $ ( 1.11 ) $ 2.11 $ ( 1.07 ) $ 2.98 Due to the net loss for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020, the assumed exercise of share-based awards had an anti-dilutive effect and therefore was not included in the calculations of net loss per share – diluted for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2020. There were 1.1 million and 0.4 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net (loss) earnings per share - diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 0.9 million and 0.4 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net (loss) earnings per share - diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,178.2 $ — $ 1,178.2 $ 1,260.1 $ — $ 1,260.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 459.0 $ 386.7 $ 72.3 $ 460.5 $ 375.7 $ 84.8 Other 20.7 14.9 5.8 20.9 13.7 7.2 479.7 401.6 78.1 481.4 389.4 92.0 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 125.0 — 125.0 124.6 — 124.6 177.0 — 177.0 176.6 — 176.6 Total intangible assets $ 656.7 $ 401.6 $ 255.1 $ 658.0 $ 389.4 $ 268.6 14 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 644.2 and $ 577.4 as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2020 is expected to be $ 12.9 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2021- $ 15.9 , 2022- $ 12.7 , 2023- $ 10.0 , 2024 - $ 7.7 , 2025- $ 5.8 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2)(3 ) Northern Europe (3) APME Corporate (4) Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 535.6 $ 144.8 $ 374.6 $ 79.1 $ 126.0 $ 1,260.1 Currency impact ( 2.2 ) — ( 11.0 ) ( 1.9 ) — ( 15.1 ) Impairment Charge — — ( 66.8 ) — — ( 66.8 ) Balance, June 30, 2020 $ 533.4 $ 144.8 $ 296.8 $ 77.2 $ 126.0 $ 1,178.2 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 490.3 and $ 490.2 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 67.3 and $ 67.4 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.6 and $ 3.8 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020. (3) The impairment charge of $ 66.8 relates to our Germany reporting unit, which was recorded during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (4) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is now part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2020 2019 United States $ 545.7 $ 545.8 Netherlands 109.7 109.5 United Kingdom 90.9 97.3 France 67.4 67.3 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Germany — 67.2 Other reporting units 302.4 310.9 Total goodwill $ 1,178.2 $ 1,260.1 15 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost $ 5.1 $ 4.3 $ 10.2 $ 6.8 Interest cost 2.3 3.2 4.6 6.3 Expected return on assets ( 3.2 ) ( 3.6 ) ( 6.6 ) ( 5.9 ) Settlement loss — — 10.2 — Other 0.7 0.4 1.6 0.9 Total benefit cost $ 4.9 $ 4.3 $ 20.0 $ 8.1 Retiree Health Care Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Interest cost $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 Prior service credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) Total benefit credit $ ( 0.1 ) $ — $ ( 0.2 ) $ ( 0.1 ) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, contributions made to our pension plans were $ 5.0 and $ 11.0 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 and $ 0.6 , respectively. During 2020, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 17.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Pension Settlement During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from the Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement will be utilized to fund future qualified 401(k) plan contributions following the conclusion of the standard PBGC audit. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2020 2019 Foreign currency translation $ ( 308.1 ) $ ( 260.5 ) Translation gain on derivative instruments, net of income taxes of $( 9.0 ) and $( 9.1 ), respectively 14.5 13.1 Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 121.9 ) ( 121.5 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $( 35.2 ) and $( 30.9 ), respectively ( 65.3 ) ( 74.1 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 2.2 and $ 1.6 , respectively 1.7 2.0 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 479.1 ) $ ( 441.0 ) 16 Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a benefit of $ 0.4 and an expense of $ 0.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a benefit of $ 1.0 and an expense of $ 1.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $ 1.09 per share on both May 8, 2020 and May 10, 2019 . The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020 . The 2019 dividends were paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019 . Share Repurchases In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 63.8 . The repurchases in the first half of 2020 all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. During the first six months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $ 101.0 under the 2018 authorization. As of June 30, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. (12) Interest and Other Expenses (Income), Net Interest and other expenses (income), net consisted of the following: 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 10.4 $ 11.2 $ 21.5 $ 21.4 Interest income ( 3.1 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 6.8 ) ( 2.6 ) Foreign exchange loss (gain) 0.5 ( 0.5 ) 3.6 2.4 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 2.0 ) ( 79.8 ) 8.0 ( 79.5 ) Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 5.8 $ ( 70.2 ) $ 26.3 $ ( 58.3 ) (1) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net for the six months ended June 30, 2020 includes a $ 10.2 pension settlement loss related to one of our United States plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 includes an $ 80.4 gain related to our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. 17 Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 448.2 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 557.3 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of June 30, 2020. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 3 Months Ended June 30, 6 Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2020 2019 2020 2019 Euro Notes $ ( 18.3 ) $ ( 13.9 ) $ ( 1.9 ) $ 8.5 Cross-currency swaps 9.9 — 2.4 — 18 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019 we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019: (Loss) Gain Reclassified (Loss) Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 3 Months Ended June 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified 3 Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2020 2019 from AOCI into Income 2020 2019 Cross-currency swaps $ ( 0.9 ) $ 5.0 Interest and other expenses (income), net $ ( 1.0 ) $ 5.4 (Loss) Gain Reclassified (Loss) Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 6 Months Ended June 30, Location of (Loss) Gain Reclassified 6 Months Ended June 30, Instrument 2020 2019 from AOCI into Income 2020 2019 Cross-currency swaps $ 4.8 $ 5.0 Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 4.7 $ 5.4 We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2020 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-designated instruments 19 We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income 3 Months Ended June 30, 6 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 0.5 $ 9.1 $ 0.3 $ 9.2 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Assets June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 15.7 $ 9.7 Total instruments $ 15.7 $ 9.7 Liabilities June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt $ 1,005.5 $ 1,002.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities 4.1 6.0 Total instruments $ 1,009.6 $ 1,008.9 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,033.2 and $ 1,062.5 as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,005.5 and $ 1,002.9 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 103.8 and $ 107.3 as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). (14) Leases The components of lease expense were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, 6 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Operating lease expense $ 35.6 $ 35.0 $ 71.6 $ 69.7 Short-term lease expense 3.3 6.0 7.2 12.1 Other lease expense (1) $ 4.2 $ 4.8 $ 8.5 $ 9.9 Total lease expense $ 43.1 $ 45.8 $ 87.3 $ 91.7 (1) Other lease expense includes variable lease expense and sublease income. 20 Other information related to leases was as follows: 6 Months Ended June 30, Supplemental Cash Flow Information 2020 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 71.6 $ 64.8 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 26.0 69.7 June 30, December 31, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2020 2019 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 409.1 $ 448.5 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 113.4 $ 122.1 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 308.5 336.7 Total operating lease liabilities $ 421.9 $ 458.8 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 5.5 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 3.1 % Maturities of operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2020 were as follows: (In millions) Period Ending June 30, 2020 Operating Leases Remainder of 2020 $ 67.0 2021 109.5 2022 84.6 2023 58.5 2024 41.9 2025 28.1 Thereafter 73.2 Total future undiscounted lease payments $ 462.8 Less imputed interest $ ( 40.9 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 421.9 (15) Segment Data Effective January 1, 2020, our segment reporting was realigned due to our Right Management business being combined with each of our respective country business units. Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, outplacement services, talent management services, and other services. Segment 21 revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 3 Months Ended June 30, 6 Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 515.9 $ 652.7 $ 1,126.8 $ 1,275.9 Other Americas 320.7 415.5 720.8 822.5 836.6 1,068.2 1,847.6 2,098.4 Southern Europe: France 736.0 1,425.3 1,829.8 2,731.4 Italy 268.5 394.4 596.2 750.8 Other Southern Europe 466.3 574.6 989.5 1,020.9 1,470.8 2,394.3 3,415.5 4,503.1 Northern Europe 865.7 1,194.1 1,934.2 2,394.6 APME 569.1 716.5 1,164.0 1,421.9 Consolidated (b) $ 3,742.2 $ 5,373.1 $ 8,361.3 $ 10,418.0 Operating unit profit (loss): (c) Americas: United States $ 9.2 $ 37.7 $ 11.5 $ 54.3 Other Americas 10.5 17.8 24.8 33.0 19.7 55.5 36.3 87.3 Southern Europe: France ( 2.5 ) 75.7 35.5 131.0 Italy 11.0 29.8 25.2 50.1 Other Southern Europe 3.6 18.1 4.4 29.1 12.1 123.6 65.1 210.2 Northern Europe 0.3 25.6 ( 13.8 ) 27.5 APME 18.0 29.7 34.9 50.3 50.1 234.4 122.5 375.3 Corporate expenses ( 26.6 ) ( 31.9 ) ( 54.4 ) ( 59.8 ) Goodwill impairment charges ( 66.8 ) ( 64.0 ) ( 66.8 ) ( 64.0 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 6.7 ) ( 7.7 ) ( 13.6 ) ( 15.2 ) Operating (loss) profit ( 50.0 ) 130.8 ( 12.3 ) 236.3 Interest and other (expenses) income, net ( 5.8 ) 70.2 ( 26.3 ) 58.3 (Loss) earnings before income taxes $ ( 55.8 ) $ 201.0 $ ( 38.6 ) $ 294.6 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 2.4 and $ 3.7 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 5.4 and $ 7.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 122.3 and $ 154.3 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 198.8 and $ 311.2 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 2.8 and $ 4.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 6.1 and $ 9.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 128.1 and $ 163.2 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 210.4 and $ 406.2 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 22 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on pages 35-36 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency.

Business Overview Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the second quarter of 2020, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. Our second quarter results were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, which sharply reduced demand for our services across almost all of our operations. By the end of March, significant lockdown measures had been implemented in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries with the majority of lockdown measures being eased in May. During the quarter, we experienced turbulent and uncertain market conditions, reflecting the unprecedented speed and magnitude of the shutdowns. Effects were felt across the world in March and April and quickly impacted the labor markets, resulting in rapidly rising unemployment as well as high levels of government supported furloughs. As the quarter drew to a close, indications are that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis had been contained in many parts of the world, and economies had begun to slowly reopen. However, some countries in Latin America and parts of the United States continue to deal with the COVID-19 crisis at elevated levels. Continued uncertainty remains as to the future impact of the pandemic on global and local economies. This may depend on multiple factors which cannot be predicted, including public health conditions and the willingness of local and national governments to re-open commerce and to continue with fiscal stimulus packages. What started as a sudden and swift slowdown of the global economies and labor markets is expected to take much longer to recover around the world, and consequently we expect any improvement in labor market conditions will be slow and gradual. During the second quarter of 2020, the United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets, which therefore had an unfavorable impact on our reported results. Our reported revenues from services decreased 30.4% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. As noted above, most of the decline is due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the results were further impacted by the relative weakness of other currencies against the United States dollar 23 compared to the same period in 2019, which generally may understate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 2.4% unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately $0.02 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, our businesses experienced significant changes in revenue trends from the previous quarter reflecting the sudden drop of activity that started in March. Our consolidated revenues were down 28.0% year-over-year in constant currency in the quarter, a decline from the 5.9% year-over-year constant currency decrease in the first quarter of 2020. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency revenue year-over-year decrease was 26.6% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to a 7.1% decrease in the first quarter of 2020. While revenue declines persisted throughout the second quarter, the most significant portion of the year-over-year revenue decline occurred in our European markets during April and the first few weeks of May as governments put states of emergency and related lockdown requirements into place. After adjusting for billing days, we experienced a gradual improvement in the rates of decline throughout the second quarter of 2020 with monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 31% in April, 26% in May, and 24% in June. The improvement in the rate of decline during the quarter reflects the reopening of economies largely in May as governments in some of our largest countries lifted lock-down requirements. We experienced a 45.0% decrease (-43.4% in constant currency and -38.4% in organic constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business in the quarter as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Our Talent Solutions business, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, experienced a decline in the quarter, which was driven mostly by RPO activity. We experienced a sharp reduction in RPO activity as many client programs initiated hiring freezes due to the COVID-19 crisis. Our MSP business has been resilient during the crisis and experienced growth during the quarter. Our Right Management business also experienced a decline during the quarter. Although Right Management has historically experienced an increase in outplacement activity during economic downturns, we believe client uncertainty as to the duration of the downturn has chilled outplacement spending. As a result, we did not see an increase in outplacement activity during the second quarter, although we experienced gradual improvement in the rate of revenue decline as the quarter progressed. During the second quarter of 2020, most of our markets experienced revenue declines due to the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced a revenue decrease in Southern Europe, mainly due to revenue declines in France and Italy due to the severe impact from the crisis. We experienced a revenue decrease in Northern Europe due to the declines in all of our key markets as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and reduced demand from very challenging conditions in the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector, in Germany, which has not experienced the improvement in the rate of revenue decline as the second quarter progressed that many of our other European markets have experienced. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency decrease in the Americas was 18.1% due mostly to a decrease in the United States related to the COVID-19 crisis. After adjusting for billing days, revenues in organic constant currency decreased 4.6% in APME due to the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in Japan due to an increase in Manpower staffing revenues. Our gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 decreased due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and the decrease in our staffing/interim margin in the Americas, Southern Europe and Northern Europe. The decrease in the staffing/interim margin was due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business and higher rates of sickness and absenteeism in certain countries at the beginning of the quarter, partially offset by reduced direct costs in certain countries due to government crisis response programs and our execution of various bill/pay yield initiatives due to the COVID-19 crisis. We recorded $72.8 million of goodwill and other impairment charges related to our investment in Germany and capitalized software in the United States ($66.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively) in the second quarter of 2020. We experienced an operating loss of $50.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to an operating profit of $130.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, with our operating profit margin decreasing 370 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the goodwill and other impairment charges of $72.8 million and $65.6 million incurred in the second quarter of both 2020 and 2019, respectively, our operating profit was down 87.5% in constant currency while operating profit margin was down 310 basis 24 points compared to the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating profit margin reflects the material deleveraging that accompanied the sudden decrease in revenues during the quarter as government lockdowns and restrictions were in effect. We took significant actions in late March and early April, which allowed us to reduce selling and administrative expenses to partially offset the revenue and gross profit declines in the second quarter of 2020. This included leveraging government unemployment related benefits, which allowed us to move unutilized staff and associates quickly onto these programs. This also included the short-term action of cutting discretionary costs and scaling operations back. In addition to these implemented initiatives, we are prepared to take further cost actions to optimize our business structure through this economic downturn with the intention of simultaneously preserving our ability to rebound when market conditions improve. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continuing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. As we manage through this crisis and prepare our business for future opportunities we would also like to emphasize the following points: • Many of our leaders have experience managing through economic downturns, and many of our senior operational leaders previously managed parts of our business during the economic downturn in 2008-2009. We believe this is valuable experience for the current economic environment. Additionally, we have enhanced our enterprise risk management framework in recent years, and we have business continuity plans which have been executed at a global, regional and country level. • The technology investments we have been making for the last few years as part of our transformational activities have facilitated a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis. As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately 90% of our full-time equivalent employees working remotely while mitigating potential productivity losses. We have also extended our cyber and information security capability to accelerate the ability for some of our associates and consultants to work for our clients at home mitigating potential operational or financial losses. Expectations of when our full-time equivalent employees return to the workplace will depend on a number of factors including the impact such a return would have on the safety, health and well-being of our employees as well as the impact from any government mandates or restrictions. • Our business has benefitted from our diversification across geographies, industries, and offerings, that we believe position us well to endure the COVID-19 crisis. We believe this diversification may likewise position us to take advantage of market opportunities that present themselves. For example, during the second quarter, we have seen much smaller declines within our Experis business compared to the Manpower business, and we are positioned with a large portion of our business focused on providing professional services and Talent Solutions. We believe our strategy to improve the diversification of our business through the growth of Experis will facilitate growth following the crisis as companies accelerate technology investments. Additionally, portions of our Talent Solutions business are assisting our clients through this downturn with customized solutions. Right Management has not yet seen an increase in overall outplacement activity during the second quarter, which we believe is due to client uncertainty as to the duration of the downturn, although we did experience gradual improvement in the rate of revenue decline as the quarter progressed. 25 Operating Results - Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to 2019. (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 3,742.2 $ 5,373.1 (30.4 )% (28.0 )% Cost of services 3,165.5 4,502.7 (29.7 )% (27.3 )% Gross profit 576.7 870.4 (33.8 )% (31.9 )% Gross profit margin 15.4 % 16.2 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 559.9 675.6 (17.1 )% (14.9 )% Goodwill impairment charges 66.8 64.0 4.2 % 4.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 626.7 739.6 (15.3 )% (13.2 )% Operating (loss) profit (50.0 ) 130.8 N/A N/A Operating (loss) profit margin -1.3 % 2.4 % Interest and other expenses (income), net 5.8 (70.2 ) N/A (Loss) earnings before income taxes (55.8 ) 201.0 N/A N/A Provision for income taxes 8.6 73.7 (88.4 )% Effective income tax rate -15.4 % 36.7 % Net (loss) earnings $ (64.4 ) $ 127.3 N/A N/A Net (loss) earnings per share – diluted $ (1.11 ) $ 2.11 N/A N/A Weighted average shares – diluted 58.2 60.4 (3.6 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 30.4% (-28.0% in constant currency and -26.7% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 38.6% (-37.7% in constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 48.4% (-47.5% in constant currency), which was primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower staffing services and a 45.6% decrease (-44.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease also includes a decrease in Italy of 31.9% (-30.7% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 56.2% decrease (-55.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis; • decreased demand for services in most of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 27.5% (-24.2% in constant currency), primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower business and a 47.2% decrease (-45.0% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordics, and Belgium of 24.2%, 33.5%, 27.9%, 26.8% and 39.2%, respectively (-21.6%, -32.2%, -26.4%, -20.3%, and -38.0%, respectively, in constant currency); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 21.0% (-23.0% on an organic basis) primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 34.6% decrease in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in demand for our MSP offering and outplacement services; • a revenue decrease in APME of 20.6% (-19.1% in constant currency and -3.4% in organic constant currency) due to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019 (the “Deconsolidation”), partially offset by an increase in revenues in Japan and an increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within the Manpower business; and • a 2.4% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 80 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 40 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 45.0% (-43.4% in constant currency and -38.4% in organic constant currency); and 26 • a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from a deterioration in our staffing/interim margin in the Americas, Southern Europe and Northern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business and higher rates of sickness and absenteeism in certain countries at the beginning of the quarter, partially offset by reduced direct costs in certain countries due to government crisis response programs and our execution of various bill/pay yield initiatives due to the COVID-19 crisis. The 15.3% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2020 (-13.2% in constant currency; -11.2% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 20.4% decrease (-18.2% in constant currency and -15.9% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs due to a reduction of salary-related costs as a result of lower headcount, a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs; • a 12.5% decrease (-10.3% in constant currency and -8.2% in organic constant currency) in non-personnel related costs, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, due to cost management actions taken across all segments as a result of revenue declines; • the reduction in recurring selling and administrative costs of $19.5 million as a result of the Deconsolidation in July 2019; and • a 2.1% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges to $72.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 from $65.6 million in the second quarter of 2019; and • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $1.8 million incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 290 basis points in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to: • a 220 basis point unfavorable impact from expense deleveraging, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline; • a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from acquisitions and dispositions. Interest and other expenses (income), net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses (income), net was expense of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to income of $70.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. Net interest expense decreased $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 to $7.3 million from $10.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to an increase interest income as a result of higher cash balances. Miscellaneous income decreased to $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 from $79.8 million in the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to the $80.4 million gain that was recorded in the second quarter of 2019 from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland and decrease in noncontrolling interest expense as a result of a decrease in earnings in a joint venture in Germany. We recorded income tax expense on a pre-tax loss resulting in a negative effective rate of 15.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to an income tax expense on pre-tax earnings resulting in an effective rate of 36.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was negative due to a pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the impact from the goodwill impairment charge, related to our Germany reporting unit, which was non-deductible. The 2020 rate was also unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax (losses) earnings, tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding 27 tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the French business tax. The French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in the quarter due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. The negative effective tax rate of 15.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was significantly different than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the factors noted above . We compute our quarterly effective tax rate in part based upon an estimate of projected annual earnings before income taxes. The COVID-19 crisis has created uncertainty in predicting future earnings before income taxes and its impact to the second quarter of 2020 along with future quarters quarterly effective tax rates may be material. Net (loss) earnings per share - diluted was a loss of $1.11 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to earnings of $2.11 in the second quarter of 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net (loss) earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.23 and $1.26 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in the second quarter of 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.32 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 58.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 from 60.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the second quarter of 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the second quarter of 2019. Operating Results – Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 8,361.3 $ 10,418.0 (19.7 )% (17.3 )% Cost of services 7,060.6 8,742.8 (19.2 )% (16.8 )% Gross profit 1,300.7 1,675.2 (22.4 )% (20.2 )% Gross profit margin 15.6 % 16.1 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charges 1,246.2 1,374.9 (9.4 )% (7.0 )% Goodwill impairment charges 66.8 64.0 4.2 % 4.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 1,313.0 1,438.9 (8.8 )% (6.5 )% Operating (loss) profit (12.3 ) 236.3 N/A N/A Operating (loss) profit margin -0.1 % 2.3 % Interest and other expenses (income), net 26.3 (58.3 ) N/A (Loss) earnings before income taxes (38.6 ) 294.6 N/A N/A Provision for income taxes 24.1 113.8 (78.8 )% Effective income tax rate -62.4 % 38.6 % Net (loss) earnings $ (62.7 ) $ 180.8 N/A N/A Net (loss) earnings per share – diluted $ (1.07 ) $ 2.98 N/A N/A Weighted average shares – diluted 58.7 60.7 (3.2 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 19.7% (-17.3% in constant currency and -16.6% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 24.2% (-22.6% in constant currency; -24.6% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 33.0% (-31.3% in constant currency), which was primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower staffing services and a 28.9% decrease (-27.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease also includes a decrease in Italy of 20.6% (-18.6% in constant currency), which was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 37.4% decrease (-35.7% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis; 28 • decreased demand for services in most of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 19.2% (-16.0% in constant currency; -15.8% in organic constant currency), primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower business and a 31.7% decrease (-29.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordics, and Belgium of 13.2%, 25.2%, 23.5%, 21.7% and 28.9% , respectively (-11.0%, -23.3%, -21.5%, -15.4%, and -27.1%, respectively, in constant currency); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 11.7% (-14.1% on an organic basis) primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 13.2% decrease in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in our Talent Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering and outplacement services; • a revenue decrease in APME of 18.1% (-16.6% in constant currency; -1.1% in organic constant currency) due to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019 (the “Deconsolidation”), partially offset by an increase in revenues in Japan and an increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within the Manpower business; and • a 2.4% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 50 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 29.5% (-27.4% in constant currency and -22.5% in organic constant currency); • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from a deterioration in our staffing/interim margin in the Americas, Southern Europe and Northern Europe due to the higher mix of our lower-margin enterprise client business and higher rates of sickness and absenteeism in certain countries and increased direct costs associated with early termination of client contracts during the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by reduced direct costs in certain countries due to government crisis response programs and our execution of various bill/pay yield initiatives due to the COVID-19 crisis; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact due to the margin decrease in our Talent Based Outsourcing business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany. The 8.8% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first half of 2020 (-6.5% in constant currency; -5.2% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 12.8% decrease (-10.5% in constant currency and -9.0% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs due to a reduction of salary-related costs as a result of lower headcount and a decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs; • a 6.0% decrease (-3.6% in constant currency and -2.4% in organic constant currency) in non-personnel related costs, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges and restructuring costs, due to cost management actions taken across all segments as a result of revenue declines; • restructuring costs of $48.2 million incurred in the first half of 2020 compared to $39.8 million incurred in the first half of 2019; • the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges to $72.8 million in the first half of 2020 from $65.6 million in the first half of 2019; and 29 • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $16.3 million incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019; partially offset by • a 2.3% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and • the reduction in recurring selling and administrative costs of $36.5 million as a result of the Deconsolidation in July 2019. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 190 basis points in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019 due primarily to: • a 130 basis point unfavorable impact from expense deleveraging, excluding goodwill and other impairment charges, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline; • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in goodwill and other impairment charges; • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Interest and other expenses (income), net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses (income), net was expense of $26.3 million in the first half of 2020 compared to income of $58.3 million in the first half of 2019. Net interest expense decreased $4.1 million in the first half of 2020 to $14.7 million from $18.8 million in the first half of 2019 primarily due to an increase interest income as a result of higher cash balances. Miscellaneous expense was $8 million in the first half of 2020 compared to miscellaneous income of $79.5 million in the first half of 2019. The change is primarily due to the $80.4 million from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in the first half of 2019, the pension settlement expense of $10.2 million recorded in the first half of 2020 and the decrease in noncontrolling interest expense as a result of a decrease in earnings in a joint venture in Germany. We recorded income tax expense on a pre-tax loss resulting in a negative effective rate of 62.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to an income tax expense on pre-tax earnings resulting in an effective rate of 38.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The 2020 rate was negative due to a pre-tax loss that primarily resulted from the impact from the goodwill impairment charge, related to our Germany reporting unit, which was non-deductible. The 2020 rate was also unfavorably impacted by the relatively low level and mix of pre-tax earnings, restructuring costs and tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, and the French business tax. The negative effective tax rate of 62.4% in the first half of 2020 was significantly different than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the factors noted above, partially offset by a discrete favorable benefit for the successful appeal of a non-United States tax ruling. Net (loss) earnings per share - diluted was a loss of $1.07 in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to earnings of $2.98 in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net (loss) earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.05 per share in the first half of 2020. Restructuring costs recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net (loss) earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.68 and $0.52 per share, net of tax, in the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in the first half of 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $1.22 and $1.26 per share in the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pension settlement expense recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2020 negatively impacted net loss per share – diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in the first half of 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.32 per share in the first half of 2019. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 58.5 million in the first half of 2020 from 60.7 million in the first half of 2019. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first half of 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the first half of 2019, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the first half of 2019. 30 Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 21.7% (-16.7% in constant currency; -17.9% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 21.0% (-23.0% on an organic basis) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 34.6%, all due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. These decreases in the United States were partially offset by increased demand for our MSP offering and outplacement services. Our RPO business in the United States has experienced significant client hiring freezes in the quarter as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 22.8% (-10.0% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. This decline was driven by decreases in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Brazil of 26.4%, 7.6%, 10.1%, 31.3%, 47.0% and 27.4%, respectively (-10.3%, -4.3%, increase of 38.7%, -29.1%, -37.1% and -0.5%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 12.0% (-7.9% in constant currency, -9.4% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 11.7% (-14.1% on an organic basis) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 13.2%, both due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. These decreases in the United States were partially offset by increased demand for our MSP offering, mostly in the first quarter of 2020, and outplacement services. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 12.4% (-2.0% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. This decline was driven by decreases in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Brazil of 14.9%, 0.3%, 7.6%, 11.3%, 29.6% and 25.6%, respectively (-5.3%, increase of 1.9%, increase of 44.2%, -8.9%, -19.2% and -5.6%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. After adjusting for billing days, the United States experienced monthly organic year-over-year revenue declines of 24% in April, 22% in May, and 23% in June. In July 2020, the United States experienced an organic year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 14%. It is uncertain if additional COVID-19 related restrictions will be introduced in different parts of the United States, and how those developments will impact our revenue trends. Gross profit margin increased in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to gross profit margin increase in the United States from our higher margin MSP offering and outplacement services. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 37.9% (-36.5% in constant currency) and a decline in the staffing/interim margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues came from our lower margin enterprise clients. Gross profit margin was flat for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019 as the increases in our higher margin MSP offering and outplacement services were offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 16.3% (-15.0% in constant currency) and a decline in the staffing/interim margin due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of our revenues came from our lower margin enterprise clients. In the second quarter of 2020, selling and administrative expenses decreased 6.2% (-2.9% in constant currency and -4.0% in organic constant currency) primarily due to the decrease in salary-related costs, because of lower headcount, and discretionary expenses. These decreases were partially offset by the impairment charge of $6.0 million recorded in the United States related to capitalized software and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.1% (2.9% in constant currency and 1.6% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the software impairment charge in the United States, the increase in restructuring costs to $12.8 million in the first half of 2020 compared to $9.8 million in the first half of 2019, a bad debt expense and a state sales tax related charge incurred in the first half of 2020, and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States. These increases were partially offset by decreases in salary-related costs, due to lower headcount, and discretionary expenses. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 2.4% and 5.2% for the second quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 1.8% in the second quarter of 2020 from 5.8% in 2019. The margin decrease in 2020 in the United States was primarily due to the software impairment charge and expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. Other 31 Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.3% in the second quarter of 2020 from 4.3% in the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to the decrease in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. OUP margin in the Americas was 2.0% and 4.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 1.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from 4.3% in 2019. The margin decrease in 2020 in the United States was primarily due to the software impairment charge, increase in restructuring costs and expense deleveraging. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 from 4.0% in 2019 primarily due to a decline in the gross profit margin. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased 38.6% (-37.7% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, revenues from services decreased 48.4% (-47.5% in constant currency) in France (which represents 50% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 31.9% (-30.7% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 18% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 45.6% decrease (-44.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment busines s, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 56.2% decrease (-55.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 18.9% (-18.2% in constant currency) during the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 53.4% (-52.6% in constant currency), both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues from services decreased 24.2% (-22.6% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, revenues from services decreased 33.0% (-31.3% in constant currency) in France and decreased 20.6% (-18.6% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 28.9% (-27.1% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in Italy was primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 37.4% (-35.7% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 3.1% (-2.3% in constant currency) during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 28.8% (-27.8% in constant currency), both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. After adjusting for billing days, France experienced monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 62% in April, 49% in May, and 33% in June. In July 2020, France has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 25%. Although improvement in revenue trends throughout the quarter were steady in France, the rate of improvement in the revenue trend slowed somewhat in July. After adjusting for billing days, Italy experienced monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 41% in April, 31% in May, and 20% in June. In July 2020, Italy has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 15%. Gross profit margin decreased in both the second quarter and first half of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decreases of 51.5% and 31.1%, respectively (-50.6% and -29.6% in constant currency, respectively) in the permanent recruitment business and a decrease in the staffing/interim gross profit margins in France and certain countries within Other Southern Europe. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 20.9% (-19.6% in constant currency) during the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 9.6% (-7.7% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. We took significant actions in France and Italy in March and April to reduce our costs to help offset the materially reduced revenues in the second quarter of 2020. In both France and Italy, we transitioned full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs and other initiatives and eliminated a significant amount of discretionary spend to manage through the COVID-19 crisis. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter and first half of 2020 was primarily due to the decreases in personnel costs, as a result of a reduction in headcount, decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in certain markets. The decreases are also due to the reduction of our discretionary expenses. The decreases in the first half of 2020 were offset by the increase in restructuring costs to $13.1 million in the first half of 32 2020 compared to $ 5.4 million in the first half of 2019 and the additional recurring selling and administrative costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 0.8% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to 5.2% for 2019. France experienced a decrease to an operating unit loss of 0.3% for the second quarter of 2020 from an OUP of 5.3% in 2019. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 4.1% for the second quarter of 2020 from 7.5% for 2019. The decreases in France and Italy were primarily due to the decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 0.7% for the second quarter of 2020 from 3.1% in 2019, due to the decrease in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 1.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 4.7% in 2019. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 1.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 4.8% in 2019. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 4.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 6.7% in 2019. The decreases in France and Italy were primarily due to the decline in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 0.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2.8% in 2019, due to the decrease in the gross profit margin, the increase in restructuring costs to $11.5 million in the first half of 2020 from $3.1 million in the first half of 2019, and expense deleveraging. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 35%, 16%, 22%, 11%, and 7%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 27.5% (-24.2% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 24.2%, 33.5%, 26.8%, 27.9% and 39.2% (-21.6%, -32.2%, -20.3%, -26.4% and -38.0%, respectively, in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and reduced demand from very challenging conditions in the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive sector, in Germany, which did not experience the improvement in the rate of revenue decline as the second quarter progressed that many of our other European markets have experienced. The decrease was also due to a 47.2% decrease (-45.0% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues from services decreased 19.2% (-16.0% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 13.2%, 25.2%, 21.7%, 23.5% and 28.9% (-11.0%, -23.3%, -15.4%, -21.5% and -27.1%, respectively, in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 31.7% decrease (-29.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. After adjusting for billing days, the United Kingdom experienced monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 17% in April, 26% in May, and 23% in June. In July 2020, the United Kingdom has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 21%. After adjusting for billing days, Germany experienced monthly year-over-year revenue declines of 33% in April, 32% in May, and 32% in June. In July 2020, Germany has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 33%. Gross profit margin decreased in both the second quarter and first half of 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decreases in our permanent recruitment business for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019, and the declines in the Experis interim margins due to client mix changes, as a higher percentage of revenues consisted of revenues from our lower margin enterprise clients, and the margin decrease in our Talent Based Outsourcing business primarily related to the lower utilization of consultants in Germany. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 22.8% (-19.6% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 14.7% (-11.4% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to the decreases in personnel costs, as a result of reductions in headcount, decreases in variable incentive costs due to declines in profitability in most markets, and the benefits related to the transition of full-time equivalent employees onto government temporary unemployment programs in certain markets. The decreases are also due to the decline in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices, and a reduction of our discretionary expenses. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in the goodwill impairment charge in Germany of $66.8 million in the second quarter and first half of 2020 compared to $60.2 million in the second quarter and first half of 2019. The decrease in the first half of 2020 was also 33 partially offset by the increase of restructuring costs to $19.5 million in the first half of 2020 from $18.7 million in the first half of 2019. OUP margin for Northern Europe for the second quarter of 2020 decreased to 0.0% compared to 2.1% in 2019. Northern Europe experienced a decrease to an operating unit loss of 0.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2020 from an OUP of 1.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decreases were primarily due to the declines in the gross profit margins, increase in the goodwill impairment charge, and expense deleveraging. The decrease in the six months ended June 20, 2020 was also due to the increase in restructuring costs. APME Revenues from services decreased 20.6% (-19.1% in constant currency and -3.4% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In Japan (which represents 47% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 11.3% (8.9% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and an increase in our Talent Solutions business, partially offset by a 6.0% decrease (-8.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business,. In Australia (which represents 16% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 24.9% (-20.1% in constant currency) due to the decline in demand for our staffing/interim business and the 14.3% (-9.0% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the Deconsolidation, and the decline in demand for our staffing and Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business due to the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues from services decreased 18.1% (-16.6% in constant currency and -1.1% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 2019. In Japan, revenues from services increased 10.5% (8.7% in constant currency) due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services, an increase in our Talent Solutions business and the favorable impact of approximately two additional billings days in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were partially offset by a 1.0% decrease (-2.7% in constant currency) decrease in our permanent recruitment business. In Australia, revenues from services decreased 27.0% (-21.5% in constant currency) due to the decrease in our staffing/interim revenues, as a result of our decision to exit certain businesses with low-margins to improve profitability and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, and the 10.4% (-4.0% in constant currency) decline in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the Deconsolidation, and the decline in demand for our staffing and Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business due to the COVID-19 crisis. Gross profit margin decreased in both the second quarter and first half of 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decreases in our permanent recruitment business of 41.9% and 35.6%, respectively (-39.8 and -32.8%, respectively, in constant currency; -14.3% and -8.3%, respectively, in organic constant currency), partially offset by the increases in our staffing/interim margins due to the Deconsolidation. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 18.2% (-16.6% in constant currency; and increase of 6.1% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 16.6% (-14.7% in constant currency; and increase of 6.1% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were primarily due to the reduction of recurring selling and administrative costs as a result of the Deconsolidation. The decrease in the first half of 2020 was also due to the decrease of restructuring costs to $2.6 million in the first half of 2020 compared to $4.4 million in the first half of 2019. These decreases in the second quarter and first half of 2020 were partially offset by increases in costs to support the increases in revenues in certain markets OUP margin for APME decreased to 3.1% in the second quarter of 2020 from 4.1%. OUP margin decreased to 3.0% in the first half of 2020 from 3.5% in 2019. The decreases were due to the declines in the gross profit margins and expense deleveraging. In the first half of 2020, these decreases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. 34 Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: 3 Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to 2019 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States 515.9 (21.0 )% — (21.0 )% 2.0 % (23.0 )% Other Americas 320.7 (22.8 )% (12.8 )% (10.0 )% — (10.0 )% 836.6 (21.7 )% (5.0 )% (16.7 )% 1.2 % (17.9 )% Southern Europe: France 736.0 (48.4 )% (0.9 )% (47.5 )% — (47.5 )% Italy 268.5 (31.9 )% (1.2 )% (30.7 )% — (30.7 )% Other Southern Europe 466.3 (18.9 )% (0.7 )% (18.2 )% — (18.2 )% 1,470.8 (38.6 )% (0.9 )% (37.7 )% — (37.7 )% Northern Europe 865.7 (27.5 )% (3.3 )% (24.2 )% (0.2 )% (24.0 )% APME 569.1 (20.6 )% (1.5 )% (19.1 )% (15.7 )% (3.4 )% Consolidated 3,742.2 (30.4 )% (2.4 )% (28.0 )% (1.3 )% (26.7 )% Gross Profit 576.7 (33.8 )% (1.9 )% (31.9 )% (1.9 )% (30.0 )% Selling and Administrative Expenses 626.7 (15.3 )% (2.1 )% (13.2 )% (2.0 )% (11.2 )% Operating Loss (50.0 ) N/A — N/A — N/A (a) In millions for the three months ended June 30, 2020. 35 6 Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to 2019 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States $ 1,126.8 (11.7 )% - (11.7 )% 2.4 % (14.1 )% Other Americas 720.8 (12.4 )% (10.4 )% (2.0 )% — (2.0 )% 1,847.6 (12.0 )% (4.1 )% (7.9 )% 1.5 % (9.4 )% Southern Europe: France 1,829.8 (33.0 )% (1.7 )% (31.3 )% — (31.3 )% Italy 596.2 (20.6 )% (2.0 )% (18.6 )% — (18.6 )% Other Southern Europe 989.5 (3.1 )% (0.8 )% (2.3 )% 8.8 % (11.1 )% 3,415.5 (24.2 )% (1.6 )% (22.6 )% 2.0 % (24.6 )% Northern Europe 1,934.2 (19.2 )% (3.2 )% (16.0 )% (0.2 )% (15.8 )% APME 1,164.0 (18.1 )% (1.5 )% (16.6 )% (15.5 )% (1.1 )% Consolidated $ 8,361.3 (19.7 )% (2.4 )% (17.3 )% (0.7 )% (16.6 )% Gross Profit $ 1,300.7 (22.4 )% (2.2 )% (20.2 )% (1.2 )% (19.0 )% Selling and Administrative Expenses $ 1,313.0 (8.8 )% (2.3 )% (6.5 )% (1.3 )% (5.2 )% Operating Loss $ (12.3 ) N/A — N/A — N/A (a) In millions for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of June 30, 2020, we had $1,295.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer record United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $596.1 million and $277.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $536.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $35.6 million of cash generated during the six months ended June 30, 2019. These changes were primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable, due to collections and the receivables not being replaced at the same level as a result of a decrease in demand for our services, and the benefit of certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis. These improvements in our cash flows were partially offset by the decrease in our payroll-related liabilities due to lower activity. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,224.6 million as of June 30, 2020 from $5,273.1 million as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to the revenue decline and changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by approximately 1.0 day from December 31, 2019 due to unfavorable mix changes, as a higher percentage of our consolidated revenues consisted of countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with an average days sales outstanding of between 55 and 60 days based on the markets where we do business. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. 36 Conversely, as the demand for our services declines , as we saw starting in late March and continuing th r ough the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. During the second quarter of 2020, we were highly successful in receivable collections while incurring lower payroll costs on lower activity. Our improved cash flow also benefited from certain government payment deferral measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis. The impact of these benefit s is expected to mature in the second half of the year and we expect lower levels of operating cash flow during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Capital expenditures were $18.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $24.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The lower expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to overall scale-back of activities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis and the completion of a software development project in 2019, as well as the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $1.7 million, which represents a deferred consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $212.7 million as of June 30, 2019 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $154.4 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The total cash impact of the acquisition was an inflow of $104.8 million , net of cash acquired of $317.5 million . The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million , $32.5 million represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. Excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $17.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This balance represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $12.9 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. Net debt repayments was $16.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to cash provided by net borrowings of $4.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of June 30, 2020, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of June 30, 2020. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we 37 had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.03 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3. 88 to 1 as of June 30, 2020 . Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of June 30, 2020 and for the near future. As of June 30, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,438.6 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600 million of additional cash, which remains unused as of June 30, 2020, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300 million ($600 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $250.7 million was available to use as of June 30, 2020. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $1,005.5 million as of June 30, 2020 mature in 2022 and 2026, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $1.09 per share on both May 8, 2020 and May 10, 2019. The 2020 dividends were paid on June 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2020. The 2019 dividends were paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $63.8 million. The repurchases in the first half of 2020 all occurred within the first quarter of 2020. During the first six months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $ 101.0 million under the 2018 authorization. As of June 30, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,148.5 million as of June 30, 2020 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,202.8 million as of December 31, 2019. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling approximately $902.6 million and $845.0 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively ($851.0 million and $793.4 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both dates). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recorded net restructuring costs of $48.2 million and $ 41.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $8.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of June 30, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $32.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020. We expect a majority of the remaining $23.4 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2020.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. COVID-19 The global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. Our business, operations and consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, especially in the last few weeks of March as market conditions rapidly deteriorated. By the end of March, significant lockdown measures had been implemented in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. There is considerable uncertainty as to when governmental restrictions in different countries may be lifted, and to what degree individuals and businesses will be permitted to resume economic activity, including the re-opening of workplaces that are restricted. As of the date these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued, governments in some of our key markets such as France, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany still had work-related restrictions in place. We are continuing to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect that our financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations will continue to be adversely affected. However, we cannot predict with certainty what these impacts will be to the remaining quarters of 2020. For further information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results, see Part I, Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable that may not be collected. This allowance is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis with consideration of historical write-off experience, receivables, market conditions, and a specific review for potential bad debts. Items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and the write-off of accounts receivable balances. A rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts is shown below: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 113.5 Provisions charged to earnings 5.2 Write-offs ( 5.5 ) Translation adjustments ( 2.3 ) Reclassifications and other 3.5 Balance, March 31, 2020 $ 114.4 Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 8 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collaterization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payroll Tax Credit In April 2019, we sold a portion of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ). We derecognized these receivables and the additional interest upon the sale date as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment in accordance with the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment tests include; expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. As of the date of our last annual impairment test, performed during the third quarter of 2019, the fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 % in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Germany reporting unit. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote down the carrying value of the Germany reporting unit to its estimated fair value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $ 60.2 million during the second quarter of 2019. Key assumptions included in the Germany discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2019 included a discount rate of 10.8 % and a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2 %. Should the operations of the business incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, some or all of the recorded goodwill, which was $ 65.6 million as of March 31, 2020, could be subject to impairment. We have experienced declines in the operating results of our reporting units in addition to our Germany reporting unit during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy; however, as of the end of the quarter and the date of this filing, we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are below their carrying value. However, given the uncertainty of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period and we may be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment assessment, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 9 (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2020 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable loss has been incurred. The new guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance on income taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions to the general income tax accounting principles, and clarifies and amends existing guidance to facilitate consistent application of the accounting principles. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance on equity method investments. The guidance clarifies the interactions between the existing accounting standards on equity securities, equity method and joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to March 31, 2020, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. 10 Our deferred revenue was $ 38.3 at March 31, 2020 and $ 44.5 at December 31, 2019. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for descriptions of revenue service types. 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 518.7 $ 30.1 $ 25.0 $ 37.1 $ 610.9 $ 528.7 $ 34.9 $ 22.9 $ 36.7 $ 623.2 Other Americas 379.5 12.4 5.5 2.7 400.1 385.4 12.5 5.8 3.3 407.0 898.2 42.5 30.5 39.8 1,011.0 914.1 47.4 28.7 40.0 1,030.2 Southern Europe: France 998.3 78.1 12.5 4.9 1,093.8 1,224.5 58.7 14.5 8.4 1,306.1 Italy 307.1 8.7 8.2 3.7 327.7 330.0 9.8 9.9 6.7 356.4 Other Southern Europe 415.9 90.6 13.9 2.8 523.2 347.0 80.6 14.2 4.5 446.3 1,721.3 177.4 34.6 11.4 1,944.7 1,901.5 149.1 38.6 19.6 2,108.8 Northern Europe 949.6 70.9 31.3 16.7 1,068.5 1,053.4 91.5 38.1 17.5 1,200.5 APME 466.6 83.2 36.9 8.2 594.9 583.4 70.8 43.7 7.5 705.4 Total $ 4,035.7 $ 374.0 $ 133.3 $ 76.1 $ 4,619.1 $ 4,452.4 $ 358.8 $ 149.1 $ 84.6 $ 5,044.9 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by timing of revenue recognition for each of our reportable segments: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 597.8 $ 13.1 $ 610.9 $ 610.2 $ 13.0 $ 623.2 Other Americas 396.5 3.6 400.1 403.0 4.0 407.0 994.3 16.7 1,011.0 1,013.2 17.0 1,030.2 Southern Europe: France 1,082.1 11.7 1,093.8 1,292.4 13.7 1,306.1 Italy 320.0 7.7 327.7 347.1 9.3 356.4 Other Southern Europe 511.5 11.7 523.2 434.4 11.9 446.3 1,913.6 31.1 1,944.7 2,073.9 34.9 2,108.8 Northern Europe 1,041.4 27.1 1,068.5 1,167.4 33.1 1,200.5 APME 575.3 19.6 594.9 677.0 28.4 705.4 Total $ 4,524.6 $ 94.5 $ 4,619.1 $ 4,931.5 $ 113.4 $ 5,044.9 (4) Share-Based Compensation Plans We recognized share-based compensation expense of $ 4.6 for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 10.0 and $ 0.9 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our annual grant of share-based compensation generally takes place during the first quarter of each fiscal year. The number of shares granted to employees and members of our Board of Directors, and the weighted-average fair value per share for shares granted during the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below: 11 For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Fair Value Shares Granted (thousands) Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Fair Value Stock Options 156 $ 18.95 163 $ 17.78 Deferred Stock Units 11 97.10 20 64.80 Restricted Stock Units 188 86.47 203 78.90 Performance Share Units 119 85.25 136 77.70 Total Shares Granted 474 $ 64.18 522 $ 58.96 (5) Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid for acquisitions for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 0.6 , which represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 48.2 and $ 39.8 during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $ 8.2 in the first quarter of 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of March 31, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $ 20.4 during the three months ended March 31, 2020. We expect a majority of the remaining $ 35.1 reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 0.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.2 $ — $ — $ 7.3 Severance costs 4.7 11.8 19.3 1.0 0.2 37.0 Office closure and other costs 8.1 1.3 0.2 1.6 — 11.2 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out ( 8.4 ) ( 7.0 ) ( 3.4 ) ( 1.6 ) — ( 20.4 ) Balance, March 31, 2020 $ 4.8 $ 6.8 $ 22.3 $ 1.0 $ 0.2 $ 35.1 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.3 and $ 4.2 as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. (2) France had no restructuring reserve as of both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.3 and $ 1.7 as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 90.2 % for three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 42.8 % for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by low pre-tax earnings due partly to restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2020. In certain countries in which we recorded restructuring costs, we did no t recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to the recognition of valuation allowances against anticipated tax losses. In addition, the French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in the quarter due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a discrete favorable benefit in the quarter resulting from the successful appeal of a non-United States tax ruling. The 90.2 % effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2020 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2020, the French business tax and overall mix of earnings. 12 As of March 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 70.0 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 69.5 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2013 through 2020 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of March 31, 2020, we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Israel and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share – basic and net earnings per share – diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 1.7 $ 53.5 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 58.7 60.6 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — — Effect of other share-based awards 0.3 0.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 59.0 61.0 Net earnings per share - basic $ 0.03 $ 0.88 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 0.03 $ 0.88 There were 0.6 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share – diluted for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,233.1 $ — $ 1,233.1 $ 1,260.1 $ — $ 1,260.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 455.6 $ 378.6 $ 77.0 $ 460.5 $ 375.7 $ 84.8 Other 20.6 13.9 6.7 20.9 13.7 7.2 476.2 392.5 83.7 481.4 389.4 92.0 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 124.5 — 124.5 124.6 — 124.6 176.5 — 176.5 176.6 — 176.6 Total intangible assets $ 652.7 $ 392.5 $ 260.2 $ 658.0 $ 389.4 $ 268.6 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 577.4 as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2020 is expected to be $ 19.4 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2021- $ 15.7 , 2022- $ 12.5 , 2023- $ 9.8 , 2024 - $ 7.6 , 2025- $ 5.7 . 13 Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 535.6 $ 144.8 $ 374.6 $ 79.1 $ 126.0 $ 1,260.1 Currency impact ( 3.7 ) ( 1.7 ) ( 17.7 ) ( 3.9 ) — ( 27.0 ) Balance, March 31, 2020 $ 531.9 $ 143.1 $ 356.9 $ 75.2 $ 126.0 $ 1,233.1 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 490.3 and $ 490.2 as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 67.3 and $ 66.2 as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.6 as of both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisitions of Right Management ($ 62.1 ) and Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ). Jefferson Wells is now part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2020 2019 United States $ 545.7 $ 545.8 Netherlands 107.8 109.5 United Kingdom 91.2 97.3 France 66.2 67.3 Germany 65.6 67.2 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Other reporting units 294.5 310.9 Total goodwill $ 1,233.1 $ 1,260.1 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, Defined Benefit Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost $ 5.1 $ 2.5 $ — $ — Interest cost 2.3 3.1 0.1 0.1 Expected return on assets ( 3.4 ) ( 2.3 ) — — Settlement loss 10.2 — — — Other 0.9 0.5 ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) Total benefit cost (credit) $ 15.1 $ 3.8 $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) During the three months ended March 31, 2020, contributions made to our pension plans were $ 6.0 and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 . During 2020, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 17.4 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. Pension Settlement During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we fully settled our United States Qualified Retirement Plan liability. We purchased annuities of $ 19.2 and settled lump sum payments of $ 3.2 from our United States Qualified Retirement Plan in January and February 2020, respectively. The completion of lump sum payments in February and transfer of remaining participants to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in March triggered final settlement of the plan. Upon settlement of the pension liability, we 14 reclassified the related pension losses of $ 6.6 , net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The total amount of the required payout to plan participants was determined based on employee elections and market conditions at the time of settlement. The remaining plan assets of $ 16.6 which were in excess of the pension liability upon settlement will be utilized to fund future qualified 401(k) plan contributions following the conclusion of the standard PBGC audit. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2020 2019 Foreign currency translation $ ( 345.4 ) $ ( 260.5 ) Translation gain on derivative instruments, net of income taxes of $( 3.7 ) and $( 9.1 ), respectively 23.8 13.1 Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 120.0 ) ( 121.5 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $( 35.4 ) and $( 30.9 ), respectively ( 66.1 ) ( 74.1 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 2.3 and $ 1.6 , respectively 1.9 2.0 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 505.8 ) $ ( 441.0 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 0.6 and $ 1.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Share Repurchases In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $ 63.8 . During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $ 101.0 under the 2018 authorization. As of March 31, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. (12) Interest and Other Expenses Interest and other expenses consisted of the following: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 11.1 $ 10.2 Interest income ( 3.7 ) ( 1.5 ) Foreign exchange loss 3.1 2.9 Miscellaneous expense, net (1) 10.0 0.3 Interest and other expenses $ 20.5 $ 11.9 (1) Miscellaneous expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2020 includes a $ 10.2 pension settlement loss related to one of our United States plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 15 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 440.0 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 546.9 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of March 31, 2020. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 3 Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2020 2019 Euro Notes $ 16.4 $ 22.4 Cross-currency swaps ( 7.5 ) — 16 Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019 we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: (Gain) Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 3 Months Ended March 31, Location of (Gain) Reclassified 3 Months Ended March 31, Instrument 2020 2019 from AOCI into Income 2020 2019 Cross-currency swaps $ 5.7 $ — Interest and other expenses (income), net $ ( 5.7 ) $ — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at March 31, 2020 to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was as follows: Location of Loss Amount of Loss Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 0.2 $ — 17 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Assets March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 16.6 $ 9.7 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets 1.1 — Total instruments $ 17.7 $ 9.7 Liabilities March 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt 986.9 1,002.9 Cross-currency swaps Accrued liabilities — 6.0 Total instruments $ 986.9 $ 1,008.9 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,015.8 and $ 1,062.5 as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 986.9 and $ 1,002.9 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 89.9 and $ 107.3 as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs).

Accordingly, our former reportable segment, Right Management, is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments. All previously reported results have been restated to conform to the current year presentation We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; and APME. The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services, outplacement services, talent management services, and other services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 19 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 610.9 $ 623.2 Other Americas 400.1 407.0 1,011.0 1,030.2 Southern Europe: France 1,093.8 1,306.1 Italy 327.7 356.4 Other Southern Europe 523.2 446.3 1,944.7 2,108.8 Northern Europe 1,068.5 1,200.5 APME 594.9 705.4 Consolidated (b) $ 4,619.1 $ 5,044.9 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 2.3 $ 16.6 Other Americas 14.3 15.2 16.6 31.8 Southern Europe: France 38.0 55.3 Italy 14.2 20.3 Other Southern Europe 0.8 11.0 53.0 86.6 Northern Europe ( 14.1 ) 1.9 APME 16.9 20.6 72.4 140.9 Corporate expenses ( 27.8 ) ( 27.9 ) Intangible asset amortization expense ( 6.9 ) ( 7.5 ) Operating profit 37.7 105.5 Interest and other expenses ( 20.5 ) ( 11.9 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 17.2 $ 93.6 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.0 and $ 3.6 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 76.5 and $ 156.9 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 3.3 and $ 5.6 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 82.3 and $ 243.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 20 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 29 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency.

Business Overview Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the first quarter of 2020, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. Our first quarter results were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, especially in the last few weeks of March as market conditions rapidly deteriorated. By the end of March, significant lockdown measures had been implemented in our main markets in Europe and North America, as well as in certain other countries. There is considerable uncertainty as to when governmental restrictions in different countries may be lifted, and to what degree individuals and businesses will be permitted to resume economic activity, including the re-opening of workplaces that are restricted. We expect our short-term results will be heavily impacted by the timing of such activities, which are impossible to predict. As of the date of this filing, governments in some of our key markets such as France, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany still had work-related restrictions in place. During the first quarter of 2020, the United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets having an unfavorable impact on our reported results. This strengthening was particularly pronounced against the Euro. Our reported revenues from services decreased 8.4% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 and our reported operating profit decreased 64.2%. These results were partly impacted by the relative weakness of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to the same period in 2019, and generally may understate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 2.5% unfavorable impact on revenues from services, a 1.5% unfavorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.03 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, our businesses experienced significant changes in revenue trends from the previous quarter reflecting the sudden drop of activity during March as our largest markets experienced COVID-19 related work restrictions. Our consolidated revenues were down 5.9% year-over-year in constant currency in the quarter, a decline from the 1.8% year-over-year 21 constant currency decrease in the fourth quarter of 20 19. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency revenue year-over-year decrease was 7.1% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a 1.5% decrease in the fourth quarter of 2019. A majority of the year-over-year revenue decline in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by our Europe an markets during the last two weeks of March as governments issued states of emergency and related lockdown requirements . We experienced a 13.2% decrease (-10.7% in constant currency and -6.2% in organic constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business in the quarter as a result of the COVID-19 disruption in March. Our Talent Solutions business, which includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), TAPFIN - Managed Service Provider (MSP) and our Right Management offerings, experienced growth in the quarter, which was driven by MSP and RPO activity in the first two months of the quarter. We experienced a sharp reduction in RPO activity during March as many client programs initiated hiring freezes due to the COVID 19 crisis. Our Right Management business also experienced a decline in organic constant currency during the quarter. Although Right Management has historically experienced an increase in outplacement activity during economic downturns, we are not seeing an increase in outplacement activity at this time as we believe clients are uncertain as to the duration of the downturn. During the first quarter of 2020, several key markets within Southern and Northern Europe continued to experience revenue declines worsened by the COVID-19 crisis in March, partially offset by continued constant currency revenue increases in certain markets within the Americas and APME despite the volatile and uncertain global economic environment. We experienced a revenue decrease in organic constant currency in Southern Europe, mainly due to revenue declines in France and Italy. After adjusting for billing days, we experienced a revenue decrease in Northern Europe due to the declines in all of our key markets as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and reduced demand from the manufacturing sector in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency decrease in the Americas was 1.8% due to a decrease in the United States related to the COVID-19 crisis in March, partially offset by increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within Other Americas. After adjusting for billing days, revenues in organic constant currency were flat in APME as the increase in Japan due to an increase in Manpower staffing revenues was offset by the revenue decrease in Australia due to our decision to exit certain businesses with low-margins to improve profitability and the COVID-19 crisis in March. Our gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 decreased due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business as a result of the COVID-19 disruption in March and the margin decrease in our Talent Based Outsourcing business. These decreases were partially offset by an improvement in our staffing/interim margin due to increases in a few countries within Southern Europe and APME, which were partially offset by higher sickness and absenteeism in certain countries as well as increased direct costs associated with early termination of client contracts during the COVID-19 crisis in March. We anticipate an ongoing material decline in our higher-margin permanent recruitment business during the duration of government-guided lockdowns in most of our markets as the COVID-19 crisis continues into the second quarter of 2020. We recorded $48.2 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2020, comprised of $12.8 million in the Americas, $13.1 million in Southern Europe, $19.5 million in Northern Europe, $2.6 million in APME, and $0.2 million in corporate expenses. The restructuring costs were primarily related to our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities. We expect to recover the restructuring costs through cost savings over the next 12 months with full run-rate savings beginning in the third quarter of 2020. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the ability of the business to grow in the future and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. Our operating profit decreased 64.2% in the first quarter of 2020 (62.7% in constant currency; 62.8% in organic constant currency) while our operating profit margin decreased 130 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of both 2020 and 2019, our operating profit was down 38.6% in constant currency while operating profit margin was down 100 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating profit margin reflects the significant deleveraging that accompanied the sudden decrease in revenues during March. We have taken significant actions in late March and early April, which we believe will allow us to reduce selling and administrative expenses to further offset the significant gross profit declines that we anticipate in the second quarter of 2020. This includes leveraging government unemployment related benefits, which allowed us to move unutilized staff and associates quickly onto these programs. This also includes the short-term action of cutting discretionary costs and scaling operations back. In addition to these implemented initiatives, we are prepared to take further cost actions to optimize our business structure through this economic downturn with the 22 intention of simultaneously preserving our ability to rebound when market conditions improve. We are focused on managing costs as efficiently as possible in the short-term while continu ing to progress transformational actions aligned with our strategic priorities. As we manage through this crisis and prepare our business for future opportunities we would also like to emphasize the following points: • Many of our leaders have experience managing through economic downturns, and many of our senior operational leaders previously managed parts of our business during the economic downturn in 2008-2009. We believe this is valuable experience for the current economic environment. Additionally, we have enhanced our enterprise risk management framework in recent years, and we have business continuity plans which have been executed at a global, regional and country level. We did this while preserving our operating profit margin as much as possible in the first quarter while creating plans for a very challenging second quarter. • The technology investments we have been making for the last few years as part of our transformational activities have facilitated a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis. In a matter of 10 days in March we were able to shift more than 80% of our people to remote working while mitigating potential productivity losses. We have also extended our cyber and information security capability to accelerate the ability for some of our associates and consultants to work for our clients at home mitigating potential operational or financial losses. • Our business is benefitted by our diversification across geographies, industries, and offerings, as some businesses have not been impacted materially by the crisis at this stage. We have a large portion of our business dedicated to professional services and Talent Solutions. We have seen much smaller declines within our Experis business compared to the Manpower business in March. Additionally, portions of our Talent Solutions business are assisting our clients through this downturn with customized solutions. Although we have seen a decline in hiring activity from some of our major RPO clients as expected in the current environment, we are finding select opportunities elsewhere. Right Management has not yet seen a significant increase in outplacement activity, which we take as an indication that our clients are uncertain as to the duration of this downturn. Operating Results - Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 4,619.1 $ 5,044.9 (8.4 )% (5.9 )% Cost of services 3,895.1 4,240.1 (8.1 )% (5.5 )% Gross profit 724.0 804.8 (10.0 )% (7.7 )% Gross profit margin 15.7 % 16.0 % Selling and administrative expenses 686.3 699.3 (1.9 )% 0.6 % Operating profit 37.7 105.5 (64.2 )% (62.7 )% Operating profit margin 0.8 % 2.1 % Interest and other expenses, net 20.5 11.9 73.3 % Earnings before income taxes 17.2 93.6 (81.6 )% (80.1 )% Provision for income taxes 15.5 40.1 (61.2 )% Effective income tax rate 90.2 % 42.8 % Net earnings $ 1.7 $ 53.5 (96.8 )% (96.0 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 0.03 $ 0.88 (96.6 )% (95.5 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 59.0 61.0 (3.2 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 8.4% (-5.9% in constant currency and -6.0% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 7.8% (-5.5% in constant currency; -9.8% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 16.2% (-13.7% in constant currency), which was primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower staffing services and a 13.2% decrease (-10.5% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. The decrease also includes a decrease in Italy of 8.0% (-5.3% in constant 23 currency), which was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 16.9% decrease (-14.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. The se de crease s w ere partially offset by the additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland in April 2019 ; • decreased demand for services in most of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 11.0% (-7.9% in constant currency and -7.5% in organic constant currency), primarily due to a decrease in our Manpower business and a 16.1% decrease (-13.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordics, and Belgium of 2.1%, 17.2%, 19.3%, 16.7% and 18.6% (-0.3%, -14.7%, -16.9%, -10.4%, and -16.2%, respectively, in constant currency; -8.6% in organic constant currency in the Nordics); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 2.0% (-4.8% on an organic basis) primarily driven by a decline in demand for our Manpower staffing services due mostly do the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by an increase in our Talent Solutions business, primarily within our MSP and RPO offerings; • a revenue decrease in APME of 15.7% (-14.0% in constant currency; increase of 1.2% in organic constant currency) due to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019 (the “Deconsolidation”), partially offset by an increase in demand for our Talent-Based Outsourcing services within the Manpower business; and • a 2.5% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • the 1.1% favorable impact of approximately one more billing day. The year-over-year 30 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 13.2% (-10.7% in constant currency and -6.2% in organic constant currency); and • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact due to the margin decrease in our Talent Based Outsourcing business; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from an improvement in our staffing/interim margin due to increases in a few markets within Southern Europe and APME, partially offset by higher sickness and absenteeism in certain countries as well as increased direct costs associated with early termination of client contracts during the COVID-19 crisis in March. The 1.9% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2020 (increases of 0.6% in constant currency and 1.1% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 2.5% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; • the reduction in recurring selling and administrative costs of $17.0 million as a result of the Deconsolidation in July 2019; • a 9.3% decrease (-7.1% in constant currency and -5.7% in organic constant currency) in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in most markets; partially offset by • restructuring costs of $48.2 million incurred in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $39.8 million incurred in the first quarter of 2019; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $12.8 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe and franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019; and • a bad debt expense and a state sales tax related charge of $4 million incurred in the first quarter of 2020 in the United States. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to: 24 • a 70 basis point un favorable impact from expense deleveraging, excluding restructuring costs, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline ; • a 30 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from acquisitions and dispositions. Interest and other expenses is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses was $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net interest expense decreased $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $7.4 million from $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to the net interest income incurred as a result of cross-currency swaps related to investment hedges and intercompany lending activities. Miscellaneous expense increased to $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to the pension settlement expense of $10.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 90.2% for three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to an effective rate of 42.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The 2020 rate was unfavorably impacted by low pre-tax earnings due partly to restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2020. In certain countries in which we recorded restructuring costs, we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to the recognition of valuation allowances against anticipated tax losses. In addition, the French business tax had a more significant unfavorable impact in the quarter due to French pre-tax earnings decreasing at a greater rate than revenues, which is the primary basis for the tax calculation. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a discrete favorable benefit in the quarter resulting from the successful appeal of a non-United States tax ruling. The 90.2% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2020 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2020, the French business tax and overall mix of earnings. We compute our quarterly effective tax rate in part based upon an estimate of projected annual earnings before income taxes. Given the uncertainty in predicting future earnings before income taxes due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the impact to the first quarter of 2020 along with future quarters quarterly effective tax rates may be material. Net earnings per share - diluted was $0.03 and $0.88 in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.68 and $0.51 per share, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pension settlement expense recorded in the first quarter of 2020 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.11, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2020. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 59.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 from 61.0 million in the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first quarter of 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the first quarter of 2019. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.9% (increase of 1.2% in constant currency; -0.5% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 2.0% (-4.8% on an organic basis) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in March, with the impacts becoming more significant as we ended the quarter. This decrease in the United States was partially offset by an increase in our Talent Solutions business, primarily within our RPO and MSP offerings in January and February, increased demand for our Experis interim services, mostly in January and February, and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day. Our RPO business in the United States has experienced significant client hiring freezes in late March as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.7% (increase of 6.1% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue growth in Canada and Peru of 7.5% and 25 10.5%, respectively (8.5%, and 13.0%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil of 3.4%, 5.2%, 11.7% and 24.0%, respectively (-0.3%, increase of 49.5%, -0.9% and -10.5%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. In April 2020, the United States has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 20%. It is uncertain when COVID-19 related restrictions will be lifted in different parts of the United States, and how those developments will impact our revenue trends. Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Gross profit margin decreased due to a decline in the staffing/interim gross profit margins within certain markets within Other Americas as a result of business mix changes, with higher growth coming from clients with low margins. This decrease was partially offset by the increases in our higher margin RPO and MSP offerings and slight increase in the staffing/interim margin in the United States. In the first quarter of 2020, selling and administrative expenses increased 6.0% (8.3% in constant currency and 6.9% in organic constant currency) due primarily to the increase in restructuring costs to $12.8 million from $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2019, the additional recurring selling and administrative costs incurred as a result of the franchise acquisitions in the United States in August and October 2019, the bad debt expense and a state sales tax related charge incurred in the first quarter of 2020, and increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount to support increases in revenues in certain markets within Other Americas. The majority of our restructuring costs related to the United States where we consolidated branches and other facilities and optimized front and back office processes, and the remaining amount related to Canada and other countries in Other Americas where we continue to simplify our operations. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 1.6% and 3.1% for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2020 from 2.7% in 2019. The margin decrease in the first quarter of 2020 in the United States was primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs, the bad debt expense and a state sales tax related charge incurred in the first quarter of 2020, and the increase in selling and administrative expenses while our revenues decreased, which reflected the significant expense deleveraging due to the sudden impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. These decreases were partially offset by the improvement in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.6% in the first quarter of 2020 from 3.7% in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to the decrease in the gross profit margin, partially offset by our ability to decrease selling and administrative expenses more than the revenue decline. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased 7.8% (-5.5% in constant currency and -9.8% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, revenues from services decreased 16.2% (-13.7% in constant currency) in France (which represents 56% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 8.0% (-5.3% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 17% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 13.2% decrease (-10.5% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment busines s, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day . The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 16.9% decrease (-14.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business, both due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 17.2% (18.3% in constant currency; decrease of -2.0% in organic constant currency) during the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, due to the additional revenue from our acquisition in April 2019 of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland (which represents approximately 5% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day, partially offset by the decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 1.0% (increase of 0.2% in constant currency; -11.9% in organic constant currency). In April 2020, France has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 60%. In mid-April, the French government announced that their COVID-19 restrictions are extended through May 11th. We believe that any improvement in the rate of revenue decline would be dependent on the timing and the nature of the government’s actions to ease the lockdown requirements. In April 2020, Italy has experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 40%. The Italian government imposed additional significant restrictions in late March with broader restrictions that were extended to and ended May 3 rd , with a majority of businesses opening on May 4 th . 26 Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the 9.7% decrease (-7.6% in constant currency and -12.0% in organic constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business and a decrease in the staffing/interim gross profit margin in Italy, partially offset by improvements in staffing/interim margins in France and certain countries within Other Southern Europe. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.1% (4.5% in constant currency; decrease of -0.8% in organic constant currency) during the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, due to the additional recurring costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland and an increase in restructuring costs to $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by the decrease in variable incentive costs due to a decline in profitability in certain markets. The restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2020 related to a reduction of our less profitable call center operations in Portugal, front office centralization and organizational simplification in Spain, front office delivery changes and back office optimization in Italy and Switzerland, and simplification of our Israel and eastern European operations. We have taken significant actions in France in March and April to reduce our costs during this period of materially reduced revenues. In France, we have transitioned approximately 30% of our full-time equivalents to government temporary unemployment programs and other initiatives and have eliminated a significant amount of discretionary spend. We expect these actions to significantly reduce France’s selling and administrative expenses in April as we manage through the COVID-19 crisis. In Italy, we have taken significant actions to reduce costs during this crisis, which also involves transitioning full-time employees onto temporary unemployment programs. These actions along with the benefits of the restructuring actions should allow our Italian business to significantly reduce selling and administrative expenses in April. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 2.7% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 4.1% for 2019. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 3.5% for the first quarter of 2020 from 4.2% in 2019, primarily due to expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline due to the sudden impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March, partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 4.3% for the first quarter of 2020 from 5.7% for 2019, primarily due to the decrease in the gross profit margin and expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring costs, at the same rate as our revenue decline due to the sudden impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 0.2% for the first quarter of 2020 from 2.5% in 2019, due to the increase in restructuring costs to $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 and a decrease in the gross profit margin. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 36%, 17%, 20%, 11%, and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 11.0% (-7.9% in constant currency and -7.5% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 2.1%, 17.2%, 16.7%, 19.3% and 18.6% (-0.3%, -14.7%, -10.4%, -16.9% and -16.2%, respectively, in constant currency; -8.6% in organic constant currency in the Nordics). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March and reduced demand from the manufacturing sector in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The decrease was also due to a 16.1% decrease (-13.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. These decreases were partially offset by an increased demand for our Experis interim services in the United Kingdom, mostly in January and February. In April 2020, our United Kingdom business experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 20% with the United Kingdom government imposing COVID-19 restrictions that are still in place as of the date of this filing, with the government set to make an announcement on the possible easing of the restrictions on May 10 th . In Germany, we experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 35% in April 2020 with the German government gradually lifting certain provisions of their lockdown starting on May 4 th . Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of higher sickness and absenteeism as well as increased direct costs associated with early termination of client contracts during the COVID-19 crisis in March in certain countries, and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business. 27 Selling and administrative expenses decreased 7.6% (-4.3% in constant currency and -3.6% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount in certain countries and a decrease in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in restructuring costs to $19.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. The restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2020 related to a reduction of finance and shared services back office costs in Germany, and simplifying operations in the Nordics, the Netherlands, and Belgium. OUP margin for Northern Europe for the first quarter of 2020 decreased to -1.3% compared to 0.2% in 2019 due to the decrease in gross profit margin, the increase in restructuring costs, and expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring costs, at the same rate as the revenue decline due to the sudden impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. As Germany is a bench market, which means our temporary workers are staffed as full-time employees for which we absorb the cost of unutilized time and sickness, our ability to utilize government unemployment benefits for our bench associates and full-time employees is critical to being able to preserve gross margin and minimize operating losses in the current environment. The German program is subject to certain conditions and is providing between approximately 60% to 70% of lost after tax wages due to the COVID-19 crisis. We anticipate that this program will allow us to avoid absorbing substantial levels of unutilized bench costs to preserve gross margin. Sweden and Norway are also bench markets and there are government programs for unemployment benefits for our bench associates and full-time employees. We expect these programs will allow us to minimize the impact of gross profit margin decline and significantly reduce selling and administrative expenses in Sweden and Norway with the anticipated declines in revenue. Netherlands also has significant bench components and current government programs will also be utilized to compensate for wages pertaining to bench associates as well as our full-time employees running operations. APME Revenues from services decreased 15.7% (-14.0% in constant currency and an increase of 1.2% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. In Japan (which represents 43% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 9.7% (8.4% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, a 4.7% increase (3.6% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, and an increase in our Talent Solutions business. In Australia (which represents 16% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 28.8% (-22.8% in constant currency) due to our decision to exit certain businesses with low-margins to improve profitability, and due to the COVID-19 crisis in March. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the Deconsolidation, partially offset by increased demand for staffing and Talent-Based Outsourcing services within our Manpower business. The government of Japan initiated more restrictive COVID-19 measures in April 2020 in Tokyo and other large districts, which will be in place through May 31. In April 2020, Japan experienced year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 5%, which was negatively impacted as a result of the government restrictions. Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter 2020 compared to 2019 due to the increase in our staffing/interim margin, mostly in Japan, partially offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 28.9% (-25.3% in constant currency and -2.5% in organic constant currency). Selling and administrative expenses decreased 15.0% (-12.8% in constant currency; and increase of 6.0% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of recurring selling and administrative costs as a result of the Deconsolidation and the decrease in restructuring costs to $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $4.4 in the first quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs to support the increases in revenues in certain markets. The restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2020 related to Australia where we continue to simplify the business after exiting certain low-margin clients. OUP margin for APME was 2.9% in both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 as the decrease in restructuring costs and gross profit margin improvement was offset by expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring costs, at the same rate as the revenue decline due to the sudden impact of the COVID-19 crisis in March. 28 Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2020 Compared to 2019 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States 610.9 (2.0 )% — (2.0 )% 2.8 % (4.8 )% Other Americas 400.1 (1.7 )% (7.8 )% 6.1 % — 6.1 % 1,011.0 (1.9 )% (3.1 )% 1.2 % 1.7 % (0.5 )% Southern Europe: France 1,093.8 (16.2 )% (2.5 )% (13.7 )% — (13.7 )% Italy 327.7 (8.0 )% (2.7 )% (5.3 )% — (5.3 )% Other Southern Europe 523.2 17.2 % (1.1 )% 18.3 % 20.3 % (2.0 )% 1,944.7 (7.8 )% (2.3 )% (5.5 )% 4.3 % (9.8 )% Northern Europe 1,068.5 (11.0 )% (3.1 )% (7.9 )% (0.4 )% (7.5 )% APME 594.9 (15.7 )% (1.7 )% (14.0 )% (15.2 )% 1.2 % Consolidated 4,619.1 (8.4 )% (2.5 )% (5.9 )% 0.1 % (6.0 )% Gross Profit 724.0 (10.0 )% (2.3 )% (7.7 )% (0.6 )% (7.1 )% Selling and Administrative Expenses 686.3 (1.9 )% (2.5 )% 0.6 % (0.5 )% 1.1 % Operating Profit 37.7 (64.2 )% (1.5 )% (62.7 )% 0.1 % (62.8 )% (a) In millions for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and 29 monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of March 31, 2020 , we had $990.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $181.0 million and $101.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $155.9 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $18.1 million of cash generated during the three months ended March 31, 2019. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments. Accounts receivable decreased to $4,748.5 million as of March 31, 2020 from $5,273.1 million as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to the revenue decline and changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by approximately 2.0 days from December 31, 2019 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with an average days sales outstanding of between 55 and 60 days based on the markets where we do business. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. Conversely, as the demand for our services declines as we saw in the second half of March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. We do expect a similar underlying trend of increased operating cash flows through the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, if we experience consistent client payment patterns. In April 2020, we have not experienced a significant decrease in cash collections from clients. We will continue to monitor default risks and we intend to staff our collection teams appropriately to diligently pursue payments as per original payment terms. Many governments in countries and territories in which we do business have announced that certain payroll, income, and other tax payments may be deferred without penalty for a certain period of time. These governments have also provided other cash flow related relief packages. As part of our working capital strategy to improve our cash flow needs in the short-term, especially in the next three to six months, we have been actively monitoring these relief packages to take advantage of them. Capital expenditures were $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $10.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. No cash consideration was paid for acquisitions for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $0.6 million, which represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. Net debt repayments was $9.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to cash provided by net borrowings of $2.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. 30 As of March 31, 2020 , we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of March 31, 2020 . The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.48 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.69 to 1 as of March 31, 2020. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of March 31, 2020, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $326.3 million, of which $269.8 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $243.5 million could have been made under these lines as of March 31, 2020. We have assessed what impact the COVID-19 crisis has had or may have on our liquidity position as of March 31, 2020 and for the very near future. As of March 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,099.5 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could immediately provide us with up to $600 million of additional cash, which remains unused as of March 31, 2020. We also have access to the previously mentioned credit lines of up to $300 million ($600 million in the third quarter) to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which $243.5 million was available to use as of March 31, 2020. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes that total $986.9 million as of March 31, 2020, mature in 2022 and 2026, thus, there are no payments due in the very near term except for annual interest payments. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the very near future should the COVID-19 crisis cause any additional cash flow needs. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares comprised of 0.8 million shares under the 2018 authorization and 0.1 million shares under the 2019 authorization, at a total cost of $63.8 million. During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $ 101.0 million under the 2018 authorization. As of March 31, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,167.1 million as of March 31, 2020 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,202.8 million as of December 31, 2019. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling approximately $823.0 million and $845.0 million as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively ($771.4 million and $793.4 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both dates). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers’ compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recorded net restructuring costs of $48.2 million and $ 39.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on leases as of January 1, 2019, the office closure costs of $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 were recorded as an impairment to the operating lease right-of-use asset and, thus, are not included in the restructuring reserve balance as of March 31, 2020. The costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve were $20.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. We expect a majority of the remaining $35.1 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2020. 31 Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain disclosures about market risks affecting us. There have been no material changes to the information provided which would require additional disclosures as of the date of this filing. Item 4 – Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding timely disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at a reasonable assurance level pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation discussed above that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1A – Risk Factors The following information supplements the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and future adverse impacts could be material and difficult to predict. The global spread of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. Our business, operations and financial results have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and by related government actions (including declared states of emergency and quarantine, “shelter in place” or similar orders), non-governmental agency recommendations and public perceptions, all of which have led to disruption in global economic and labor market conditions. These effects have had a significant impact on our business, including reduced demand for our services, early terminations of client contracts and client hiring freezes, and a shift of a majority of our workforce to remote operations, all of which have contributed to a decline in revenues and other adverse impacts on our financial results. Other potential impacts of the spread of COVID-19 include continued or expanded closures of our clients’ facilities, the possibility our clients will not be able to pay for our services and solutions, or that they will attempt to defer payments owed to us, any of which could impact our liquidity, the possibility that the uncertain nature of the pandemic may not yield the increase in outplacement-related programs that we have historically observed during periods of economic downturn, and the possibility that various government-sponsored programs to provide economic relief will be inadequate. Further, we may continue to experience adverse financial impacts if we cannot offset revenue declines with cost savings through expense-related initiatives, human capital management initiatives or otherwise. As a result of these observed and potential developments, we expect our business, operations and financial results to continue to be negatively affected. In particular, a number of our most important European markets, including France and Italy, have been especially impacted to date by COVID-19, and there is a risk that continued deterioration, or a slow eventual recovery, in those and other key markets, including the United States, will have an adverse effect on the labor markets of those jurisdictions and the related demand for our services. We are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic but expect that our business, operations and financial results will continue to be adversely affected. There are numerous uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the extent and duration of travel restrictions and business closures imposed by the governments of impacted countries, and the effects these and other factors have on underlying economic and labor market conditions. As a result, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate effects, which could be material, of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results. 33 Item 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds In August 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 6.0 million shares of our common stock. We conduct share repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. The following table shows the total number of shares repurchased during the first quarter of 2020 under the 2018 and 2019 authorizations. As of March 31, 2020, there were 5.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and no shares remaining authorized to repurchase under the 2018 authorization.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collaterization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payroll Tax Credit In April 2019, we sold a portion of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ). In April 2018, we sold substantially all of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2017 for net proceeds of $ 234.5 (€ 190.9 ). We derecognized these receivables and the additional interest upon the sale date as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment in accordance with the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing an income approach derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. The income approach is developed from management’s forecasted cash flow data. Significant assumptions used in our annual 9 goodwill impairment test included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit (“OUP”) margins, working capital levels, discount rates ranging from 9.9 % to 13.1 % and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and OUP margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and OUP margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. For the second quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included a further downward trend in the performance of the business due to current market conditions, a more cautious outlook for the business stemming from the impact of changes to temporary staffing regulations in Germany, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our Germany deferred tax assets during the second quarter. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2019. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 60.2 during the second quarter of 2019. The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to our New Zealand operations as a result of not meeting profitability expectations. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2019 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued new accounting guidance on leases, ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which we adopted on January 1, 2019. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depend on the classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption. As of the transition date, the ROU asset and total lease liability (current and long-term) were $ 458.1 and $ 458.7 , respectively. We elected the package of three practical expedients which lessened the transitional burden of implementing the new guidance. Accordingly, we did not reassess: 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; or 3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Lastly, we have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on hedge accounting. The amendments in this guidance include the elimination of the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges, recognition and presentation of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, recognition and presentation of components excluded from an entity's hedge effectiveness assessment, addition of the ability to elect to perform subsequent effectiveness assessments qualitatively, and addition of new disclosure requirements. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. There was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the modified disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting comprehensive income. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""Tax Act""). The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2019. We elected not to adopt this optional reclassification. In June 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment awards. The guidance makes the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees la rgely consistent with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. T here was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 10 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable loss has been incurred. The new guidance is effective for us in 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to September 30, 2019, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 36.8 at September 30, 2019 and $ 42.8 at December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to $ 41.5 of revenues recognized related to amounts that were included in the December 31, 2018 balance, partially offset by payments or amounts due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 11 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report on Form10-K for descriptions of revenue service types. 3 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 564.5 $ 33.5 $ 25.2 $ 22.5 $ 645.7 $ 556.1 $ 31.5 $ 23.7 $ 21.9 $ 633.2 Other Americas 404.6 12.5 6.7 1.2 425.0 388.1 11.4 6.1 1.2 406.8 969.1 46.0 31.9 23.7 1,070.7 944.2 42.9 29.8 23.1 1,040.0 Southern Europe: France 1,309.8 56.6 12.1 3.6 1,382.1 1,390.0 53.3 12.7 4.6 1,460.6 Italy 354.9 10.2 8.1 3.4 376.6 386.5 11.5 8.0 4.2 410.2 Other Southern Europe 494.1 82.0 15.4 1.4 592.9 370.2 72.8 13.5 4.3 460.8 2,158.8 148.8 35.6 8.4 2,351.6 2,146.7 137.6 34.2 13.1 2,331.6 Northern Europe 1,037.2 78.0 33.6 7.8 1,156.6 1,138.8 104.3 36.6 7.4 1,287.1 APME 505.3 76.6 36.5 3.5 621.9 582.4 75.4 51.8 3.4 713.0 Right Management — 10.8 — 37.3 48.1 — 12.2 — 34.8 47.0 Total $ 4,670.4 $ 360.2 $ 137.6 $ 80.7 $ 5,248.9 $ 4,812.1 $ 372.4 $ 152.4 $ 81.8 $ 5,418.7 9 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Staffing and Interim Outcome- Based Solutions and Consulting Permanent Recruitment Other Total Americas: United States $ 1,644.5 $ 97.6 $ 72.2 $ 65.9 $ 1,880.2 $ 1,658.4 $ 95.4 $ 69.9 $ 66.3 $ 1,890.0 Other Americas 1,182.8 36.5 18.7 3.2 1,241.2 1,168.6 34.9 18.6 3.0 1,225.1 2,827.3 134.1 90.9 69.1 3,121.4 2,827.0 130.3 88.5 69.3 3,115.1 Southern Europe: France 3,880.0 170.6 40.2 12.9 4,103.7 4,171.4 167.6 42.1 16.0 4,397.1 Italy 1,050.1 31.4 28.7 16.3 1,126.5 1,187.4 35.8 27.4 16.2 1,266.8 Other Southern Europe 1,313.0 245.3 45.6 6.9 1,610.8 1,132.7 227.1 42.1 11.8 1,413.7 6,243.1 447.3 114.5 36.1 6,841.0 6,491.5 430.5 111.6 44.0 7,077.6 Northern Europe 3,141.4 254.2 109.9 24.0 3,529.5 3,628.0 320.2 126.1 23.6 4,097.9 APME 1,670.7 219.5 130.3 10.2 2,030.7 1,781.1 212.8 152.8 11.3 2,158.0 Right Management — 33.2 — 111.1 144.3 — 36.2 — 113.2 149.4 Total $ 13,882.5 $ 1,088.3 $ 445.6 $ 250.5 $ 15,666.9 $ 14,727.6 $ 1,130.0 $ 479.0 $ 261.4 $ 16,598.0 12 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by timing of revenue recognition for each of our reportable segments: 3 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 632.1 $ 13.6 $ 645.7 $ 620.4 $ 12.8 $ 633.2 Other Americas 420.4 4.6 425.0 402.2 4.6 406.8 1,052.5 18.2 1,070.7 1,022.6 17.4 1,040.0 Southern Europe: France 1,370.8 11.3 1,382.1 1,448.5 12.1 1,460.6 Italy 369.3 7.3 376.6 402.8 7.4 410.2 Other Southern Europe 580.1 12.8 592.9 449.7 11.1 460.8 2,320.2 31.4 2,351.6 2,301.0 30.6 2,331.6 Northern Europe 1,127.4 29.2 1,156.6 1,255.9 31.2 1,287.1 APME 600.3 21.6 621.9 678.0 35.0 713.0 Right Management 48.1 - 48.1 47.0 - 47.0 Total $ 5,148.5 $ 100.4 $ 5,248.9 $ 5,304.5 $ 114.2 $ 5,418.7 9 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Services transferred over time Services transferred at a point in time Total Americas: United States $ 1,839.9 $ 40.3 $ 1,880.2 $ 1,851.5 $ 38.5 $ 1,890.0 Other Americas 1,228.3 12.9 1,241.2 1,212.0 13.1 1,225.1 3,068.2 53.2 3,121.4 3,063.5 51.6 3,115.1 Southern Europe: France 4,066.0 37.7 4,103.7 4,356.6 40.5 4,397.1 Italy 1,100.0 26.5 1,126.5 1,241.2 25.6 1,266.8 Other Southern Europe 1,572.9 37.9 1,610.8 1,378.3 35.4 1,413.7 6,738.9 102.1 6,841.0 6,976.1 101.5 7,077.6 Northern Europe 3,433.9 95.6 3,529.5 3,989.9 108.0 4,097.9 APME 1,947.4 83.3 2,030.7 2,056.4 101.6 2,158.0 Right Management 144.3 - 144.3 149.4 - 149.4 Total $ 15,332.7 $ 334.2 $ 15,666.9 $ 16,235.3 $ 362.7 $ 16,598.0 (4) Share-Based Compensation Plans For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $ 5.9 and $ 6.7 , respectively, and $ 18.8 and $ 19.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 6.3 and $ 4.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (5) Acquisitions and Dispositions Switzerland Acquisitions On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 219.5 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 161.2 was for cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate cash consideration paid reflects a post-closing settlement of net debt and net working capital adjustments of $ 6.8 , which we paid out during the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. 13 Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income) , net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. T he acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination , and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date . The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $ 415.1 , or $ 97.6 net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 80.4 , $ 32.5 represented foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest from accumulated other comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date of April 3, 2019: Cash and cash equivalents $ 317.5 Accounts receivable 60.4 Prepaid expenses and other assets 31.4 Goodwill 33.8 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 19.6 Intangible assets not subject to amortization, reacquired franchise rights 25.5 Property and equipment 0.4 Accounts payable ( 21.6 ) Employee compensation payable ( 2.5 ) Accrued liabilities ( 9.9 ) Accrued payroll taxes and insurance ( 7.5 ) Value added taxes payable ( 7.4 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 24.6 ) Total assets acquired, and liabilities assumed $ 415.1 The amounts in the above table represent the preliminary allocation of purchase price and are subject to revision when valuations are finalized for intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2019. The customer relationship intangible asset is expected to be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The goodwill from the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Manpower Switzerland contributed net revenues from services of $ 227.8 since the acquisition. Our consolidated unaudited proforma historical net revenues from services, as if Manpower Switzerland had been acquired at the beginning of 2018, are estimated as follows: 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net revenues from services $ 5,248.9 $ 5,552.4 $ 15,765.5 $ 16,950.1 Other Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, was $ 39.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The balance includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 13.0 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the total cash consideration for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 50.9 , the majority of which took place in the Netherlands. This balance includes initial acquisition payments of $ 8.2 and contingent consideration payments of $ 42.7 , of which $ 18.6 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. 14 ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited Disposition On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51 % controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25 % of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25 %, and then further diluted to 36.87 % as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $ 30.4 , which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Included in the $ 30.4 was foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $ 6.2 related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive income. (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 42.5 and $ 39.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve was $ 42.5 . We expect a majority of the remaining $ 15.5 reserve will be paid, utilized or transferred out by the end of 2019. Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 0.3 $ 1.7 $ 13.1 $ — $ 0.4 $ — $ 15.5 Severance costs 3.8 5.3 17.6 3.5 0.2 2.3 32.7 Office closure costs and other 1.3 0.1 2.2 0.9 4.5 0.8 9.8 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out (3) ( 4.6 ) ( 4.1 ) ( 23.4 ) ( 3.8 ) ( 5.0 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 42.5 ) Balance, September 30, 2019 $ 0.8 $ 3.0 $ 9.5 $ 0.6 $ 0.1 $ 1.5 $ 15.5 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.3 and $ 0.6 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.9 and $ 0.8 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.5 and $ 0.7 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. (3) Restructuring reserve of $ 4.6 was transferred to current operating lease liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 28.6 % for three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 23.0 % for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, partially offset by the favorable impact of the gain from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited disposition, which was non-taxable. The 2018 rate was favorably impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act of 2017 and certain discrete tax benefits. The 28.6 % effective tax rate in the quarter was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax and overall mix of earnings. We recorded income tax expense at the effective rate of 34.5 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 26.3 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The 34.5 % effective tax rate was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of valuation allowances in Germany. 15 As of September 30, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 31.1 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 34.2 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2012 through 2019 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of September 30, 2019, we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share – basic and net earnings per share – diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 146.1 $ 158.0 $ 326.9 $ 398.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 59.9 64.5 60.2 65.6 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Effect of other share-based awards 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 60.3 65.0 60.6 66.1 Net earnings per share - basic $ 2.44 $ 2.45 $ 5.43 $ 6.08 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 2.42 $ 2.43 $ 5.40 $ 6.03 There were 0.4 million and 0.3 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share – diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill(1) $ 1,231.8 $ — $ 1,231.8 $ 1,297.1 $ — $ 1,297.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 458.8 $ 366.8 $ 92.0 $ 444.8 $ 351.7 $ 93.1 Other 18.5 13.4 5.1 18.5 16.0 2.5 477.3 380.2 97.1 463.3 367.7 95.6 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 123.8 — 123.8 98.7 — 98.7 175.8 — 175.8 150.7 — 150.7 Total intangible assets $ 653.1 $ 380.2 $ 272.9 $ 614.0 $ 367.7 $ 246.3 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 577.4 and $ 513.4 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 16 Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2019 is expected to be $ 7.4 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2020- $ 24.7 , 2021- $ 14.2 , 2022- $ 11.0 , 2023- $ 9.2 , 2024- $ 8.0 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 519.9 $ 112.2 $ 435.4 $ 102.0 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,297.1 Goodwill acquired 9.1 33.8 - - - - 42.9 Goodwill allocated to business units sold (4) - - - ( 18.5 ) - ( 1.6 ) ( 20.1 ) Impairment charge (5) - - ( 60.2 ) ( 3.8 ) - - ( 64.0 ) Currency and other impacts 0.9 ( 5.1 ) ( 18.9 ) ( 1.0 ) - - ( 24.1 ) Balance, September 30, 2019 $ 529.9 $ 140.9 $ 356.3 $ 78.7 $ 62.1 $ 63.9 $ 1,231.8 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 476.5 and $ 485.2 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 68.9 and $ 65.5 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.8 and $ 4.5 as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisition of Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ) which is now part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. (4) Reductions relate to our China and Hong Kong reporting units, which were deconsolidated as of July 10, 2019. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (5) The impairment charges of $ 60.2 and $ 3.8 relate to our Germany and New Zealand reporting units, respectively, which were recorded during the second quarter of 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses (income), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 0.2 and $ 1.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 1.3 and $ 3.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The portion of earnings attributed to the noncontrolling interest for ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited is included in the above amounts through July 10, 2019. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the deconsolidation of the entity.) Dividends 18 In 2018, the Board of Directors made the following dividend declarations: On May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $ 1.01 per share which was paid on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018 . On November 9, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $ 1.01 per share which was paid on December 14, 2018 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2018 . To date in 2019, the Board of Directors has made the following dividend declaration: On May 10, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $ 1.09 per share which was paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019 . Share Repurchases In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 and July 2016 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first nine months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.8 million shares at a cost of $ 152.0 under the 2018 authorization. During the first nine months of 2018, we repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares comprised of 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 0.3 million shares under the 2018 authorization, at a total cost of $ 299.2 . As of September 30, 2019, there were 6.0 million and 1.3 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and 2018 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2016 authorization.

Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Net Investment Hedges We use cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as 19 hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the non-derivative financial instrument due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments. The € 400.0 ($ 434.4 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 539.9 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of September 30, 2019. In September 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement that net converts fixed-rate Swiss franc (“CHF”) payments to fixed-rate United States dollar payments. This swap was designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign subsidiary with CHF functional currency. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and 2018 was as follows: Gain Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2019 2018 2019 2018 Euro Notes $ 42.6 $ 7.2 $ 51.1 $ 33.1 Cross-currency swaps 2.8 — 2.8 — Cash Flow Hedges We use cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For our cross-currency swaps, we record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offset the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. In September 2019 we entered into to a cross-currency swap agreement to convert an additional intercompany fixed-rate CHF note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap is identical to the original April 2019 swap, and fixes the principal of € 55.4 with a fixed interest rate of 1.143 %. The swap matures in September 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The following tables present the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and 2018: Gain Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 3 Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain Reclassified 3 Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2019 2018 from AOCI into Income 2019 2018 Cross-currency swaps $ 4.2 $ — Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 4.6 $ — 20 Gain Reclassified Gain Recognized in OCI from AOCI into Income 9 Months Ended September 30, Location of Gain Reclassified 9 Months Ended September 30, Instrument 2019 2018 from AOCI into Income 2019 2018 Cross-currency swaps $ 9.2 $ — Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 10.0 $ — We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains and losses included in AOCI at September 30, 2019 to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other expenses (income), net $ 4.6 $ — $ 13.8 $ 2.0 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018: Assets September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 9.0 $ — Instruments designated as net investment: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets 2.8 — Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net 0.1 0.1 Total instruments $ 11.9 $ 0.1 Liabilities September 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as net investment hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt 1,045.7 1,052.9 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities — 0.1 Total instruments $ 1,045.7 $ 1,053.0 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,045.7 and $ 1,052.9 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 974.3 and $ 1,024.6 , respectively. 21 Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 101.4 and $ 89.5 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). (14) Leases We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 12 years. Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. We have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. That is, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of September 30, 2019, we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The components of lease expense were as follows: 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended September 30, 2019 September 30, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 36.4 $ 106.1 Short-term lease expense 3.5 15.6 Other lease expense (1) $ 2.6 $ 12.5 Total lease expense $ 42.5 $ 134.2 (1) Other lease expense includes immaterial variable lease expense and sublease income. Other information related to leases was as follows: 9 Months Ended Supplemental Cash Flow Information September 30, 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 109.7 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 88.8 September 30, Supplemental Balance Sheet Information 2019 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 415.6 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 103.5 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 314.1 Total operating lease liabilities $ 417.6 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 22 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 5.7 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 3.2 % Maturities of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019 were as follows: (In millions) Period Ending September 30, 2019 Operating Leases 2019 (excluding the nine months ended September 30, 2019) $ 25.0 2020 116.5 2021 89.5 2022 68.2 2023 46.5 2024 32.9 Thereafter 82.7 Total future undiscounted lease payments $ 461.3 Less imputed interest $ ( 43.7 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 417.6 Maturities of operating leases accounted for under ASC 840 as of December 31, 2018 were as follows: (In millions) Period Ending December 31, 2018 Operating Leases 2019 $ 151.4 2020 115.2 2021 85.5 2022 65.0 2023 44.1 Thereafter 105.6 Total minimum lease payments $ 566.8 (15) Segment Data We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis, with Right Management currently operating as a separate global business unit. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; APME; and Right Management. The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services and other services. The Right Management segment revenues are derived from outplacement and talent management services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 23 3 Months Ended September 30, 9 Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 645.7 $ 633.2 $ 1,880.2 $ 1,890.0 Other Americas 425.0 406.8 1,241.2 1,225.1 1,070.7 1,040.0 3,121.4 3,115.1 Southern Europe: France 1,382.1 1,460.6 4,103.7 4,397.1 Italy 376.6 410.2 1,126.5 1,266.8 Other Southern Europe 592.9 460.8 1,610.8 1,413.7 2,351.6 2,331.6 6,841.0 7,077.6 Northern Europe 1,156.6 1,287.1 3,529.5 4,097.9 APME 621.9 713.0 2,030.7 2,158.0 Right Management 48.1 47.0 144.3 149.4 Consolidated (b) $ 5,248.9 $ 5,418.7 $ 15,666.9 $ 16,598.0 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 35.8 $ 33.2 $ 84.4 $ 98.1 Other Americas 18.9 18.1 51.0 52.8 54.7 51.3 135.4 150.9 Southern Europe: France 70.4 78.8 201.6 209.5 Italy 23.3 25.7 73.5 82.8 Other Southern Europe 22.8 17.1 51.8 48.7 116.5 121.6 326.9 341.0 Northern Europe 21.4 40.5 46.3 81.8 APME (d) 53.3 32.4 101.5 87.5 Right Management 7.5 6.5 18.6 23.4 253.4 252.3 628.7 684.6 Corporate expenses ( 29.2 ) ( 26.3 ) ( 89.0 ) ( 79.0 ) Goodwill impairment charge - - ( 64.0 ) - Intangible asset amortization expense ( 7.2 ) ( 9.3 ) ( 22.4 ) ( 26.8 ) Operating profit 217.0 216.7 453.3 578.8 Interest and other (expenses) income, net (e) ( 12.2 ) ( 11.8 ) 46.1 ( 38.4 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 204.8 $ 204.9 $ 499.4 $ 540.4 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.5 and $ 3.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 10.8 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 151.6 and $ 169.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 462.8 and $ 485.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 4.3 and $ 6.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 14.0 and $ 17.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 274.0 and $ 278.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 680.2 and $ 789.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 24 (d) APME OUP includes a one-time non-cash gain of $ 30.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, related to the deconsolidation of our ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited joint venture. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information . (e) Interest and other (expenses) income, net includes a one-time non-cash gain of $ 80.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, related to the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information . (16) Contingencies Litigation On April 26, 2017, the sellers of 7S, a company we acquired in 2015, formally disputed the contingent consideration related to the acquisition, claiming that they were owed an additional $ 23.7 (€ 20.8 ), plus interest. The dispute was submitted to an arbitration tribunal in Germany. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration forum handed down its decision, rejecting the claims brought by the 7S sellers. Finding in favor of ManpowerGroup, the arbitration tribunal confirmed that no further amounts are owed by us, and also awarded us reimbursement of legal fees and other costs. 25 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on pages 37 and 38 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Business Overview Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increased demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the third quarter of 2019 and in the first nine months of 2019, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. We continued to see significant variation across global labor markets during the third quarter, which is reflected in our results and evidenced by discussions with many of our clients, who note that they are impacted by increased volatility and uncertainty with expectations of slowing economic growth driven by trade-related uncertainty and slowing manufacturing activity, particularly in Europe. At the same time, clients in healthy labor markets are struggling to overcome a shortage of talent with the required skills. During the third quarter of 2019, the United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets than in the third quarter of 2018, having an unfavorable impact on our reported results. This strengthening was particularly pronounced against the Euro and British Pound. Our reported revenues from services decreased 3.1% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and our reported operating profit increased 0.2%. These results were partly impacted by the relative weakness of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to the same period in 2018, and generally may understate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 3.4% unfavorable impact on revenues from services, a 3.1% unfavorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.07 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, our businesses did not experience significant changes in revenue trends from the previous quarter. The environment continued to be one of revenue declines in most of our markets, with slowing economic growth globally and continued tight labor markets in many countries, particularly Europe, that is overshadowing modest constant currency growth elsewhere. Our consolidated revenues were up 0.3% in constant currency in the quarter, an improvement from the 0.1% constant currency decline in the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to incremental growth in the United States and the United Kingdom, and improved trends in Spain and Italy. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency revenue decrease was 0.5% compared to a 0.6% decrease in the second quarter of 2019. During the third quarter of 2019, several key markets within Southern and Northern Europe continued to experience revenue declines, partially offset by continued constant currency revenue increases in certain markets within the Americas and APME. After adjusting for billing days, we experienced a revenue decrease in organic constant currency in Southern Europe due to revenue declines in France and Italy, partially offset by organic constant currency revenue growth in certain markets within Other Southern Europe. The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the decreases in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden due mostly to reduced demand from the manufacturing sector in those markets. In the Americas, revenues increased 5.5% in constant currency due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within Other Americas and the increase in the United States driven by our Experis business. In APME, revenues increased 4.6% in organic constant currency primarily due to an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues. As of the date of this report, we expect that the uneven economic environment trend we saw during the third quarter will continue into the fourth quarter, with certain European labor markets and our European results being sluggish, and improving or flat organic constant currency results in markets within the Americas and APME. Our gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 decreased due to our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, specifically our Talent Based Outsourcing business, comprising a lower percentage of our consolidated revenues in the third 26 quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, a decline in our staffing margin due to declines in most of our markets within Northern Europe, and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business . ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, which operates in the Greater China region of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) on the Hong Kong Stock Market on July 10, 2019, resulting in deconsolidation of the entity. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a non-cash accounting gain of $30.4 million (see further information in Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited’s results through July 10, 2019, were included in our consolidated results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. Our operating profit increased 0.2% in the third quarter of 2019 (3.3% in constant currency; 5.6% in organic constant currency) while our operating profit margin increased 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the gain from the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited recorded in the third quarter 2019 our operating profit was down 10.7% in constant currency while operating profit margin was down 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity, technology and digital capabilities. Operating Results - Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to 2018. (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 5,248.9 $ 5,418.7 (3.1 )% 0.3 % Cost of services 4,408.6 4,528.1 (2.6 )% 0.9 % Gross profit 840.3 890.6 (5.7 )% (2.5 )% Gross profit margin 16.0 % 16.4 % Selling and administrative expenses 623.3 673.9 (7.5 )% (4.4 )% Operating profit 217.0 216.7 0.2 % 3.3 % Operating profit margin 4.1 % 4.0 % Interest and other expenses, net 12.2 11.8 5.2 % Earnings before income taxes 204.8 204.9 (0.1 )% 3.0 % Provision for income taxes 58.7 46.9 24.7 % Effective income tax rate 28.6 % 23.0 % Net earnings $ 146.1 $ 158.0 (7.5 )% (4.7 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 2.42 $ 2.43 (0.4 )% 2.5 % Weighted average shares – diluted 60.3 65.0 (7.1 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 3.1% (increase of 0.3% in constant currency and 0.6% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • decreased demand for services in several of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 10.1% (-5.3% in constant currency and -4.3% in organic constant currency), primarily due to a decrease in our staffing/interim revenues and the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018. We experienced revenue declines in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Nordics of 21.1%, 23.7%, 8.4%, 1.5% and 9.5% (-17.5%, -20.2%, -4.2%, increase of 4.2%, and -3.0%, respectively, in constant currency; -16.4% and -0.8% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands and the Nordics, respectively); • a revenue decrease in APME of 12.8% (-12.6% in constant currency; increase of 4.6% in organic constant currency) due primarily to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019, the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues; and • a 3.4% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by 27 • a revenue increase in Southern Europe of 0.9% ( 5 . 0 % in constant currency; 0.1% in organic constant currency). The increase was primarily due to the additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland in April 2019. This increase was partially offset by a revenue decrease in France of 5.4% (-1.0% in constant currency) primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in Italy of 8.2% (-3.9% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and a decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment, partially offset by a 0.6% increase (5.5% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business; • a revenue increase in the United States of 2.0% (1.3% on an organic basis) primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis interim services as we experienced increased activity from our small-to-medium sized clients, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP and RPO offerings, and additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of three franchises in August 2019. These increases were partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower services due to reduced activity of our manufacturing clients; and • increased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues increased 2.5% (4.7% in constant currency), including a 7.1% increase (9.7% in constant currency) in our outplacement services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease (-9.8% in constant currency) in our talent management business. The year-over-year 40 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact as our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, specifically our Talent Based Outsourcing business, comprised a lower percentage of our consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018; • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from a decrease in our staffing/interim margin due to declines in most of our markets within Northern Europe, partially offset by improvement from pricing initiatives in a few of our largest markets and favorable direct cost adjustments in France; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact due to the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 8.7% (-5.6% in constant currency; increase of 2.5% in organic constant currency). The 7.5% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 (-4.4% in constant currency and -3.2% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • the $30.4 million gain related to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited; • an $18.6 million decrease in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation in July 2019 and dispositions in December 2018 in Northern Europe and APME; • a 2.8% decrease (increase of 0.3% in constant currency and 1.6% in organic constant currency) in personnel costs primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations, particularly within Northern Europe; • an 8.2% decrease (-5.2% in constant currency and -4.5% organic constant currency) in office-related costs primarily due to a decrease in the number of offices as a result of our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations; and • a 3.1% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $10.9 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe and acquisition of three franchises in the United States in late August 2019. 28 Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues de creased 50 basis points in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to the 50 basis point favorable impact from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited d econsolidation gain . Interest and other expenses (income), net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses (income), net was expense of $12.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $11.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. Net interest expense increased $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 to $11.3 million from $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in interest rates and increase in debt in certain countries with high interest rates. Miscellaneous income was $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to miscellaneous expenses of $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. The change was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 28.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 23.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, partially offset by the favorable impact of the gain from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation, which was non-taxable. The 2018 rate was favorably impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act of 2017 and certain discrete tax benefits. The 28.6% effective tax rate in the quarter was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax and our overall mix of earnings. Net earnings per share - diluted was $2.42 and $2.43 in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2019. The gain from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited IPO recorded in the third quarter of 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.50 per share. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 60.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 from 65.0 million in the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the third quarter of 2018. 29 Operating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to 2018. (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 15,666.9 $ 16,598.0 (5.6 )% (0.7 )% Cost of services 13,151.4 13,899.3 (5.4 )% (0.4 )% Gross profit 2,515.5 2,698.7 (6.8 )% (2.2 )% Gross profit margin 16.1 % 16.3 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charge 1,998.2 2,119.9 (5.7 )% (1.1 )% Goodwill impairment charge 64.0 - Selling and administrative expenses 2,062.2 2,119.9 (2.7 )% 2.0 % Operating profit 453.3 578.8 (21.7 )% (17.7 )% Operating profit margin 2.9 % 3.5 % Interest and other (income) expenses, net (46.1 ) 38.4 Earnings before income taxes 499.4 540.4 (7.6 )% (3.6 )% Provision for income taxes 172.5 142.0 21.4 % Effective income tax rate 34.5 % 26.3 % Net earnings $ 326.9 $ 398.4 (17.9 )% (14.5 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 5.40 $ 6.03 (10.4 )% (6.8 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 60.6 66.1 (8.4 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 5.6% (-0.7% in constant currency and -0.8% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • decreased demand for services in several of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 13.9% (-8.0% in constant currency and -7.2% in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services and the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018. We experienced revenue declines in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Nordics of 27.0%, 25.8%, 10.5%, 6.9%, and 8.2% (-22.3%, -21.0%, -4.9%, -1.2%, and -0.1%, respectively, in constant currency; -17.3% and increase of 0.8% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands and the Nordics, respectively); • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 3.3% (increase of 2.4% in constant currency; -0.8% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 6.7% (-0.8% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and a slight decrease in our Manpower staffing revenues, partially offset by increased demand in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and the additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland in April 2019. The Southern Europe decrease also included a decrease in Italy of 11.1% (-5.5% in constant currency) due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by a 4.5% increase (11.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business; • a revenue decrease in the United States of 0.5% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services, partially offset by additional revenues as a result of the acquisition of three franchises in August 2019; • a revenue decrease in APME of 5.9% (-3.1% in constant currency; increase of 5.2% in organic constant currency) due to the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited in July 2019, the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues; 30 • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 3.4 % ( - 0.3 % in constant currency), including a 1.9 % decrease ( increase of 1.2 % in constant currency) in our outplacement services, as well as a n 8.3 % decrease (- 5.4 % in constant currency) in our talent management business; and • a 4.9% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The year-over-year 20 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from the declining margins in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business, particularly within our Talent Based Outsourcing business; and • a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the decrease in our staffing/interim margin due to declines in most of our markets within Northern Europe partially offset by improvement from pricing initiatives in a few of our largest markets and favorable direct cost adjustments in France; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The 2.7% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (increase of 2.0% in constant currency and 2.2% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 7.3% decrease (-2.7% in both constant currency and organic constant currency) in office-related costs primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, a decrease in the number of offices as a result of our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations; • a 4.1% decrease (increase of 0.5% in both constant currency and organic constant currency) in personnel costs primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in headcount to support the increase in revenues in certain markets within the Americas, Southern Europe and APME; • a $26.1 million decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation in July 2019 and dispositions in December 2018 in Northern Europe and APME; partially offset by • goodwill impairment and related charges of $65.6 million related to our Germany reporting unit and New Zealand operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2019; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $23.2 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe and acquisition of three franchises in the United States in late August 2019; and • restructuring costs of $39.8 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $39.3 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 40 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from the goodwill impairment and other related charges, 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs, and a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. These items were partially offset by a 20 basis point favorable impact from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation gain. Interest and other expenses (income), net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses (income), net was income of $46.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to expenses of $38.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Net interest expense decreased $2.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $30.1 million from $33.0 million in the third quarter of 2018 due to the lower interest rate on our €500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Miscellaneous income was $82.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to miscellaneous expense of $2.6 million in the nine months ended 31 September 30, 2018 . The change was primarily due to the gain of $80.4 million from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland and a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the decrease in the income from the equity investment in Switzerland prior to the acquisition. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 34.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 26.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The 34.5% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of valuation allowances in Germany. Net earnings per share - diluted was $5.40 and $6.03 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.22 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.33 per share. Goodwill impairment and related tax and other charges recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.08. The gain from the deconsolidation of ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $0.50 per share. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, restructuring costs negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.52 and $0.45 per share, net of tax. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 60.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from 66.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the nine months ended September 30, 2018, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services increased 2.9% (5.5% in constant currency and 5.1% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In the United States, revenues from services increased 2.0% (1.3% on an organic basis) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by increased demand for our Experis interim services as we experienced increased activity from our small-to-medium sized clients, the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day, a 6.0% increase in our permanent recruitment business, and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP and RPO offerings. These increases were partially offset by decreased demand for our Manpower services due to reduced activity of our manufacturing clients. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 4.5% (11.0% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue growth in Canada and Peru of 19.5% and 24.1%, respectively (20.8%, and 26.0%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil of 1.7%, 16.4%, 3.6% and 2.3%, respectively (increases of 0.8%, 32.2%, 8.8% and decrease of -1.7%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. In the Americas, revenues from services increased 0.2% (3.7% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 0.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 3.1% increase in our permanent recruitment business and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 1.3% (10.2% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, and Peru of 1.9%, 11.3%, and 16.0%, respectively (3.1%, 14.7%, and 18.3%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil of 33.5%, 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively (increases of 21.6%, 10.5% and 7.1%, respectively, in constant currency). 32 Gross profit margin increased in the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 and was flat in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. Gross profit margin increased due to margin improvements in our s taffing/interim business , specifically in the United States , due to pricing discipline and lower payroll tax and insurance costs . G ross profit margin also increased due to the increase of 6 . 9 % ( 8 . 0 % in constant currency) and 2.6% (4.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively . The gross profit margin in crease s in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 w ere offset by the de crease s in the staffing/interim gross profit margins within certain markets within Other Americas . In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, selling and administrative expenses increased 3.0% (4.9% in constant currency) and 3.4% (6.4% in constant currency), respectively, due primarily to an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount related to growth initiatives. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was also due to the increase in restructuring costs to $5.1 million from $0.3 million in the first nine months of 2018. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 5.1% and 4.9% for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin increased to 5.5% in the third quarter of 2019 from 5.2% in 2018. The margin increase in the third quarter of 2019 in the United States was primarily due to the improvement in the gross profit margin, partially offset by increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. Other Americas OUP margin was flat at 4.5% in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 as we were able to increase revenues without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses offset by a decline in the gross profit margin. OUP margin in the Americas was 4.3% and 4.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 4.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 5.2% in 2018. The margin decrease in 2019 in the United States was primarily due to increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives, partially offset by an improvement in the gross profit margin. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 4.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 4.3% in 2018 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs and increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services increased 0.9% (5.0% in constant currency; 0.1% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, revenues from services decreased 5.4% (-1.0% in constant currency) in France (which represents 59% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 8.2% (-3.9% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 16% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business . The decrease in Italy was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment, partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day and a 0.6% increase (5.5% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment busines s. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 28.7% (31.9% in constant currency and 6.9% in organic constant currency) during the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, due to the additional revenue from our acquisition in April 2019 of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland (which represents approximately 5% of Southern Europe’s revenues) increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 15.4% (18.2% in constant currency and 4.9% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Revenues from services decreased 3.3% (increase of 2.4% in constant currency; -0.8% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, revenues from services decreased 6.7% (-0.8% in constant currency) in France and decreased 11.1% (-5.5% in constant currency) in Italy compared to 2018. The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business . The decrease in Italy was due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day and a 4.5% increase (11.2% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from 33 services in creased 13 . 9 % ( 1 9 .4% in constant currency and 3 . 5 % in organic constant currency ) during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 , due to the additional revenue from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland , increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 8 . 1 % ( 13 .9 % in constant currency and 5 . 8 % in organic constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the decrease in France's staffing/interim margin due to the unfavorable impact from transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program, partially offset by various initiatives undertaken to address the unfavorable impact from this transition and the improvement of the staffing/interim gross profit margin in Italy. Gross profit margin increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018, partially due to the favorable direct cost adjustments and various initiatives undertaken to address the unfavorable impact from transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program and the improvement of the staffing/interim gross profit margin in Italy. The Southern Europe gross profit margins also increased due to growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 4.8% and 2.7% increase, respectively (8.8% and 8.9% in constant currency and 3.6% and 5.9% in organic constant currency, respectively) in the permanent recruitment business for the third quarter of 2019 and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.1% (6.2% in constant currency and 1.1% in organic constant currency) during the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, due to the additional recurring costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland and an increase in salary-related expenses as a result of higher headcount, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1.3% (increase of 4.7% in constant currency and 1.2% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018, due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by the additional recurring costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland and an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.0% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 5.2% for 2018. In France, the OUP margin decreased to 5.1% for the third quarter of 2019 from 5.4% in 2018, primarily due to expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline, and the decrease in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 6.2% for the third quarter of 2019 from 6.3% for 2018, primarily due to expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline, partially offset by the improvement in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin increased to 3.8% for the third quarter of 2019 from 3.7% in 2018, as we were able to increase revenues without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in the gross profit margin. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.8% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. In France, the OUP margin increased to 4.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 4.8% in 2018, primarily due improvement in the gross profit margin, partially offset by expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline. In Italy, the OUP margin was flat at 6.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as the improvement in the gross profit margin was offset by expense deleveraging, as we were unable to decrease selling and administrative expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 3.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 3.4% in 2018, due to a decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 33%, 18%, 20%, 12%, and 9%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 10.1% (-5.3% in constant currency and -4.3% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 1.5%, 21.1%, 9.5%, 23.7% and 8.4% (revenue trend of +4.2%, -17.5%, -3.0%, -20.2% and -4.2%, respectively, in constant currency; -0.8% and -16.4% in organic constant 34 currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands , respectively ). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market, decrease s in our staffing/interim services in the Netherlands due to a reduction in manufacturing-related demand and the exit from certain client contracts as a result of pricing decisions, and decreased demand in Sweden related to lower activity from our manufacturing clients . This decrease was also due to a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018 and the 6.9 % decrease (- 1 . 7 % in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. These decreases were partially offset by an increased demand for our Manpower staffing services in the United Kingdom despite talent shortage challenges, improving demand for staffing/interim services in Norway and the favorable impact of approximately one additional billing day . Revenues from services decreased 13.9% (-8.0% in constant currency and -7.2% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 6.9%, 27.0%, 8.2%, 25.8% and 10.5% (-1.2%, -22.3%, -0.1%, -21.0% and -4.9%, respectively, in constant currency; increase of 0.8% and -17.3% in organic constant currency in the Nordics and the Netherlands, respectively). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market, decreases in our staffing/interim services in the Netherlands due to a reduction in manufacturing-related demand and the exit from certain client contracts as a result of pricing decisions, and decreased demand in Sweden related to lower activity from our manufacturing clients. This decrease was also due to a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018 and the 12.2% decrease (-6.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. These decreases were partially offset by an increased demand for our staffing/interim services in Norway. Gross profit margin decreased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes, lower associate utilization and higher vacation and sickness rates in Germany, and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 10.5% (-5.7% in constant currency and -4.3% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 15.7% (-9.9% in constant currency and -9.0% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. The decreases were primarily due to the decreases in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 was also due to a decrease in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities incurred in the third quarter of 2018 and a decrease in restructuring costs to $19.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from $33.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The 2019 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium. OUP margin for Northern Europe for the third quarter of 2019 decreased to 1.8% compared to 3.1% in 2018 due to the decrease in gross profit margin. OUP margin decreased to 1.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from 2.0% in 2018 due to the decrease in the gross profit margin, partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs. APME Revenues from services decreased 12.8% (-12.6% in constant currency and an increase of 4.6% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In Japan (which represents 40% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 12.6% (8.4% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, and a 12.1% increase (8.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day in the quarter. In Australia (which represents 16% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 31.1% (-26.5% in constant currency) as we chose to exit certain low-margin business to improve profitability, and due to the 9.9% decrease (-4.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation in July 2019 and disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, partially offset by increased demand for Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Thailand, and Singapore. 35 Revenues from services decreased 5 . 9 % ( -3 . 1 % in constant currency and an increase of 5. 2 % in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 . In Japan , revenues from services increased 5 . 8 % ( 5 . 3 % in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services , an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, and a 7 . 5 % increase ( 7 . 2 % in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of f ive fewer billing day s in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018 . In Australia , revenues from services decreased 22 . 1 % (- 1 5 . 4 % in constant currency) as we chose to exit certain low-margin business to improve profitability, and due to the 9. 7 % decrease (- 2 . 1 % in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited d econsolidation in July 2019 and disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, partially offset by increased demand for Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Thailand, and Singapore. Gross profit margin decreased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decreases in our permanent recruitment business of 31.8% and 15.6%, respectively (-29.6% and -10.9% in constant currency, respectively), partially offset by the increases in our staffing/interim margins due to the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China in December 2018. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 51.7% (-50.8% in constant currency and -37.5% in organic constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 16.1% (-12.6% in constant currency and -4.9% in organic constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. The decreases were primarily due to the gain from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation in July 2019, less expenses as a result of the ManpowerGroup Greater China deconsolidation in July 2019 and disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China in December 2018, and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs to support the increases in revenues in certain markets. OUP margin for APME was 8.6% in the third quarter of 2019 and 4.5% in 2018. OUP margin was 5.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 4.1% in 2018. The increases were due to the gain from the ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited deconsolidation in July 2019, partially offset by the declines in the gross profit margins. Right Management Revenues from services increased 2.5% (4.7% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to the 7.1% increase (9.7% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced increased demand in our European and Asian markets, partially offset by softer demand in the Americas market and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Our talent management business decreased 11.2% (-9.8% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to softer demand in our European and Asian markets. Revenues from services decreased 3.4% (-0.3% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the 8.3% decrease (-5.4% in constant currency) in our talent management services due mostly to softening demand in our European and Asian markets and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Our outplacement business decreased 1.9% (increase of 1.2% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due mostly to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand in our European and Asian markets. Gross profit margin decreased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in both our outplacement and talent management businesses’ gross profit margins, partially offset by the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a higher percentage of the revenue mix. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 4.5% (-2.6% in constant currency) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the number of offices. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1.1% (increase of 1.9% in constant currency) in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due to a decrease in the number of offices, partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs to $4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from $0.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 36 OUP margin for Right Management in creased to 1 5.5 % in the third quarter of 2019 from 1 4.0 % in 2018 as we were able to increase revenues without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses . OUP margin decreased to 12.9 % in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from 1 5.7 % in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to the increase in restructuring costs and the decline in the gross profit margin. Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of September 30, 2019, we had $681.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $495.4 million and $302.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated $2.7 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $186.7 million utilized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments, and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the original liability recorded at acquisition date for the acquisitions in the Netherlands. The increase was partially offset by the lower net proceeds from the sale of our CICE payroll tax credits, which were $103.5 million (€92.0 million) in April 2019 compared to $234.5 million (€190.9 million) in April 2018. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,122.1 million as of September 30, 2019 from $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018. This decrease is due to changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") increased by approximately 2.0 days from December 31, 2018 due to unfavorable mix changes, with higher growth in countries with a higher average DSO. Capital expenditures were $36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2018 compared to 2019 was primarily due to additional technology investment and the timing of capital expenditures. 38 On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $219.5 million and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $161.2 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The aggregate cash consideration paid reflects a post-closing settlement of net debt and net working capital adjustments of $6.8 million , which w e paid out during the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination, and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $415.1 million , or $97.6 million net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million , which is included within interest and other expenses (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million , $32.5 million represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, was $39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The balance includes consideration payments for franchises in the United States and contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $13.0 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date . For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the total cash consideration for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $50.9 million, the majority of which took place in the Netherlands. This balance includes initial acquisition payments of $8.2 million and contingent consideration payments of $42.7 million, of which $18.6 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date . On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25% of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25%, and then further diluted to 36.87% as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in full on August 7, 2019. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the deconsolidation of the joint venture, we recognized a one-time non-cash gain of $30.4 million, which was included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Included in the $30.4 million was the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $6.2 million related to the joint venture from accumulated other comprehensive income. Cash provided by net debt borrowings was $6.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $170.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of September 30, 2019, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of September 30, 2019. 39 The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses (income) , net , provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0. 76 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5. 16 to 1 as of September 30, 2019 . Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of September 30, 2019, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $313.0 million, of which $257.1 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. In 2018, the Board of Directors made the following dividend declarations: On May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.01 per share which was paid on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018. On November 9, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.01 per share which was paid on December 14, 2018 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2018. To date in 2019, the Board of Directors has made the following dividend declaration: On May 10, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.09 per share which was paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 and July 2016 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first nine months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.8 million shares at a cost of $152.0 million under the 2018 authorization. During the first nine months of 2018, we repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares comprised of 2.8 million shares under the 2016 authorization and 0.3 million shares under the 2018 authorization, at a total cost of $299.2 million. As of September 30, 2019, there were 6.0 million and 1.3 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2019 authorization and 2018 authorization, respectively, and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2016 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,058.6 million as of September 30, 2019 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,236.4 million as of December 31, 2018. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling approximately $205.7 million and $190.3 million as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively ($154.1 million and $139.0 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.6 million and $51.3 million for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The letters of credit relate to workers’ compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded net restructuring costs of $42.5 million and $39.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve was $42.5 million ($4.6 million of this amount was transferred to current operating lease liabilities). We expect a majority of the remaining $15.5 million reserve will be paid, utilized or transferred out by the end of 2019. Application of Critical Accounting Policies In accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. 40 Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2019 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units’ carrying amount over its fair value. We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2019 and determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The table below provides a sample of our reporting units estimated fair values and carrying values, which were determined as part of our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. The reporting units included below represent approximately 80% of our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2019. (in millions) France United States United Kingdom Right Management Germany Canada Netherlands Estimated fair values $ 2,723.2 $ 1,386.4 $ 407.6 $ 308.9 $ 265.8 $ 184.2 $ 158.7 Carrying values 1,302.9 801.5 337.2 126.6 262.8 92.0 129.1 The fair value of each reporting unit was at least 20 percent in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value with the exception of the Germany reporting unit. During the second quarter of 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of the interim test, we wrote the fair value of the Germany reporting unit down to its carrying value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge loss of $60.2 million during the second quarter of 2019. Key assumptions included in the Germany discounted cash flow valuation performed during the third quarter of 2019 included a discount rate of 10.8% and a terminal value revenue growth rate of 2.0%. Should the operations of the business incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, some or all of the recorded goodwill, which was $64.8 million as of September 30, 2019, could be subject to impairment. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.8 million related to our New Zealand operations as a result of not meeting profitability expectations.

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collaterization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payroll Tax Credit In April 2019, we sold a portion of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $ 103.5 (€ 92.0 ). In April 2018, we sold substantially all of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2017 for net proceeds of $ 234.5 (€ 190.9 ). We derecognized these receivables and the additional interest upon the sale date as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment in accordance with the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits. Goodwill Impairment In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level and indefinite-lived assets at our unit of account level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying value. The most recent annual impairment test was performed during the third quarter of 2018. For the second quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was below its carrying amount. We identified several factors related to our Germany reporting unit that led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying amount. These factors included a further downward trend in the performance of the business due to current market conditions, a more cautious outlook for the business stemming from the impact 8 of changes to temporary staffing regulation s in Germany , and the recording of a valuation allowance against our Germany deferred tax assets during the second quarter. As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Germany reporting unit was below its carrying amount, we performed an interim impairment test on this reporting unit as of June 30, 2019. As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 60.2 . The Germany reporting unit is included in the Northern Europe segment. In performing our interim impairment test, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing an income approach derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. The income approach is developed from management’s forecasted cash flow data. Significant assumptions used in our interim goodwill impairment test included: expected revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rate, and a terminal value multiple. In addition, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.8 related to our New Zealand operations as a result of not meeting profitability expectations. Subsequent Events On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. Prior to the initial public offering, we owned a 51 % controlling interest in the joint venture and consolidated the financial position and results of its operations into our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our APME segment. As a result of the offering, in which ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited issued new shares representing 25 % of the equity of the company, our ownership interest was diluted to 38.25 %, subject to further dilution to 36.87 % if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full. As a result, we will deconsolidate the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting and record our share of equity income or loss in interest and other (income) expenses, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We will finalize our accounting for this transaction during the third quarter of 2019. We have evaluated all other events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date through our filing date and have accrued or disclosed any related accounting impacts, if appropriate. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2019 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued new accounting guidance on leases, ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which we adopted on January 1, 2019. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depend on the classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption. As of the transition date, the ROU asset and total lease liability (current and long-term) were $ 458.1 and $ 458.7 , respectively. We elected the package of three practical expedients which lessened the transitional burden of implementing the new guidance. Accordingly, we did not reassess: 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; or 3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. Lastly, we have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on hedge accounting. The amendments in this guidance include the elimination of the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges, recognition and presentation of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, recognition and presentation of components excluded from an entity's hedge effectiveness assessment, addition of the ability to elect to perform subsequent effectiveness assessments qualitatively, and addition of new disclosure requirements. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. There was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the modified disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting comprehensive income. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the United States Tax 9 Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""Tax Act""). The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2019. We elected not to adopt this optional reclassification. In June 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment awards. The guidance makes the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees la rgely consistent with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. T here was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on financial instruments. The new guidance requires application of an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to certain financial instruments. Using the CECL model, an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable loss has been incurred. The new guidance is effective for us in 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance is effective for us in 2021. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to June 30, 2019, related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $ 42.5 at June 30, 2019 and $ 42.8 at December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to $ 35.6 of revenues recognized related to amounts that were included in the December 31, 2018 balance, partially offset by payments or amounts due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations in the six months ended June 30, 2019. 10 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $ 5.3 and $ 4.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (5) Acquisitions On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51 % controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20 % interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $ 212.7 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $ 58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $ 154.4 was for cash and cash equivalents. The amounts paid are subject to certain working capital and net debt adjustments based on the actual working capital and net debt existing on the acquisition date compared to target amounts. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the June 30, 2019 Consolidated Balance 12 Sheets, and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $ 408.3 , or $ 90.8 net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $ 80.4 , which is included within interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4, $ 32.5 represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. The assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 within our Southern Europe segment. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities include the following: April 3, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 317.5 Accounts receivable 60.4 Prepaid expenses and other assets 31.4 Goodwill 31.2 Intangible assets subject to amortization, customer relationship 19.6 Intangible assets not subject to amortization, reacquired franchise rights 25.5 Property and equipment 0.4 Accounts payable 21.6 Employee compensation payable 2.5 Accrued liabilities 13.7 Accrued payroll taxes and insurance 7.5 Value added taxes payable 7.4 Other long-term liabilities 25.0 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 408.3 The amounts in the above table represent the preliminary allocation of purchase price and are subject to revision when valuations are finalized for intangible assets, which are expected in 2019. The customer relationship intangible asset is expected to be amortized over a 15 year useful life. The goodwill from the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Manpower Switzerland contributed net revenues from services of $ 111.0 since the acquisition. Our consolidated unaudited proforma historical net revenues from services, as if Manpower Switzerland had been acquired at the beginning of 2018, are estimated as follows: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net revenues from services $ 5,373.1 $ 5,780.9 $ 10,516.6 $ 11,397.7 From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG, net of cash acquired, was $ 17.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This balance represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $ 13.0 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the total cash consideration for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $ 47.4 , the majority of which took place in the Netherlands. This balance includes initial acquisition payments of $ 8.2 and contingent consideration payments of $ 39.2 , of which $ 15.1 had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 41.4 and $ 39.3 during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve was $ 31.9 . We expect a majority of the remaining $ 25.0 reserve will be paid, utilized or transferred out by the end of 2019. 13 Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 0.3 $ 1.7 $ 13.1 $ — $ 0.4 $ — $ 15.5 Severance costs 3.8 5.3 16.5 3.5 0.2 2.3 31.6 Office closure costs and other 1.3 0.1 2.2 0.9 4.5 0.8 9.8 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out (3) ( 4.2 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 16.5 ) ( 2.2 ) ( 5.0 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 31.9 ) Balance, June 30, 2019 $ 1.2 $ 4.0 $ 15.3 $ 2.2 $ 0.1 $ 2.2 $ 25.0 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 0.3 and $ 0.9 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $ 0.9 as of both December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019. Balances related to Italy were $ 0.5 and $ 1.0 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, respectively. (3) Restructuring reserve of $ 7.1 was transferred to current operating lease liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2019. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 36.7 % for three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 27.5 % for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, the goodwill impairment related to our investments in Germany and New Zealand, which was nondeductible, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of the gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland, which was non-taxable. The 36.7 % effective tax rate in the quarter was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, restructuring costs recorded in the quarter, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. We recorded income tax expense at the effective rate of 38.6 % for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 28.3 % for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The 38.6 % effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 % primarily due to the French business tax, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. As of June 30, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $ 35.2 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties of $ 34.2 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2012 through 2019 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of June 30, 2019, we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share – basic and net earnings per share – diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 127.3 $ 143.4 $ 180.8 $ 240.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 60.0 65.7 60.3 65.8 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 Effect of other share-based awards 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 60.4 66.1 60.7 66.4 Net earnings per share - basic $ 2.12 $ 2.18 $ 3.00 $ 3.65 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 2.11 $ 2.17 $ 2.98 $ 3.62 14 There were 0.4 million and 0.3 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share – diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the calculations of earnings per share – diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,262.4 $ — $ 1,262.4 $ 1,297.1 $ — $ 1,297.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 464.2 $ 365.5 $ 98.7 $ 444.8 $ 351.7 $ 93.1 Other 18.4 17.1 1.3 18.5 16.0 2.5 482.6 382.6 100.0 463.3 367.7 95.6 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 124.3 — 124.3 98.7 — 98.7 176.3 — 176.3 150.7 — 150.7 Total intangible assets $ 658.9 $ 382.6 $ 276.3 $ 614.0 $ 367.7 $ 246.3 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 577.4 and $ 513.4 as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $ 139.5 as of both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2019 is expected to be $ 15.1 and in each of the next five years as follows: 2020- $ 25.4 , 2021- $ 14.7 , 2022- $ 11.1 , 2023- $ 9.0 , 2024- $ 7.7 . Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe (3) APME (3) Right Management Corporate (4) Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 519.9 $ 112.2 $ 435.4 $ 102.0 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,297.1 Goodwill acquired 0.4 31.2 - - - - 31.6 Currency and other impacts 1.7 ( 0.6 ) ( 4.1 ) 0.7 - - ( 2.3 ) Impairment charge - - ( 60.2 ) ( 3.8 ) - - ( 64.0 ) Balance, June 30, 2019 $ 522.0 $ 142.8 $ 371.1 $ 98.9 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,262.4 (1) Balances related to the United States were $ 476.5 as of both December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019. (2) Balances related to France were $ 68.9 and $ 68.3 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Balances related to Italy were $ 4.8 and $ 4.7 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, respectively. (3) The impairment charges of $ 60.2 and $ 3.8 relate to our Germany and New Zealand reporting units, respectively, which were recorded during the second quarter of 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. ( 4 ) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisition of Jefferson Wells ($ 55.5 ) which is now part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. 15 Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2019 2018 United States $ 532.0 $ 532.0 Netherlands 111.1 112.0 United Kingdom 93.2 93.7 France 68.3 68.9 Germany 67.5 129.2 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Other reporting units 328.2 299.2 Total goodwill $ 1,262.4 $ 1,297.1 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our plans were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost $ 4.3 $ 2.8 $ 6.8 $ 5.6 Interest cost 3.2 2.9 6.3 5.9 Expected return on assets ( 3.6 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 5.9 ) ( 5.5 ) Other 0.4 0.3 0.9 0.7 Total benefit cost $ 4.3 $ 3.3 $ 8.1 $ 6.7 Retiree Health Care Plan 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Interest cost $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.3 $ 0.2 Prior service credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 0.4 ) Total benefit credit $ - $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.1 ) $ ( 0.2 ) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, contributions made to our pension plans were $ 2.9 and $ 4.4 , respectively, and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $ 0.3 and $ 0.6 , respectively. During 2019, we expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 13.0 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: June 30, December 31, 2019 2018 Foreign currency translation $ ( 285.9 ) $ ( 223.2 ) Reclassification of currency translation adjustment to income related to disposition of partially held equity interest (see Note 5) 32.5 - Translation gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of income taxes of $( 10.9 ) and $( 12.9 ), respectively 1.6 ( 4.7 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans ( 130.4 ) ( 137.2 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $( 23.0 ) and $( 23.2 ), respectively ( 37.2 ) ( 37.9 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $ 1.9 and $ 2.0 for 2019 and 2018, respectively 2.9 3.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 416.5 ) $ ( 399.8 ) 16 Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, reported in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other (income) expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $ 0.1 and $ 1.0 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 1.1 and $ 2.2 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The portion of earnings attributed to the noncontrolling interest for ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited is included in the above amounts. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the subsequent deconsolidation of the entity.) Dividends On May 10, 2019 and May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $ 1.09 and $ 1.01 per share, respectively. The 2019 dividends were paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019 . The 2018 dividends were paid on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018 . Share Repurchases In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 and July 2016 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $ 101.0 under the 2018 authorization. During the first six months of 2018, we repurchased 1.0 million shares at a cost of $ 113.2 under the 2016 authorization. As of June 30, 2019, there were 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2016 authorization. (12) Interest and Other (Income) Expenses, Net Interest and other (income) expenses, net consisted of the following: 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 11.2 $ 13.3 $ 21.4 $ 26.9 Interest income ( 1.1 ) ( 1.4 ) ( 2.6 ) ( 2.6 ) Foreign exchange (gain) loss ( 0.5 ) ( 0.1 ) 2.4 ( 0.2 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net (1) ( 79.8 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 79.5 ) 2.5 Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ ( 70.2 ) $ 10.5 $ ( 58.3 ) $ 26.6 (1) Includes an $ 80.4 gain related to our acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed using derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) and cross-currency swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. 17 The € 400.0 ($ 453.3 ) notes due September 2022 and the € 500.0 ($ 563.4 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of June 30, 2019. The gain or loss associated with foreign currency translation on these notes is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (""AOCI""), net of taxes. On occasion, forward contracts are also designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. In April 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert our intercompany fixed-rate, Swiss franc (“CHF”) denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swap agreement was to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the notes by fixing the principal at € 202.3 with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.256 %. This hedging arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures in April 2022, which matches the term of the intercompany note. Gains and losses from the hedge offsets the changes in the value of principal and interest payments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreement. The change in the fair value of the swap is deferred in AOCI in the Consolidated Statement of Operations until the hedged item impacts earnings. The effect of our net investment hedges and cross-currency swaps on AOCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, and 2018 was as follows: Gain (Loss) Recognized in Location of Gain Reclassified Gain Reclassified Instrument Other Comprehensive Income from AOCI into Income from AOCI into Income 3 Months Ended June 30, 3 Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 (1) 2019 2018 (1) Euro Notes $ ( 13.9 ) $ 47.1 Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ - $ - Cross-currency swaps 5.0 - Interest and other (income) expenses, net 5.4 - Gain Recognized in Location of Gain Reclassified Gain Reclassified Instrument Other Comprehensive Income from AOCI into Income from AOCI into Income 6 Months Ended June 30, 6 Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 (1) 2019 2018 (1) Euro Notes $ 8.5 $ 25.9 Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ - $ - Cross-currency swaps 5.0 - Interest and other (income) expenses, net 5.4 - (1) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains and losses included in AOCI at June 30, 2019 to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in the current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. The effect of our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30 was as follows: Location of Gain Amount of Gain Recognized in Income Instrument Recognized in Income 3 Months Ended June 30, 6 Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Foreign currency forward contracts Interest and other (income) expenses, net $ 9.1 $ 2.1 $ 9.2 $ 2.1 18 The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018: Assets June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as hedges: Cross-currency swaps Prepaid expenses and other assets $ 5.1 $ - Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net 9.2 0.1 Total instruments $ 14.3 $ 0.1 Liabilities June 30, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt 1,083.5 1,032.0 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities — 0.1 Total instruments $ 1,083.5 $ 1,032.1 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $ 1,083.5 and $ 1,052.9 as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to a carrying value of $ 1,016.7 and $ 1,024.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $ 101.6 and $ 89.5 as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). (14) Leases We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 12 years. Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. We have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. That is, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. 19 The components of lease expense were as follows: 3 Months Ended 6 Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2019 Operating lease expense $ 35.0 $ 69.7 Short-term lease expense 6.0 12.1 Other lease expense (1) $ 4.8 $ 9.9 Total lease expense $ 45.8 $ 91.7 (1) Other lease expense includes immaterial variable lease expense and sublease income. Other information related to leases was as follows: 6 Months Ended June 30, Supplemental Cash Flows Information 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 64.8 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 69.7 June 30, Supplemental balance sheet information 2019 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 458.5 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 126.6 Operating lease liabilities - long-term 334.3 Total operating lease liabilities $ 460.9 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; APME; and Right Management. The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services and other services. The Right Management segment revenues are derived from outplacement and talent management services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 3 Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 630.9 $ 640.5 $ 1,234.5 $ 1,256.8 Other Americas 412.5 412.0 816.2 818.3 1,043.4 1,052.5 2,050.7 2,075.1 Southern Europe: France 1,420.2 1,512.5 2,721.6 2,936.5 Italy 394.0 443.0 749.9 856.6 Other Southern Europe 573.0 478.5 1,017.9 952.9 2,387.2 2,434.0 4,489.4 4,746.0 Northern Europe 1,183.2 1,393.2 2,372.9 2,810.8 APME 708.9 724.8 1,408.8 1,445.0 Right Management 50.4 52.4 96.2 102.4 Consolidated (b) $ 5,373.1 $ 5,656.9 $ 10,418.0 $ 11,179.3 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 32.2 $ 38.2 $ 48.6 $ 64.9 Other Americas 17.3 18.5 32.1 34.7 49.5 56.7 80.7 99.6 Southern Europe: France 75.7 73.0 131.2 130.7 Italy 29.8 31.9 50.2 57.1 Other Southern Europe 18.0 16.8 29.0 31.6 123.5 121.7 210.4 219.4 Northern Europe 24.3 24.7 24.9 41.3 APME 28.1 29.2 48.2 55.1 Right Management 9.0 10.5 11.1 16.9 234.4 242.8 375.3 432.3 Corporate expenses ( 31.9 ) ( 25.9 ) ( 59.8 ) ( 52.7 ) Goodwill impairment charge ( 64.0 ) - ( 64.0 ) - Intangible asset amortization expense ( 7.7 ) ( 8.6 ) ( 15.2 ) ( 17.5 ) Operating profit 130.8 208.3 236.3 362.1 Interest and other (income) expenses, net 70.2 ( 10.5 ) 58.3 ( 26.6 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 201.0 $ 197.8 $ 294.6 $ 335.5 21 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $ 3.7 and $ 3.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $ 7.3 and $ 7.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 154.3 and $ 166.7 for the three months ended three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 311.2 and $ 315.7 six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $ 4.1 and $ 6.2 for the three months ended three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 9.7 and $ 11.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $ 163.2 and $ 273.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 406.2 and $ 510.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. (16) Contingencies Litigation On April 26, 2017, the sellers of 7S, a company we acquired in 2015, formally disputed the contingent consideration related to the acquisition, claiming that they were owed an additional $ 23.7 (€ 20.8 ), plus interest. The dispute was submitted to an arbitration tribunal in Germany. On June 28, 2019, the arbitration forum handed down its decision, rejecting the claims brought by the 7S sellers. Finding in favor of ManpowerGroup, the arbitration tribunal confirmed that no further amounts are owed by us, and also awarded us reimbursement of legal fees and other costs. 22 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on pages 33 and 34 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Business Overview Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. By contrast, during periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in both the second quarter of 2019 and first half of 2019, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. We continued to see significant variation across global labor markets during the second quarter, which is reflected in our results and evidenced by our most recent surveys, which show hiring intentions strengthening in about half of the countries we surveyed, and weakening in about half of the countries, with considerable uncertainty and unpredictability in our European markets being impacted by concerns over trade wars and Brexit. During the second quarter of 2019, the United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets than in the second quarter of 2018, having an unfavorable impact on our reported results. This strengthening was particularly pronounced against the Euro and British Pound. Our reported revenues from services decreased 5.0% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and our reported operating profit decreased 37.2%. These results were partly impacted by the relative weakness of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to the same period in 2018, and generally may understate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 4.9% unfavorable impact on revenues from services, a 4.0% unfavorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.08 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, our businesses did not experience significant changes in revenue trends from the previous quarter. The environment continued to be one of revenue declines in most of our markets, with sluggish trends in Europe overshadowing modest constant currency growth elsewhere. Our consolidated revenues were down 0.1% in constant currency in the quarter, an improvement from the 2.2% constant currency decline in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to the additional revenues from the acquisition in April 2019 of the remaining controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”). After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency revenue decrease was 0.6% compared to a 1.1% decrease in the first quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, several key markets within Southern and Northern Europe continued to experience revenue declines, partially offset by continued constant currency revenue increases in certain markets within the Americas and APME. We experienced a revenue decline in organic constant currency in Southern Europe due to the revenue decline in Italy, partially offset by organic constant currency revenue growth in certain markets within Other Southern Europe, while constant currency revenue in France was flat. The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the decrease in Germany resulting from the continued challenges posed by new regulations as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. In the Americas, revenues increased 2.5% in constant currency due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within Other Americas and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. These increases were partially offset by decrease in the United States primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. In APME, revenues increased 1.3% in constant currency primarily due to an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues. As of the date of this report, we expect that the trend we saw during the first two quarters of the year will continue into the second half of the year, with European labor markets and our European results being sluggish, and improving organic constant currency results in the Americas and APME. Our gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 decreased due to a declining demand for services within our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions Talent-Based Outsourcing business. Our staffing/interim margin was flat year-over-year as improvement from pricing initiatives in a few of our largest markets and a favorable direct cost adjustment in France was offset by declines in most of our markets within Northern Europe. 23 We recorded $ 64.0 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our investments in Germany and New Zealand ($60.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively) and additional charges of $1.6 million related to our New Zealand operations i n the second quarter of 2019 . Our operating profit decreased 37.2% in the second quarter of 2019 by (-33.2% in constant currency) while our operating profit margin was down 130 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the goodwill impairment and related charges incurred in the second quarter of 2019 and $15.3 million of restructuring costs incurred in the second quarter of 2018, our operating profit was down 7.5% in constant currency while operating profit margin was down 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018. We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities. We have made steps to reposition our portfolio of businesses. In addition to our Manpower Switzerland acquisition in April 2019 (see further information in Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements), ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited completed its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Market in July 2019, with finalization of the accounting treatment occurring in the third quarter of 2019 (see further information in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited’s results were included in our consolidated results for all of the second quarter and first half of 2019. Operating Results - Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 2018. (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 5,373.1 $ 5,656.9 (5.0 )% (0.1 )% Cost of services 4,502.7 4,734.2 (4.9 )% — Gross profit 870.4 922.7 (5.7 )% (1.1 )% Gross profit margin 16.2 % 16.3 % (0.7 )% Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charge 675.6 714.4 (5.4 )% (1.0 )% Goodwill impairment charge 64.0 - — — Selling and administrative expenses 739.6 714.4 3.6 % 8.3 % Operating profit 130.8 208.3 (37.2 )% (33.2 )% Operating profit margin 2.4 % 3.7 % Interest and other (income) expenses, net (70.2 ) 10.5 Earnings before income taxes 201.0 197.8 1.6 % 5.6 % Provision for income taxes 73.7 54.4 35.6 % Effective income tax rate 36.7 % 27.5 % Net earnings $ 127.3 $ 143.4 (11.3 )% (8.0 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 2.11 $ 2.16 (2.3 )% 0.9 % Weighted average shares – diluted 60.4 66.1 (8.8 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 5.0% (-0.1% in constant currency and -1.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • decreased demand for services in several of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 15.1% (-9.6% in constant currency and -8.9% in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services. We experienced revenue declines in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Nordics of 30.0%, 25.8%, 11.0%, 8.1%, and 9.0% (-25.7%, -21.2%, -5.6%, -2.8%, and -1.7%, respectively, in constant currency; -17.4% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands); • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 1.9% (increase of 3.7% in constant currency; -0.9% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 6.1% (flat in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 5.6% (increase of 0.2% in constant currency), partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. The 24 Southern Europe decrease also included a decrease in Italy of 11.1% ( -5.7% in constant currency) due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment, partially offset by a 4.9 % increase ( 11.1 % in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business; • a 1.5% revenue decrease in the United States primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day; • a revenue decrease in APME of 2.2% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency and 5.0% in organic constant currency) due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues; • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 3.9% (-0.9% in constant currency), including a 4.7% decrease (-1.7% in constant currency) in our outplacement services, as well as a 1.7% decrease (increase of 1.3% in constant currency) in our talent management business; and • a 4.9% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • our acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe in April 2019 partially offset by our dispositions of smaller businesses in Northern Europe and APME at the end of December 2018, which on a net basis added approximately 1.4% revenue growth to our consolidated results on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year 10 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a declining demand for services within our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions Talent Based Outsourcing business. Our staffing/interim margin was flat year-over-year as improvement from pricing initiatives in a few of our largest markets and favorable direct cost adjustment in France was offset by declines in most of our markets within Northern Europe. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 (8.3% in constant currency and 7.1% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • goodwill impairment and related charges of $65.6 million related to our Germany reporting unit and New Zealand operations incurred in the second quarter of 2019; and • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $12.1 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe; partially offset by • a 9.9% decrease (-6.3% in constant currency) in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities incurred in the second quarter of 2018; • a $3.4 million decrease in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of dispositions in December 2018 in Northern Europe and APME; • a 4.7% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and • a decrease in restructuring costs with zero incurred in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $15.3 million incurred in the second quarter of 2018. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 120 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to the 120 basis point unfavorable impact from the goodwill impairment and other related charges, 10 basis point unfavorable impact due to expense deleveraging as we were unable to decrease expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment and other related charges and restructuring costs, at the same rate as our revenue decline on an organic constant currency basis, and the 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. These items were partially offset by a 20 basis point favorable impact from the decrease in restructuring costs. Interest and other (income) expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other (income) expenses, net was income of $70.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to expense of $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2018. Net interest expense decreased $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2019 to $10.1 million from $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2018 due to the lower interest rate on our €500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Miscellaneous income was $79.8 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in miscellaneous income was primarily due to the gain of 25 $80.4 million from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland partially offset by the decrease in the income from the equity investment in Switzerland prior to the acquisition . We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 36.7% for three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 27.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, the goodwill impairment related to our investments in Germany and New Zealand, which was nondeductible, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of the gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland, which was non-taxable. The 36.7% effective tax rate in the quarter was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, restructuring costs recorded in the quarter, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany. Net earnings per share - diluted was $2.11 and $2.17 in the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The gain from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland recorded in the second quarter of 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.32 per share. Goodwill impairment and related tax and other charges negatively impacted net earnings per share – diluted by approximately $1.26. Restructuring costs recorded in the second quarter of 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.18 per share, net of tax, in the second quarter of 2018. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 60.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 from 66.1 million in the second quarter of 2018. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the second quarter of 2018. 26 Operating Results - Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 2018. (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 10,418.0 $ 11,179.3 (6.8 )% (1.1 )% Cost of services 8,742.8 9,371.2 (6.7 )% (1.0 )% Gross profit 1,675.2 1,808.1 (7.3 )% (2.0 )% Gross profit margin 16.1 % 16.2 % Selling and administrative expenses, excluding goodwill impairment charge 1,374.9 1,446.0 (4.9 )% 0.4 % Goodwill impairment charge 64.0 - - - Selling and administrative expenses 1,438.9 1,446.0 (0.5 )% 5.0 % Operating profit 236.3 362.1 (34.8 )% (30.2 )% Operating profit margin 2.3 % 3.2 % Interest and other (income) expenses, net (58.3 ) 26.6 - Earnings before income taxes 294.6 335.5 (12.2 )% (7.6 )% Provision for income taxes 113.8 95.1 19.8 % Effective income tax rate 38.6 % 28.3 % Net earnings $ 180.8 $ 240.4 (24.8 )% (21.1 )% Net earnings per share – diluted $ 2.98 $ 3.62 (17.7 )% (13.5 )% Weighted average shares – diluted 60.7 66.4 (8.5 )% The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 6.8% (-1.1% in constant currency and -1.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • decreased demand for services in several of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 15.6% (9.2% in constant currency and 8.6% in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services. We experienced revenue declines in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Nordics of 29.5%, 26.7%, 11.5%, 9.5%, and 7.6% (-24.5%, -21.4%, -5.2%, -3.7%, and an increase of 1.1%, respectively, in constant currency; -17.7% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands); • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 5.4% (increase of 1.1% in constant currency; -1.2% in organic constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 7.3% (-0.7% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. The Southern Europe decrease also included a decrease in Italy of 12.5% (-6.3% in constant currency) due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment, partially offset by a 6.1% increase (13.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business; • a revenue decrease in the United States of 1.8% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day; • a revenue decrease in APME of 2.5% (increase of 1.6% in constant currency) due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues; • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 6.1% (-2.7% in constant currency), including a 6.0% decrease (-2.6% in constant currency) in our outplacement services, as well as a 6.8% decrease (-3.1% in constant currency) in our talent management business; and • a 5.7% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • our acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe in April 2019 partially offset by our dispositions of smaller businesses in Northern Europe and APME at the end of December 2018, which on a net basis added approximately 0.4% revenue growth to our consolidated results on a constant currency basis. 27 The year-over-year 10 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: • a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from declining demand for our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions services, particularly within our Talent Based Outsourcing business; partially offset by • a 10 basis point favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rate. The 0.5% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 (increase of 5.0% in constant currency and 4.6% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 6.8% decrease (-1.6% in constant currency; -1.9% in organic constant currency) in office-related costs primarily due to a decrease in the number of offices as a result of our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations; • a $6.2 million decrease in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of dispositions in December 2018 in Northern Europe and APME; and • a 4.5% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • goodwill impairment and related charges of $65.6 million related to our Germany reporting unit and New Zealand operations in the six months ended June 30, 2019; • the additional recurring selling and administrative costs of $12.1 million incurred as a result of the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland in Southern Europe; and • restructuring costs of $39.8 million incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $39.3 million incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 90 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018 due to a 60 basis point unfavorable impact from the goodwill impairment and other related charges, 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs, and a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The remaining 10 basis point unfavorable impact is due to expense deleveraging as we were unable to decrease expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment and other related charges and restructuring costs, at the same rate as our revenue decline on an organic constant currency basis. Interest and other (income) expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other (income) expenses, net was income of $58.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to expenses of $26.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Net interest expense decreased $5.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to $18.8 million from $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 due to the lower interest rate on our €500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Miscellaneous income was $79.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to miscellaneous expense of $2.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The change was primarily due to the gain of $80.4 million from the acquisition of Manpower Switzerland and a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the decrease in the income from the equity investment in Switzerland prior to the acquisition. We recorded income tax expense at the effective rate of 38.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to an effective rate of 28.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The 38.6% effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, our overall mix of earnings, and the recognition of a valuation allowance in Germany Net earnings per share - diluted was $2.98 and $3.62 in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.15 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Restructuring costs recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.52 and $0.45 per share, net of tax, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 28 Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 60.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 66.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 . This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the six months ended June 30, 2018 , partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the six months ended June 30, 2018 . Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 0.9% (increase of 2.5% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 1.5% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, and a 1.3% decrease in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services increased 0.1% (8.8% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, and Peru of 3.1%, 6.0%, and 13.0%, respectively (1.7%, 9.9%, and 15.1%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil of 35.8%, 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively (increases of 21.2%, 11.3% and 7.2%, respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.2% (increase of 2.8% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. In the United States, revenues from services decreased 1.8% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in our permanent recruitment business and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 0.3% (increase of 9.7% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, and Peru of 3.8%, 6.8%, and 11.8%, respectively (4.3%, 11.5%, and 14.3%, respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil of 38.9%, 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively (increases of 18.1%, 11.3% and 11.1%, respectively, in constant currency). Gross profit margin decreased in both the second quarter and the first half of 2019 compared to 2018 due to business mix changes within our s taffing/interim business, as a larger percentage of our revenues came from our lower-margin entities within Other Americas. These decreases were partially offset by an improved staffing/interim margins in the United States, due to pricing discipline and lower payroll tax and insurance costs. The gross profit margin also decreased for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease of 2.0% (-0.4% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. The gross profit margin decrease in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018 was also partially offset by an increase of 0.4% (2.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In the second quarter and first half of 2019, selling and administrative expenses increased 1.9% (4.8% in constant currency) and 3.6% (7.2% in constant currency), respectively, due primarily to an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount related to growth initiatives. The increase in the first half of 2019 was also due to the increase in restructuring costs to $5.1 million from $0.3 million in the first half of 2018. 29 Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 4.7 % and 5 . 4 % for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 5.1 % in the second quarter of 2019 from 6.0 % in 2018 . The margin decrease in 2019 in the United States was primarily due to increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives incurred in the second quarter of 2019 and increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 4.2 % in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 4. 5 % in 2018 due to increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. OUP margin in the Americas was 3.9% and 4.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 3.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 5.2% in 2018. The margin decrease in 2019 in the United States was primarily due to increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives incurred in the second quarter of 2019 and increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 4.2% in 2018 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs and increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased 1.9% (increase of 3.7% in constant currency; -0.9% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, revenues from services decreased 6.1% (flat in constant currency) in France (which represents 59% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 11.1% (-5.7% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 17% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 5.6% (increase of 0.2% in constant currency), partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. The decrease in Italy was due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 4.9% increase (11.1% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 19.7% (25.2% in constant currency and 1.8% in organic constant currency) during the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, due to the additional revenue from our acquisition in April 2019 of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland, which represents approximately 5% of Southern Europe’s revenues, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and an increase in our permanent recruitment business of 13.3% (19.3% in constant currency and 7.7% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Revenues from services decreased 5.4% (increase of 1.1% in constant currency -1.2% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. In the six months ended June 30, 2019, revenues from services decreased 7.3% (-0.7% in constant currency) in France and decreased 12.5% (-6.3% in constant currency) in Italy. The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, and a decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 3.9% (increase of 3.0% in constant currency), partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. The decrease in Italy was due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 6.1% increase (13.6% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services increased 6.8% (13.4% in constant currency and 1.6% in organic constant currency) during the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018, due to the additional revenue from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland, an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and the increase in our permanent recruitment business of 1.7% (8.9% in constant currency and 6.2% in organic constant currency), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased in both the second quarter and first half of 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the increases in France's staffing/interim margin as a result of favorable pricing actions, favorable direct cost adjustments and various initiatives to offset the unfavorable impact from transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program. The Southern Europe gross profit margins also increased due to growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 4.0% and 1.7%, respectively (9.9% and 8.9% in constant currency and 5.8% and 6.9% in organic constant currency, respectively) in the permanent recruitment business for the second quarter and first half of 2019 comparted to 2018. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.1% (5.8% in constant currency and 0.3% in organic constant currency) during the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the additional recurring costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in restructuring costs to zero in the second quarter of 2019 from $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Selling and 30 administrative expenses decreased 2.9% (increase of 3.9% in constant currency and 1.2% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018, due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rate s , partially offset by the additional recurring costs from our acquisition of the remaining interest in Manpower Switzerland and an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 5.2% for second quarter of 2019 compared to 5.0% for 2018. In France, the OUP margin increased to 5.3% for the second quarter of 2019 from 4.8% in 2018, primarily due to the improvement in the gross profit margin. In Italy, the OUP margin increased to 7.6% for the second quarter of 2019 from 7.2% for 2018, primarily due to improvement in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 3.1% for the second quarter of 2019 from 3.5% in 2018, due to a decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 4.6% for 2018. In France, the OUP margin increased to 4.8% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 4.5% in 2018, primarily due to the improvement in the gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in salary-related expenses. In Italy, the OUP margin was flat at 6.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, as the improvement in the gross profit margin was offset by an increase in restructuring costs. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 2.8% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 3.3% in 2018, due to a decline in the gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 33%, 17%, 22%, 12%, and 8%, respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 15.1% (-9.6% in constant currency and -8.9% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 8.1%, 30.0%, 9.0%, 25.8% and 11.0% (-2.8%, -25.7%, -1.7%, -21.2% and -5.6%, respectively, in constant currency; -17.4% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market, reduced demand in the Netherlands, and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. This decrease was also due to a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018 and the 14.4% decrease (-8.8% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. These decreases were partially offset an increased demand for our staffing/interim services in Norway. Revenues from services decreased 15.6% (9.2% in constant currency and 8.6% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 9.5%, 29.5%, 7.6%, 26.7% and 11.5% (-3.7%, -24.5%, increase of 1.1%, -21.4% and -5.2%, respectively, in constant currency; -17.7% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market, decrease in the UK due to reduced production from one of our automotive clients, reduced demand in the Netherlands, and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. This decrease was also due to a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018 and the 14.4% decrease (-7.9% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. These decreases were partially offset an increased demand for our staffing/interim services in Norway as well as a constant currency increase in our Experis interim business primarily within the IT sector in the United Kingdom. Gross profit margin decreased in both the second quarter and first half of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes, lower associate utilization and higher vacation and sickness rates in Germany, and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 21.8% (-16.7% in constant currency and -15.9% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 17.9% (-11.6% in constant currency and -10.9% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. The decreases were primarily due to the decreases in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices, and a decrease in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities incurred in the second quarter of 2018. The decreases are also due to the decreases of restructuring costs to zero and $18.7 million, respectively, in the second quarter and first half of 2019 from $13.2 31 million and $33.3 million, respectively, in the second quarter and first half of 2018. The 2019 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium. OUP margin for Northern Europe for the second quarter of 2019 increased to 2.0% compared to 1.8% in 2018 due to the decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit margin. OUP margin decreased to 1.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 1.5% in 2018 due to the decrease in the gross profit margin, partially offset for the decrease in restructuring costs APME Revenues from services decreased 2.2% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency and 5.0% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In Japan (which represents 33% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 4.2% (4.9% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, and a 0.5% increase (1.5%% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of three fewer billing days in the quarter. In Australia (which represents 16% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 21.9% (-15.6% in constant currency) as we chose to exit certain low-margin business to improve profitability, and due to the 5.5% decrease (increase of 2.1% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, and Singapore, increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, partially offset by the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018. ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited completed its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Market in July 2019, with finalization of the accounting treatment occurring in the third quarter of 2019 (see further information in Note 1). ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited’s results were included in our consolidated results for all of the second quarter and first half of 2019. Revenues from services decreased 2.5% (increase of 1.6% in constant currency and 5.5% in organic constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. In Japan, revenues from services increased 2.5% (3.8% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services, increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, and a 5.3% increase (6.8% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of four fewer billing days in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018. In Australia, revenues from services decreased 17.6% (-10.0% in constant currency) as we chose to exit certain low-margin business to improve profitability, and due to the 9.6% decrease (-1.2% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The revenue increase in the remaining markets in APME is due to increased demand for Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, and Singapore, and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, partially offset by the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018. Gross profit margin increased in both the second quarter and first half of 2019 compared to 2018 as the increases in our staffing/interim margins due to the Greater China business disposition in 2018 was offset by the decreases in our permanent recruitment business of 5.4% and 7.4%, respectively (flat and -1.4% in constant currency, respectively). Selling and administrative expenses decreased 0.3% (increase of 3.8% in constant currency and 5.6% in organic constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a result of the disposition of a business unit in Greater China in December 2018, partially offset by an increase in costs to support an increase in revenues in certain markets. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.2% (6.0% in constant currency and 7.9% in organic constant currency) in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in restructuring costs to $4.4 million, incurred in Australia and New Zealand, in the first half of 2019 compared to no restructuring costs incurred in the first half of 2018, and an increase in costs to support an increase in revenues in certain markets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a result of the business unit disposition in Greater China in 2018 and the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. OUP margin for APME decreased to 4.0% in the second quarter of 2019 from 4.1% in 2018 due to expense deleveraging, as were unable to reduce costs at the same rate as the revenue decline, partially offset by the improvement in the gross profit margin. OUP margin decreased to 3.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 3.8% in 2018 due to the increase in restructuring costs, partially offset by the improvement in the gross profit margin. 32 Right Management Revenues from services decreased 3.9% (-0.9% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the 4.7% decrease (-1.7% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced softer demand in our Americas and European markets. Our talent management business decreased 1.7% (increase of 1.3% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand in our Americas and European markets. Revenues from services decreased 6.1% (-2.7% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the 6.0% decrease (-2.6% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced softer demand in our Americas and European markets. Our talent management business decreased 6.8% (-3.1% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due mostly to softening demand in our European and Asia markets and the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Gross profit margin decreased in both the second quarter and first half of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in both our outplacement and talent management businesses gross profit margins. The decrease in the second quarter 2019 compared to 2018 is also due to the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a lower percentage of the revenues mix. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 5.2% (-2.2% in constant currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the decrease in office-related expenses related to a decrease in the number of offices. Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.6% (4.0% in constant currency) in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increase in restructuring costs to $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 from $0.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office-related expenses related to a decrease in the number of offices. OUP margin for Right Management decreased to 17.9% in the second quarter of 2019 from 19.9% in 2018 due to the decline in the gross profit margin. OUP margin decreased to 11.5% in the first half of 2019 from 16.5% in the first half of 2018 due to the increase in restructuring costs and the decline in the gross profit margin. Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. 33 When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of June 30, 2019, we had $661.3 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $277.1 million and $175.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $28.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $114.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the original liability recorded at acquisition date. The increase was partially offset by the lower net proceeds from the sale of our CICE payroll tax credits, which were $103.5 million (€92.0 million) in April 2019 compared to $234.5 million (€190.9 million) in April 2018. Accounts receivable increased to $5,415.6 million as of June 30, 2019 from $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily due to the timing of collections. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") remained unchanged between June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Capital expenditures were $24.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $26.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2018 compared to 2019 was primarily due to additional technology investment and the timing of capital expenditures. On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $212.7 million and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $154.4 million was for cash and cash equivalents. The amounts paid are subject to certain working capital and net debt adjustments based on the actual working capital and net debt existing on the acquisition date compared to target amounts. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG was accounted for as an equity transaction as we previously consolidated the entity. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland was accounted for as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland were included in the June 30, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the results of its operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The aggregate of the consideration paid and the fair value of previously held equity interest totaled $408.3 million, or $90.8 million net of cash acquired. In connection with the business combination, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in Manpower Switzerland of $80.4 million, which is included within interest and other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $80.4 million, $32.5 million represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the previously held equity interest, from accumulated other comprehensive income. 35 From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. The total cash consideration paid for acquisitions excluding Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG , net of cash acquired, was $17.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This balance represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions, of which $13.0 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the total cash consideration for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $47.4 million, the majority of which took place in the Netherlands. This balance includes initial acquisition payments of $8.2 million and contingent consideration payments of $39.2 million, of which $15.1 million had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date. Cash provided by net debt borrowings was $4.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $170.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million or €400.0 million notes. As of June 30, 2019, we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of June 30, 2019. The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other (income) expenses, net, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.83 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.30 to 1 as of June 30, 2019. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of June 30, 2019, such uncommitted credit lines totaled $329.9 million, of which $273.1 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $243.2 million could have been made under these lines as of June 30, 2019. On May 10, 2019 and May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.09 and $1.01 per share, respectively. The 2019 dividends were paid on June 14, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 3, 2019. The 2018 dividends were paid on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018. In August 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock, with terms consistent with the previous authorizations. This authorization is in addition to the August 2018 and July 2016 Board authorizations to purchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock each. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first six months of 2019, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $101.0 million under the 2018 authorization. During the first six months of 2018, we repurchased 1.0 million shares at a cost of $113.2 million under the 2016 authorization. As of June 30, 2019, there were 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2016 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,172.4 million as of June 30, 2019 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,236.4 million as of December 31, 2018. We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling approximately $211.6 million and $190.3 million as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which consist of $160.3 million and $139.0 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.3 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The letters of credit relate to workers’ compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 36 We recorded net restructuring costs of $ 41 . 4 million and $ 39 . 3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , the costs paid, utilized or transferred out of our restructuring reserve was $ 31 . 9 million ($7. 1 million of this amount was transferred to current operating lease liabilities). We expect a majority of the remaining $ 25 . 0 million reserve will be paid , utilized or transferred out by the end of 2019 .

These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, were necessary for a fair statement of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. Leases We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and long-term lease liabilities are presented as separate line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collaterization, lease term, economic environment, currency and other factors. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the related lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include options to renew or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expenses for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subsequent Events On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. Both Manpower Switzerland and Experis AG are reported in our Southern Europe segment. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $212.7 and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 was for the acquired interests and the remaining $154.4 was for cash and cash equivalents. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland will be accounted for as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland will be included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date, and its performance will be included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The major classes of assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland are expected to be cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, current and long-term liabilities, goodwill and other intangible assets (amortizable and non-amortizable) and the funded status of its defined benefit pension plan. The acquisition of the remaining interest of Experis AG will be accounted for as the purchase of a noncontrolling interest as we previously consolidated the entity. 8 On April 11, 2019, we sold a portion of our French payroll tax credits earned in 2018 for net proceeds of $103.5 ( €92.0 ). We derecognized these receivables and the additional interest upon the sale date as the terms of the agreement are such that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment according to the accounting guidance on the transfer and servicing of assets. The discount on the sale of these receivables was recorded in cost of services as a reduction of the payroll tax credits. We have evaluated all other events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date through our filing date and have accrued or disclosed, if appropriate. (2) Recent Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Effective as of January 1, 2019 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued new accounting guidance on leases, ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which we adopted on January 1, 2019. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms longer than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of lease expenses and cash flows depend on the classification by the lessee as a finance or operating lease. We determined that no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was necessary upon adoption. As of the transition date, the ROU asset and total lease liability (current and long-term) were $458.1 and $458.7 , respectively. We elected the package of three practical expedients which lessened the transitional burden of implementing the new guidance. Accordingly, we did not reassess: 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; or 3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on hedge accounting. The amendments in this guidance include the elimination of the concept of recognizing periodic hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges, recognition and presentation of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, recognition and presentation of components excluded from an entity's hedge effectiveness assessment, addition of the ability to elect to perform subsequent effectiveness assessments qualitatively, and addition of new disclosure requirements. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. There was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 14 for the modified disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting comprehensive income. The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""Tax Act""). The guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2019. We elected not to adopt this optional reclassification. In June 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment awards. The guidance makes the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees la rgely consistent with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. T here was no impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to fair value measurements. The guidance is intended to improve the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements by facilitating clearer communication, and it includes multiple new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for internal-use software. The guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The guidance is effective for us in 2020. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures related to defined benefit plans. The guidance amends the current disclosure requirements to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance is effective for us in 2021. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 9 (3) Revenue Recognition For certain client contracts where we recognize revenues over time, we recognize the amount that we have the right to invoice, which corresponds directly to the value provided to the client of our performance to date. We do not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for client contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and those client contracts for which we recognize revenues at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We have other contracts with revenues expected to be recognized subsequent to March 31, 2019 related to remaining performance obligations, which are not material. We record accounts receivable when our right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for services provided that they are conditional on satisfaction of future performance obligations. We record contract liabilities (deferred revenue) when payments are made or due prior to the related performance obligations being satisfied. The current portion of our contract liabilities is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any material contract assets or long-term contract liabilities. Our deferred revenue was $39.2 at March 31, 2019 and $42.8 at December 31, 2018 . The decrease is due to $23.6 of revenues recognized related to amounts that were included in the December 31, 2018 balance, partially offset by payments or amounts due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations in the first three months of 2019. In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by service types for each of our reportable segments.

The expense relates to stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock and performance share units. We recognize share-based compensation expense in selling and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Consideration received from share-based awards was $0.9 and $3.6 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our annual grant of share-based compensation generally takes place during the first quarter of each fiscal year. The number of shares underlying grants to employees and members of our Board of Directors, and the weighted-average fair value per share for shares granted during the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 are presented in the table below: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Shares Granted Wtd.-Avg. Per Share Shares Granted Wtd.-Avg. Per Share (thousands) Fair Value (thousands) Fair Value Stock Options 163 $ 17.78 122 $ 31.46 Deferred Stock Units 20 64.80 10 126.11 Restricted Stock Units 203 78.90 137 117.60 Performance Share Units 136 77.70 94 117.19 Total Shares Granted 522 $ 58.96 363 $ 88.76 (5) Acquisitions From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $0.6 , which represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 , the total cash consideration for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $41.0 , the majority of which took place in the Netherlands. This balance includes initial acquisition payments of $8.2 and contingent consideration payments of $32.8 ( $8.7 of which had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date). On April 26, 2017, the sellers of 7S Group GmbH, a company we acquired in 2015, formally disputed the contingent consideration related to the acquisition and are claiming an additional $23.3 ( €20.8 ), plus interest. The dispute has been heard by an arbitration tribunal in Germany, which is expected to render its decision during 2019. We have vigorously defended these claims in the arbitration, and we believe no further amounts are due. We are not currently able to predict the outcome of the arbitration, and consequently, no amounts have been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 11 (6) Restructuring Costs We recorded net restructuring costs of $39.8 and $24.0 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we made payments and reclassifications of $22.1 out of our restructuring reserve. We expect a majority of the remaining $33.2 reserve will be paid or utilized by the end of 2019 . Changes in the restructuring reserve by reportable segment and Corporate are shown below. Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 0.3 $ 1.7 $ 13.1 $ — $ 0.4 $ — $ 15.5 Severance costs 3.8 5.3 16.5 3.5 0.2 1.5 30.8 Office closure costs and other 1.3 0.1 2.2 0.9 4.5 — 9.0 Costs paid, utilized or transferred out (3) (3.5 ) (1.1 ) (11.2 ) (1.5 ) (4.8 ) — (22.1 ) Balance, March 31, 2019 $ 1.9 $ 6.0 $ 20.6 $ 2.9 $ 0.3 $ 1.5 $ 33.2 (1) Balances related to the United States were $0.3 and $1.3 as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. (2) Balances related to France were $0.9 as of both December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 . Balances related to Italy were $0.5 and $2.3 as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. (3) Restructuring reserve of $7.6 was transferred to current operating lease liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2019. (7) Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 42.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , as compared to an effective rate of 29.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 . The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, and the recognition of valuation allowances against certain tax losses. The 42.8% effective tax rate in the quarter was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, restructuring costs recorded in the quarter, our overall mix of earnings and the recognition of valuation allowances against certain tax losses. As of March 31, 2019 , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $35.0 that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2018 , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to various tax jurisdictions, including interest and penalties, of $34.2 . We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. We conduct business globally in various countries and territories. We are routinely audited by the tax authorities of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Generally, the tax years that could be subject to examination are 2012 through 2019 for our major operations in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of March 31, 2019 , we are subject to tax audits in Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the United States. We believe that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on earnings. 12 (8) Net Earnings Per Share The calculations of net earnings per share – basic and net earnings per share – diluted were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Net earnings available to common shareholders $ 53.5 $ 97.0 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 60.6 66.3 Effect of dilutive securities - stock options — 0.2 Effect of other share-based awards 0.4 0.4 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 61.0 66.9 Net earnings per share - basic $ 0.88 $ 1.46 Net earnings per share - diluted $ 0.88 $ 1.45 There were 0.6 million and 0.1 million share-based awards excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share – diluted for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. (9) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets as follows: March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Goodwill (1) $ 1,293.6 $ — $ 1,293.6 $ 1,297.1 $ — $ 1,297.1 Intangible assets: Finite-lived: Customer relationships $ 443.1 $ 357.5 $ 85.6 $ 444.8 $ 351.7 $ 93.1 Other 18.1 16.3 1.8 18.5 16.0 2.5 461.2 373.8 87.4 463.3 367.7 95.6 Indefinite-lived: Tradenames (2) 52.0 — 52.0 52.0 — 52.0 Reacquired franchise rights 98.8 — 98.8 98.7 — 98.7 150.8 — 150.8 150.7 — 150.7 Total intangible assets $ 612.0 $ 373.8 $ 238.2 $ 614.0 $ 367.7 $ 246.3 (1) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $513.4 as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . (2) Balances were net of accumulated impairment loss of $139.5 as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Total consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the remainder of 2019 is expected to be $21.6 and in each of the next five years is expected to be as follows: 2020 - $24.1 , 2021 - $13.2 , 2022 - $9.7 , 2023 - $7.6 and 2024 - $6.3 . 13 Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment and Corporate were as follows: Americas (1) Southern Europe (2) Northern Europe APME Right Management Corporate (3) Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 519.9 $ 112.2 $ 435.4 $ 102.0 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,297.1 Goodwill acquired 0.4 — — — — — 0.4 Currency and other impacts 0.8 (1.9 ) (2.8 ) — — — (3.9 ) Balance, March 31, 2019 $ 521.1 $ 110.3 $ 432.6 $ 102.0 $ 62.1 $ 65.5 $ 1,293.6 (1) Balances related to the United States were $476.5 as of both December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 . (2) Balances related to France were $68.9 and $67.4 as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. Balances related to Italy were $4.8 and $4.6 as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. (3) The majority of the Corporate balance relates to goodwill attributable to our acquisition of Jefferson Wells ( $55.5 ) which is now part of the United States reporting unit. For purposes of monitoring our total assets by segment, we do not allocate the Corporate balance to the respective reportable segments as this is commensurate with how we operate our business. We do, however, include these balances within the appropriate reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing. See table below for the breakout of goodwill balances by reporting unit. Goodwill balances by reporting unit were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2019 2018 United States $ 532.0 $ 532.0 Germany 126.9 129.2 Netherlands 109.6 112.0 United Kingdom 95.7 93.7 France 67.4 68.9 Right Management 62.1 62.1 Other reporting units 299.9 299.2 Total goodwill $ 1,293.6 $ 1,297.1 (10) Retirement Plans The components of the net periodic benefit cost for our plans were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, Defined Benefit Pension Plans Retiree Health Care Plan 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost $ 2.5 $ 2.8 $ — $ — Interest cost 3.1 3.0 0.1 0.1 Expected return on assets (2.3 ) (2.8 ) — — Other 0.5 0.4 (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Total benefit cost (credit) $ 3.8 $ 3.4 $ (0.1 ) $ (0.1 ) During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , contributions made to our pension plans were $1.5 and contributions made to our retiree health care plan were $0.3 . During 2019 , we expect to make total contributions of approximately $7.9 to our pension plans and to fund our retiree health care payments as incurred. 14 (11) Shareholders’ Equity The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows: March 31, December 31, 2019 2018 Foreign currency translation $ (253.8 ) $ (223.2 ) Translation gain (loss) on net investment hedge, net of income taxes of $(7.8) and $(12.9), respectively 12.7 (4.7 ) Translation loss on long-term intercompany loans (126.2 ) (137.2 ) Defined benefit pension plans, net of income taxes of $(23.1) and $(23.2), respectively (37.6 ) (37.9 ) Retiree health care plan, net of income taxes of $2.0 for both 2019 and 2018 3.1 3.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (401.8 ) $ (399.8 ) Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, included in total shareholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent amounts related to majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net earnings attributable to these noncontrolling interests are recorded in interest and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded expenses of $1.0 and $1.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Share Repurchases In August 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock. This authorization is in addition to the July 2016 Board authorization to repurchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2019 , we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $101.0 under the 2018 authorization. During the first quarter of 2018 , we repurchased 0.4 million shares at a cost of $50.1 under the 2016 authorization. As of March 31, 2019, there were 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2016 authorization. (12) Interest and Other Expenses Interest and other expenses consisted of the following: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 10.2 $ 13.6 Interest income (1.5 ) (1.2 ) Foreign exchange loss (gain) 2.9 (0.1 ) Miscellaneous expense, net 0.3 3.8 Interest and other expenses $ 11.9 $ 16.1 15 (13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to various market risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary market risks, which are managed through the use of derivative instruments, are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. In certain circumstances, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations. We have historically managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The €400.0 ( $446.9 ) notes due September 2022 and the €500.0 ( $555.5 ) notes due June 2026 were designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of March 31, 2019 . The gain or loss associated with foreign currency translation on these notes is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (""AOCI""), net of taxes. On occasion, forward contracts are also designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The effect of our net investment hedges on AOCI for the three months ended March 31 was as follows: Instrument Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income 2019 2018 (1) Euro Notes $ 22.4 $ (21.2 ) (1) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in the current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September. For both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there was no effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations from our forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. The following tables present the fair value of derivative and non-derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31: Assets Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accounts receivable, net $ — $ — Total instruments $ — $ — Liabilities Balance Sheet Location 2019 2018 Instruments designated as hedges: Euro Notes Long-term debt 1,050.3 819.2 Instruments not designated as hedges: Foreign currency forward contracts Accrued liabilities — — Total instruments $ 1,050.3 $ 819.2 Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was $1,050.3 and $1,052.9 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, compared to a carrying value of $1,002.4 and $1,024.6 , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets were $98.2 and $89.5 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs). 16 (14) Leases We have operating leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 12 years . Our lease agreements may include renewal or termination options for varying periods that are generally at our discretion. In our lease term, we only include those periods related to renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. However, we generally do not include these renewal options as we are not reasonably certain to renew at the lease commencement date. This determination is based on our consideration of certain economic, strategic and other factors that we evaluate at lease commencement date and reevaluate throughout the lease term. Some leases also include options to terminate the leases and we only include those periods beyond the termination date if we are reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. Some leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Rather, variable payments, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in lease expenses recorded in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have lease agreements with both lease and non-lease components that are treated as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses. We have elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. That is, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases. As of March 31, 2019 , we did not have any material additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The components of lease expense were as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 34.7 Short-term lease expense 6.1 Other lease expense (1) $ 5.1 Total lease expense $ 45.9 (1) Other lease expense includes immaterial variable lease expense and sublease income. Other information related to leases was as follows: 3 Months Ended March 31, Supplemental Cash Flows Information 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 30.6 Operating ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 14.4 March 31, Supplemental balance sheet information 2019 Operating Leases Operating lease ROU assets $ 434.0 Operating lease liabilities - current (1) $ 117.8 Operating lease liabilities - long-term $ 319.5 Total operating lease liabilities $ 437.3 (1) Operating lease liabilities - current are included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 5.7 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 2.8 % 17 Maturities of operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: (In millions) Period Ending March 31, 2019 Operating Leases 2019 (excluding the three months ended March 31, 2019) $ 94.1 2020 106.6 2021 80.8 2022 60.9 2023 42.0 2024 30.7 Thereafter 71.7 Total future undiscounted lease payments $ 486.8 Less imputed interest $ (49.5 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 437.3 Maturities of operating leases accounted for under ASC 840 as of December 31, 2018 were as follows: (In millions) Period Ending December 31, 2018 Operating Leases 2019 $ 151.4 2020 115.2 2021 85.5 2022 65.0 2023 44.1 Thereafter 105.6 Total minimum lease payments $ 566.8 (15) Segment Data We are organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis, with Right Management currently operating as a separate global business unit. Each country and business unit generally has its own distinct operations and management team, providing services under our global brands, and maintains its own financial reports. We have an executive sponsor for each global brand who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and consistency of delivery locally. Each operation reports directly or indirectly through a regional manager, to a member of executive management. Given this reporting structure, we operate using the following reporting segments: Americas, which includes United States and Other Americas; Southern Europe, which includes France, Italy and Other Southern Europe; Northern Europe; APME; and Right Management. The Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe and APME segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from our staffing and interim services. The remaining revenues within these segments are derived from our outcome-based solutions and consulting services, permanent recruitment services and other services. The Right Management segment revenues are derived from outplacement and talent management services. Segment revenues represent sales to external clients. We provide services to a wide variety of clients, none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenues for us as a whole. Due to the nature of our business, we generally do not have export sales. 18 3 Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Revenues from services: Americas: United States (a) $ 603.6 $ 616.3 Other Americas 403.7 406.3 1,007.3 1,022.6 Southern Europe: France 1,301.4 1,424.0 Italy 355.9 413.6 Other Southern Europe 444.9 474.4 2,102.2 2,312.0 Northern Europe 1,189.7 1,417.6 APME 699.9 720.2 Right Management 45.8 50.0 Consolidated (b) $ 5,044.9 $ 5,522.4 Operating unit profit: (c) Americas: United States $ 16.4 $ 26.7 Other Americas 14.8 16.2 31.2 42.9 Southern Europe: France 55.5 57.7 Italy 20.4 25.2 Other Southern Europe 11.0 14.8 86.9 97.7 Northern Europe 0.6 16.6 APME 20.1 25.9 Right Management 2.1 6.4 140.9 189.5 Corporate expenses (27.9 ) (26.8 ) Intangible asset amortization expense (7.5 ) (8.9 ) Operating profit 105.5 153.8 Interest and other expenses (11.9 ) (16.1 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 93.6 $ 137.7 (a) In the United States, revenues from services included fees received from the related franchise offices of $3.6 and $3.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $156.9 and $149.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (b) Our consolidated revenues from services include fees received from our franchise offices of $5.6 and $5.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise offices, which were $243.0 and $236.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (c) We evaluate segment performance based on operating unit profit (“OUP”), which is equal to segment revenues less cost of services and branch and national headquarters operating costs. This profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, corporate expenses, interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes. 19 Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations See the financial measures section on page 25 for further information on the Non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and organic constant currency. Business Overview Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. Whereas, during periods of decreased demand, as we experienced in the first quarter of 2019, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. During the first quarter of 2019, t he United States dollar was stronger, on average, relative to the currencies in all of our markets, particularly those markets within Europe, having an unfavorable impact on our reported results. While our reported revenues from services decreased 8.6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and our reported operating profit decreased 31.4% , these results were partly impacted by the relative weakness of other currencies against the United States dollar compared to the same period in 2018, and generally may understate the performance of our underlying business. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 6.4% unfavorable impact on revenues from services, a 5.4% unfavorable impact on operating profit, and an approximately $0.12 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share – diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. In the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we experienced constant currency revenue declines in most of our markets. Our consolidated revenues were down 2.2% in constant currency in the quarter, a deterioration from the 0.7% constant currency decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 due primarily to the differences in the number of billing days. After adjusting for billing days, our organic constant currency revenue decrease was 1.1% compared to a 2.5% decrease in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our first quarter results reflect a stabilization of the economic slowdown experienced in the second half of 2018 in certain markets within Southern and Northern Europe, which when combined represents approximately 65% of our total consolidated revenues. The revenue decrease in Northern Europe was primarily due to the decrease in Germany resulting from the continued challenges posed by new regulations, the implementation of new systems and actions taken to optimize our delivery channels that caused some client disruption during the third quarter of 2018, as well as softer demand from the manufacturing sector in that market. We experienced a revenue decline in Southern Europe due to the constant currency revenue decline in France, flat after adjusting for billing days, and constant currency revenue growth in certain markets within Other Southern Europe. In the Americas, revenues increased 3.0% in constant currency due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within Other Americas, a 5.3% constant currency increase in our permanent recruitment business, and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business. These increases were partially offset by 2.1% decrease in the United States primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. In APME, revenues increased 1.9% in constant currency primarily due to an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues. Our gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2019 was flat compared to 2018 as the increase in our permanent recruitment business contribution was offset by the decline in our staffing/interim gross profit margin due to business mix changes in various countries. We recorded $39.8 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2019, comprised of $5.1 million in the Americas, $5.4 million in Southern Europe, $18.7 million in Northern Europe, $4.4 million in APME, $4.7 million in Right Management, and $1.5 million in corporate expenses. The restructuring costs were primarily related to our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations. Our operating profit decreased in the first quarter of 2019 by 31.4% ( -26.0% in constant currency) while our operating profit margin was down 70 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018 . Excluding the restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018, our operating profit was down 11.5% in constant currency while operating profit margin was down 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018 . We continue to monitor expenses closely to ensure we maintain the benefit of our efforts to optimize our organizational and cost structures, while investing appropriately to support the growth in the business and enhance our productivity and technology and digital capabilities. 20 Operating Results - Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 . (in millions, except per share data ) 2019 2018 Variance Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services $ 5,044.9 $ 5,522.4 -8.6 % -2.2 % Cost of services 4,240.1 4,637.0 -8.6 -2.0 Gross profit 804.8 885.4 -9.1 -3.0 Gross profit margin 16.0 % 16.0 % Selling and administrative expenses 699.3 731.6 -4.4 1.9 Operating profit 105.5 153.8 -31.4 -26.0 Operating profit margin 2.1 % 2.8 % Interest and other expenses 11.9 16.1 -26.6 Earnings before income taxes 93.6 137.7 -32.0 -26.5 Provision for income taxes 40.1 40.7 -1.4 Effective income tax rate 42.8 % 29.6 % Net earnings $ 53.5 $ 97.0 -44.8 -40.4 Net earnings per share – diluted $ 0.88 $ 1.45 -39.3 -34.5 Weighted average shares – diluted 61.0 66.9 -8.9 % The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 8.6% ( -2.2% in constant currency and -1.5% in organic constant currency) was attributed to: • a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of 9.1% ( -1.6% in constant currency). This included a revenue decrease in France of 8.6% ( -1.1% in constant currency) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day. The Southern Europe decrease also included a decrease in Italy of 14.0% ( -6.9% in constant currency) due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 7.4% increase ( 16.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business; • decreased demand for services in several of our markets within Northern Europe, where revenues decreased 16.1% ( -8.8% in constant currency and -8.2% in organic constant currency), primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services. We experienced revenue declines in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Nordics of 29.1% , 27.6% , 12.1% , 10.7% , and 6.1% ( -23.2% , -21.7% , -4.9% , -4.7% , and an increase of 4.0% , respectively, in constant currency; -18.0% in organic constant currency in the Netherlands); • a revenue decrease in the United States of 2.1% primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day; • a revenue decrease in APME of 2.8% (increase of 1.9% in constant currency) due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our Manpower staffing revenues; • decreased demand for services at Right Management, where revenues decreased 8.4% ( -4.5% in constant currency), including a 7.2% decrease ( -3.5% in constant currency) in our outplacement services, as well as a 12.3% decrease ( -7.9% in constant currency) in our talent management business; • our dispositions in Northern Europe and APME at the end of December 2018, which contributed approximately 0.7% of revenue decline to our consolidated results on a constant currency basis; and • a 6.4% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. The gross profit margin remained flat year-over-year as a 10 basis point favorable impact due to a larger mix of services coming from our permanent recruitment business was offset by a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the decline in our staffing/interim margin due to business mix changes in various countries as well as lower associate utilization and higher vacation and sickness rates in Germany. 21 The 4.4% decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 (increase of 1.9% in constant currency and 2.2% in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: • a 9.8% decrease (-3.8% in constant currency; -3.5% in organic constant currency) in office-related costs primarily due to a decrease in the number of offices as a result of our delivery channel and other front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities, as well as adjusting our cost-base for the slower market environment in many of our European operations ; • a $2.8 million decrease in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of dispositions in December 2018 in Northern Europe and APME; and • a 6.3% decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; partially offset by • restructuring costs of $39.8 million incurred in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $24.0 million incurred in the first quarter of 2018. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased 70 basis points in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from the increase in restructuring costs, a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from expense deleveraging as we were unable to decrease expenses at the same rate as our revenue decline, and a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Interest and other expenses are comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including noncontrolling interests. Interest and other expenses were $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $16.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 . Net interest expense decreased $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 to $8.7 million from $12.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to the lower interest rate on our €500.0 million notes offered and sold in June 2018 compared to the interest rate on the €350.0 million notes due June 22, 2018 that were repaid in June 2018. Foreign exchange losses in the first quarter of 2019 were $2.9 million compared to income of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in foreign exchange losses was primarily due to the $2.3 million translation loss in Argentina as a result of the highly-inflationary designation of its economy as of July 1, 2018. Miscellaneous expenses were $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 . The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 42.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , as compared to an effective rate of 29.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 . The 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the French CICE subsidy, which was non-taxable, to new French subsidies in January 2019 that are taxable, and the recognition of valuation allowances against certain tax losses. The 42.8% effective tax rate in the quarter was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the French business tax, restructuring costs recorded in the quarter, our overall mix of earnings and the recognition of valuation allowances against certain tax losses. Net earnings per share - diluted was $0.88 and $1.45 in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2019 . Restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $0.51 and $0.27 per share, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Weighted average shares - diluted decreased 8.9% to 61.0 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 66.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 . This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards since the first quarter of 2018. Segment Operating Results Americas In the Americas, revenues from services decreased 1.5% (increase of 3.0% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 . In the United States, revenues from services decreased 2.1% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, partially offset by a 4.9% increase in our permanent recruitment business and an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business, primarily within our MSP offering. In Other Americas, revenues from services decreased 0.6% (increase of 10.7% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 . We experienced revenue growth in Mexico, Canada, Colombia, and Peru of 4.4% , 7.7% , 1.6% , and 10.5% , respectively ( 7.0% , 13.2% , 11.4% , and 13.4% , respectively, in constant currency). These increases were partially offset by decreases in Argentina and Brazil of 41.7% and 1.0% , respectively (increases of 15.5% and 14.8% , respectively, in constant currency). The constant currency increase in Argentina was primarily due to inflation. There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in the last few years. As of July 1, 2018, the Argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018. 22 Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to business mix changes within our s taffing/interim business, as a larger percentage of our revenues came from our lower-margin entities within Other Americas. This decrease was partially offset by an improved staffing/interim margin in the United States, due to pricing discipline and lower payroll tax and insurance costs, as well as an increase of 3.1% ( 5.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In the first quarter of 2019 , selling and administrative expenses increased 5.3% ( 9.6% in constant currency), due primarily to an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount related to growth initiatives, increased costs as a result of investment in certain technology and back-office and delivery channel optimization activities in the United States, and an increase in restructuring costs to $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating Unit Profit (“OUP”) margin in the Americas was 3.1% and 4.2% for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In the United States, OUP margin decreased to 2.7% in the first quarter of 2019 from 4.3% in 2018 . The margin decrease in 2019 in the United States was primarily due to the restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2019 and increased costs as a result of headcount increases for growth initiatives, investment in certain technology and back-office and delivery channel optimization activities. Other Americas OUP margin decreased to 3.7% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 4.0% in 2018 due to the increase in restructuring costs. Southern Europe In Southern Europe, which includes operations in France and Italy, revenues from services decreased 9.1% ( -1.6% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 . In the first quarter of 2019 , revenues from services decreased 8.6% ( -1.1% in constant currency) in France (which represents 62% of Southern Europe’s revenues) and decreased 14.0% ( -6.9% in constant currency) in Italy (which represents 17% of Southern Europe’s revenues). The decrease in France is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the unfavorable impact of approximately one fewer billing day, partially offset by a constant currency increase in our permanent recruitment business of 5.8% ( -2.3% as reported). The decrease in Italy was due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services as a result of a challenging economic environment, partially offset by a 7.4% increase ( 16.3% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. In Other Southern Europe, revenues from services decreased 6.2% (increase of 1.5% in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 , due to the unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business and the constant currency increase in our permanent recruitment business of 4.8% ( -3.7% as reported). Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the increase in France's staffing/interim margin as a result of favorable pricing actions, favorable direct costs adjustments and various initiatives to offset the unfavorable impact from transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transition of the CICE program to a new subsidy program. The Southern Europe gross profit margin also increased due to growth in our higher-margin ManpowerGroup Solutions business and a 7.9% constant currency increase ( -0.5% as reported) in the permanent recruitment business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Italy's Manpower staffing margin primarily due to the loss of certain subsidies . Selling and administrative expenses decreased 5.7% (increase of 2.1% in constant currency) during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in salary-related expenses, as a result of higher headcount, and an increase of restructuring costs to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. OUP margin in Southern Europe was 4.1% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 4.2% for 2018 . In France, the OUP margin increased to 4.3% for the first quarter of 2019 from 4.1% in 2018 , primarily due to the improvement in the gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in salary-related expenses. In Italy, the OUP margin decreased to 5.7% for the first quarter of 2019 from 6.1% for 2018 , primarily due to the increase in restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in the gross profit margin. Other Southern Europe’s OUP margin decreased to 2.5% for the first quarter of 2019 from 3.1% in 2018 , due to a decline in the gross profit margin and the increase in restructuring costs. Northern Europe In Northern Europe, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium (comprising 32% , 18% , 21% , 12% , and 8% , respectively, of Northern Europe’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 16.1% ( -8.8% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 . We experienced revenue declines in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and Belgium of 10.7% , 29.1% , 6.1% , 27.6% and 12.1% ( -4.7% , -23.2% , increase of 4.0% , -21.7% and -4.9% , respectively, in constant currency). The Northern Europe revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced demand for our Manpower staffing services, primarily because of the decrease in Germany resulting from lower production activity in the manufacturing sector in that market, decrease in the UK due to reduced production from one of our automotive clients, and reduced demand in the Netherlands. This decrease was also due to a decrease in our ManpowerGroup Solutions business from the disposition of our language translation business in the Netherlands at the end of December 2018 and the 14.5% decrease ( -7.0% in constant currency) in the permanent recruitment business. These decreases were partially offset an 23 increased demand for our staffing/interim services in Norway as well as a constant currency increase in our Experis interim business primarily within the IT sector in the United Kingdom. Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decline in our staffing/interim margin, primarily as a result of business mix changes, lower associate utilization and higher vacation and sickness rates in Germany, and the decrease in our permanent recruitment business . Selling and administrative expenses decreased 14.3% ( -6.8% in constant currency; -6.2% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a decrease in organic salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount, a decrease in office-related expenses driven by a decrease in the number of offices, and a decrease in consulting costs related to certain technology projects, front-office centralization and back-office optimization activities incurred in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease is also due to the decrease of restructuring costs to $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $20.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. The 2019 restructuring costs related to delivery model and other front-office centralization activities as well as back-office optimization activities primarily in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium. OUP margin for Northern Europe for the first quarter of 2019 decreased to 0.1% compared to 1.2% in 2018 . The decrease in the OUP margin was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit margin, as well as deleveraging, as we were unable to reduce costs at the same rate as the revenue decline. APME Revenues from services decreased 2.8% (increase of 1.9% in constant currency and 5.9% in organic constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 . In Japan (which represents 33% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services increased 0.9% ( 2.8% in constant currency) due to the increased demand for our staffing/interim services and a 11.5% increase ( 13.7% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of one fewer billing day in the quarter. In Australia (which represents 18% of APME’s revenues), revenues from services decreased 13.3% ( -4.4% in constant currency) as we chose to exit out of certain low-margin business to improve profitability, and due to the 13.0% decrease ( -4.0% in constant currency) in our permanent recruitment business. The slight revenue decrease in the remaining markets in APME is due to the disposition of a low-margin business in Greater China at the end of December 2018, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services, mostly in India, Greater China, Thailand, and Singapore. Gross profit margin remained flat in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 as the increase in our staffing/interim margin due to the Greater China business disposition in 2018 was offset by the decrease in our permanent recruitment business of 9.5% ( -2.9% in constant currency). Selling and administrative expenses increased 2.9% ( 8.4% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to an increase in restructuring costs to $4.4 million, incurred in Australia and New Zealand, in first quarter of 2019 compared to no restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2018, and the increase in organic salary-related costs due to higher headcount, which supported the constant currency increase in revenues. These increases were offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a result of the Greater China business disposition in 2018. OUP margin for APME decreased to 2.9% in the first quarter of 2019 from 3.6% in 2018 due to the restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2019. Right Management Revenues from services decreased 8.4% ( -4.5% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 . The decrease is primarily due to the 7.2% decrease ( -3.5% in constant currency) in our outplacement services as we experienced softer demand in our Americas and European markets. Our talent management business decreased 12.3% ( -7.9% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due mostly to softening demand across all markets. Gross profit margin decreased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in both our outplacement and talent management businesses gross profit margins, partially offset by the change in business mix as the higher-margin outplacement business represented a higher percentage of the revenues mix . Selling and administrative expenses increased 6.1% ( 9.9% in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the increase of restructuring costs to $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by a decrease in salary-related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office-related expenses related to a decrease in the number of offices. OUP margin for Right Management decreased to 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019 from 12.9% in 2018 due to the increase in restructuring costs and the decline in the gross profit margin. 24 Financial Measures Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide “constant currency” and “organic constant currency” calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. When we use the term “constant currency,” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. When we use the term “organic constant currency,” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business. The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below: 3 Months Ended March 31, 2019 Compared to 2018 Reported Amount (a) Reported Variance Impact of Currency Constant Currency Variance Impact of Acquisitions and Dispositions (In Constant Currency) Organic Constant Currency Variance Revenues from services: Americas: United States $ 603.6 (2.1 )% — % (2.1 )% — % (2.1 )% Other Americas 403.7 (0.6 ) (11.3 ) 10.7 — 10.7 1,007.3 (1.5 ) (4.5 ) 3.0 — 3.0 Southern Europe: France 1,301.4 (8.6 ) (7.5 ) (1.1 ) — (1.1 ) Italy 355.9 (14.0 ) (7.1 ) (6.9 ) — (6.9 ) Other Southern Europe 444.9 (6.2 ) (7.7 ) 1.5 — 1.5 2,102.2 (9.1 ) (7.5 ) (1.6 ) — (1.6 ) Northern Europe 1,189.7 (16.1 ) (7.3 ) (8.8 ) (0.6 ) (8.2 ) APME 699.9 (2.8 ) (4.7 ) 1.9 (4.0 ) 5.9 Right Management 45.8 (8.4 ) (3.9 ) (4.5 ) — (4.5 ) Consolidated $ 5,044.9 (8.6 ) (6.4 ) (2.2 ) (0.7 ) (1.5 ) Gross Profit $ 804.8 (9.1 ) (6.1 ) (3.0 ) (0.5 ) (2.5 ) Selling and Administrative Expenses $ 699.3 (4.4 ) (6.3 ) 1.9 (0.3 ) 2.2 Operating Profit $ 105.5 (31.4 ) (5.4 ) (26.0 ) (0.6 ) (25.4 ) (a) In millions for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany lending, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of March 31, 2019 , we had $363.5 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. With the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we no longer recorded United States federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. However, we do record deferred tax liabilities related to non-United States withholding and other taxes on unremitted earnings that are not considered permanently invested. Cash provided by operating activities was $101.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to cash used in operating activities of $58.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 . Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $11.9 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $177.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 . These changes are primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments and the contingent consideration of $24.1 million paid in 2018 in excess of the contingent consideration liabilities initially recognized on the acquisition date. Accounts receivable decreased to $5,186.3 million as of March 31, 2019 from $5,276.1 million as of December 31, 2018 . This decrease is primarily due to the revenue decline and changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO""). DSO increased by approximately two days from December 31, 2018 due primarily to unfavorable mix changes, as countries with a higher average DSO represented a higher percentage of our consolidated revenues. Capital expenditures were $10.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $12.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 . These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The higher expenditures in 2018 compared to 2019 was primarily due to additional technology investment and the timing of capital expenditures. From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $0.6 million, which represents contingent consideration payments related to previous acquisitions. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 , the total cash consideration for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $41.0 million, the majority of which took place in the Netherlands. This balance includes initial acquisition payments of $8.2 million and contingent consideration payments of $32.8 million ( $8.7 million of which had been recognized as a liability at the acquisition date). Cash provided by net debt borrowings was $2.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to net debt repayments of $4.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 . Our €500.0 million notes and €400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and September 2022, respectively. When the notes mature, we plan to repay the amounts with available cash, borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets should we decide to replace either the €500.0 million notes or the €400.0 million notes. As of March 31, 2019 , we had letters of credit totaling $0.5 million issued under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility. Additional borrowings of $599.5 million were available to us under the facility as of March 31, 2019 . The $600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense (""EBITDA"")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.03 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.32 to 1 as of March 31, 2019. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of March 31, 2019 , such uncommitted credit lines totaled $318.9 million, of which $265.5 million was unused. Under the Credit Agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed $300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and $600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. Due to these limitations, additional borrowings of $246.6 million could have been made under these lines as of March 31, 2019. 26 In August 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 6.0 million shares of our common stock. This authorization is in addition to the July 2016 Board authorization to repurchase 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the first quarter of 2019 , we repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares at a cost of $101.0 million under the 2018 authorization. During the first quarter of 2018 , we repurchased 0.4 million shares at a cost of $50.1 million under the 2016 authorization. As of March 31, 2019, there were 1.9 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2016 authorization. We had aggregate commitments of $2,102.8 as of March 31, 2019 related to debt, operating leases, severances and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to $2,236.4 million as of December 31, 2018 . We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling approximately $184.2 million and $190.3 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, which consist of $132.9 million and $139.0 million for guarantees, respectively, and $51.3 million for stand-by letters of credit as of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Guarantees primarily relate to bank accounts, operating leases and indebtedness. The letters of credit relate to workers’ compensation, operating leases and indebtedness. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit was $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We recorded net restructuring costs of $39.8 million and $24.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to severances and office closures and consolidations in multiple countries and territories. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we made payments, utilized or transferred $22.1 million out of our restructuring reserve ($7.6 million of this amount was transferred to current operating lease liabilities). We expect a majority of the remaining $33.2 million reserve will be paid by the end of 2019. Subsequent Event (Acquisition of remaining interests in Switzerland) On April 3, 2019, we acquired the remaining 51% controlling interest in our Swiss franchise (“Manpower Switzerland”) to obtain full ownership of the entity. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Experis AG. Manpower Switzerland provides contingent staffing services under our Manpower brand in the four main language regions in Switzerland. The aggregate cash consideration paid was $212.7 million and was funded through cash on hand. Of the total consideration paid, $58.3 million was for the acquired interests and the remaining $154.4 million was for cash and cash equivalents. Our investment in Manpower Switzerland prior to the acquisition was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we recorded our share of equity income or loss in interest and other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition of the remaining controlling interest in Manpower Switzerland will be accounted for as a business combination and the assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland will be included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the acquisition date, and its performance will be included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the acquisition date. The major classes of assets and liabilities of Manpower Switzerland are expected to be cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, current and long-term liabilities, goodwill and other intangible assets (amortizable and non-amortizable) and the funded status of its defined benefit pension plan. The acquisition of the remaining interest in Experis AG will be accounted for as the purchase of a noncontrolling interest as we previously consolidated the entity. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Forward-Looking Statements Statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2023. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2024 is a 53-week period ending June 29, 2024, and our fiscal 2023 was a 52-week period ending on June 24, 2023. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 14-week and 13-week periods for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. For simplicity, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates including, but not limited to, those estimates related to revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current period developments, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Prepayment of Intangible Assets and Asset Acquisition During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an amendment to our wireless license agreement with Avago Technologies (“Broadcom”), to license four developed technology products and to extend the exclusivity period of certain developed technologies that were previously licensed from Broadcom in July 2020. As of September 2023, we have not obtained control of the four technology products and, accordingly, the relative fair value of these technology products are presented as a non-current asset in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The technologies included in the agreement do not constitute a business and, as such, we accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of an asset in accordance with the applicable guidance when we receive control of the developed technology . Refer to “Note 4. Prepayment of Intangible Assets and Asset Acquisition” for further discussion of the transaction. Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities” which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination by providing consistent recognition guidance. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal 2024 and it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. We early adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 9 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 2. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Most of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Rights to our intellectual property, or IP, are either sold or licensed to customers. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occurs, or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. To date, there have been no material credit loss charges recorded on accounts receivable. As of September 2023, and June 2023, contract assets recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets were $ 8.2 million and $ 1.3 , respectively. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 18.7 million and $ 37.2 million, respectively, as of September 2023, and $ 18.7 million and $ 39.8 million, respectively, as of June 2023. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 10 Balance Sheet Components. During the three months ended September 2023 and September 2022, we recognized $ 2.4 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of such fiscal year. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and product category is presented in Note 15. Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Numerator: Net (loss) income $ ( 55.6 ) $ 64.6 Denominator: Shares, basic 38.8 39.8 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes - 0.9 Shares, diluted 38.8 40.7 Net (loss) income per share: Basic $ ( 1.43 ) $ 1.62 Diluted $ ( 1.43 ) $ 1.59 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share. 4. Prepayment of Intangible Assets and Asset Acquisition During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we paid an aggregate consideration of $ 130.0 million to Broadcom to extend the exclusivity period of certain previously acquired intangible assets for an additional three-year period and to license certain developed technology intangible assets. The developed technologies are expected to be delivered at various dates through August 2025. The purchase consideration allocated to the extension of the exclusivity period was $ 13.5 million and was recorded as a developed technology intangible asset in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 . This intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated economic useful life of three years. The remaining balance of the purchase consideration, totaling $ 116.5 million relating to the four technology products to be received at future dates, has been recorded as a prepayment of intangible assets. This prepayment is 10 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) classified under non-current other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Upon obtaining control of the developed technologies, the amounts recorded under non-current other assets will be reclassified as intangible assets based on their respective fair values determined as of the agreement date. 5 . Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): September June 2023 2023 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 75.4 $ 70.5 Finished goods 56.3 66.7 $ 131.7 $ 137.2 Inventories are recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis. We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 6 . Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by category at September 2023 and June 2023 (in millions): September 2023 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized loss Fair Value Cash $ 323.6 $ — $ 323.6 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 426.7 — 426.7 Certificates of deposit 51.0 — 51.0 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 801.3 $ — $ 801.3 Short-term investments: Treasury bills $ 16.6 $ — $ 16.6 Corporate debt securities 5.6 ( 0.1 ) 5.5 Municipal bonds 1.0 — 1.0 Total short-term investments $ 23.2 $ ( 0.1 ) $ 23.1 June 2023 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized loss Fair Value Cash $ 853.9 $ — $ 853.9 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 54.4 — 54.4 Treasury bills 16.4 — 16.4 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 924.7 $ — $ 924.7 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 0.2 $ — $ 0.2 Corporate debt securities 6.5 ( 0.2 ) 6.3 Municipal bonds 3.1 — 3.1 Total short-term investments $ 9.8 $ ( 0.2 ) $ 9.6 11 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The following table classifies our short-term investments by contractual maturities (in millions): September 2023 June 2023 Amortized cost Fair value Amortized cost Fair value Due within 1 year $ 23.2 $ 23.1 $ 9.8 $ 9.6 Due between 1 year to 5 years — — — — $ 23.2 $ 23.1 $ 9.8 $ 9.6 7 . Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets, and the fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. At September 2023 and June 2023, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions): September 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Total (1) Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 426.7 $ — $ 426.7 Certificates of deposit — 51.0 51.0 Short-term investments: Treasury bills 16.6 — 16.6 Corporate debt securities — 5.5 5.5 Municipal bonds — 1.0 1.0 Total assets $ 443.3 $ 57.5 $ 500.8 (1) Excludes $ 323.6 million in cash held in our bank accounts as of September 2023.

We did not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility, as defined in Note 12. Debt. The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility was determined based on the trading price of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility are as follows for the periods presented (in millions): September 2023 June 2023 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Senior Notes due 2029 $ 395.8 $ 328.5 $ 395.6 $ 337.2 Term Loan Facility due 2028 579.8 578.4 $ 582.4 $ 575.3 $ 975.6 $ 906.9 $ 978.0 $ 912.5 8 .

Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal 2034 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years . For the three months ended September 2023 and September 2022, we recorded operating lease expense of approximately $ 2.9 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively. Our short-term leases are immaterial. As of September 2023 and June 2023, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): September June 2023 2023 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 47.8 $ 49.0 Operating lease liabilities $ 9.0 $ 9.0 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 40.9 42.4 Total operating lease liabilities $ 49.9 $ 51.4 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases, including from acquisitions, is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 2.3 $ 2.7 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets $ 1.2 $ 1.4 As of September 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term is 7.26 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 5.19 % .

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not, and will not, infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. While we currently believe that resolving claims against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. 16 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 12. Debt Senior Notes On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense through the maturity date . The total interest expense and amortization of the debt issuance costs recorded on the Senior Notes during the three months ended September 2023 and 2022 was $ 4.1 million in each period. Revolving Credit Facility On March 16, 2023, we entered into a Second Amendment, or the Second Amendment, and on July 28, 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment, or the Third Amendment, to our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, dated March 11, 17 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 2021. The Second Amendment replaces the LIBOR-based interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement with a SOFR-based interest rate, and the Third Amendment provides that the consolidated interest coverage ratio financial covenant only applies if, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, our aggregate cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $ 450 million. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 2023 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Amended Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement bears interest, at our election, of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the Second Amendment, plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or Adjusted Term SOFR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for Adjusted Term SOFR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, which, after the Third Amendment, only applies if our cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $ 450 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. If our quarter-end cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $ 450.0 million, the interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 as of the date of determination. As of September 2023 , we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility accrue interest at the SOFR, plus 2.25 %, or at the Base Rate plus 1.25 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to an Adjusted Term SOFR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 %, (ii) the Prime Rate and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00 %. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense and amortization of the debt 18 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) issuance costs recorded on the Term Loan Facility during the three months ended September 2023 and 2022 was $ 11.8 million and $ 6.9 million, respectively. 13. Share-Based Compensation Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated, and t he cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders is 6,188,000 as of October 24, 2023. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. No new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Cost of revenue $ 1.1 $ 1.1 Research and development 15.2 14.0 Selling, general, and administrative 16.9 17.5 Total $ 33.2 $ 32.6 Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Research and development $ — $ 1.5 Selling, general, and administrative — 0.6 Total $ — $ 2.1 19 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The final vesting of the phantom stock units occurred in October 2022, and no phantom stock units remain outstanding under this plan. Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plan Activity Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Option Average Awards Exercise Outstanding Price Balance as of June 2023 3,083 $ 52.53 Exercised ( 3,083 ) Expired Balance as of September 2023 — Restricted Stock Units RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date.

Market Stock Units An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2023 227,321 Granted 303,802 Delivered ( 223,984 ) Forfeited ( 59,988 ) Balance as of September 2023 247,151 $ 22.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 29, 2023, of $ 89.44 . 20 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis by tranche. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 45.4 million as of September 2023, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. Performance Stock Units A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2023 253,359 Granted 282,353 Delivered ( 107,785 ) Forfeited ( 63,126 ) Balance as of September 2023 364,801 $ 32.6 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 29, 2023, of $ 89.44 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis . The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any period related to PSUs can vary based on the achievement or anticipated achievement of the performance conditions. If the performance conditions are not met or not expected to be met, no compensation cost would be recognized on the underlying PSUs, and any previously recognized compensation expense related to those PSUs would be reversed. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 21.7 million as of September 2023, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.4 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the three months ended September 2023, were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 110,836 Weighted average purchase price $ 75.11 Cash received $ 8.3 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 1.5 14. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. 21 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The provision for income taxes of $ 15.0 million and $ 39.1 million for the three months ended September 2023 and 2022, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 2023 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, foreign income taxed at higher rates and non-deductible officer compensation. This was partially offset by research credits and a one-time benefit from prior year creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from U.S. Treasury Notice 2023-55, which was issued in July 2023 and provided us a one-year delay of the effective date of U.S. final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions decreased $ 4.4 million during the three months ended September 2023, to $ 39.3 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 2023 were $ 3.1 million; this balance increased by $ 0.1 million compared to June 2023. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2016 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 15. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. In previous reporting periods, we categorized revenues from three product catego ries: the IoT product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will now categorize our revenues in the following product categories: Core IoT, Enterprise and Automotive, and Mobile product applications. The primary reason for the change in the product group names was to align external reporting groups with the strategic focus of the Company on a go-forward basis. A summary of our products and how they are categorized under our new product categories is as follows: Revenues for the three months ended September 2022 from our previous product categories have been reclassified in order to conform to the current period presentation as follows: Core IoT Enterprise and Auto Mobile Total IoT product applications $ 342.7 $ 113.4 $ 229.3 $ — $ 342.7 PC product applications 65.2 — 65.2 — 65.2 Mobile product applications 40.2 — — 40.2 40.2 $ 448.1 $ 113.4 $ 294.5 $ 40.2 $ 448.1 22 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Net revenue from our customers for each product category was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Enterprise and Automotive product applications $ 154.8 $ 294.5 Core IoT product applications 38.5 113.4 Mobile product applications 44.4 40.2 $ 237.7 $ 448.1 Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 China/Hong Kong $ 106.6 $ 114.5 Taiwan 36.9 180.7 Japan 52.6 106.3 Other 14.1 36.6 South Korea 11.7 5.6 United States 15.8 4.4 $ 237.7 $ 448.1 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Customer A * 13 % Customer B 18 % * Customer C 11 % * ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: September June 2023 2023 Customer A * 10 % Customer B 13 % 20 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % Additionally, as of September 2023 , three other customer accounts receivable balances cumulatively totaled 35 % of total accounts receivable. 16. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of unrealized gains or losses on our available-for-sale securities. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 17. Restructuring Activities In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated restructuring actions primarily intended to focus on key growth initiatives, reduce costs and align our business in response to market conditions. As a result of this restructuring, we expect to incur approximately $ 10.0 23 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) million in restructuring charges and expect to complete the restructuring by the end of fiscal 2024. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the restructuring activity and related charges during the periods presented (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 Balance, beginning of period $ — $ 1.4 Charges 8.0 — Payments ( 6.0 ) ( 1.2 ) Balance, end of period $ 2.0 $ 0.2 During the three months ended September 2023, the restructuring and related charges of $ 8.0 million was primarily attributable to severance and employee-related benefits. 24 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to the following: our dependence on our solutions for the Core IoT and Enterprise and Automotive product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for Core IoT and Enterprise and Automotive product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; regional instabilities and hostilities (including the war in Israel) and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2023, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Nearly all of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occurs, or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. In the past, when supply constraints and capacity shortages have impacted the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; 25 backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and the provision for excess and obsolete inventories to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of developed technology, customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. See Note 17. Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes (as defined herein), Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Acquisitions Broadcom In July 2023, we entered into a transaction with Broadcom to extend the exclusivity period of certain developed technologies, and to license certain technology assets for an aggregate consideration of $130.0 million, which was paid in cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Emza On October 25, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza for total purchase consideration of $15.8 million, which was paid in cash. The results of Emza are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from October 25, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended September 2023, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2023. Trends and Uncertainties Current Economic Conditions The frequency and amplitude in which central banks raise interest rates has subsided relative to the first half of calendar year 2023, but the impact has had a material effect on many sectors of the economy leading to broad-based workforce reductions, a slowing or deferral of investment in information technology spending, and increased concern of a global recession. We believe the threat of global recession is the primary driver for the slowdown in orders from our customer base. During the quarter, we continued to experience a broad reduction in demand in most of our product applications as many customers and channel partners continue to consume their accumulation of inventories, combined with customer requests to delay orders. We continue to believe that the demand slowdown is temporary, but the rebound in demand is likely to extend beyond calendar 2023, and potentially beyond 2024. In addition, although we currently do not believe inflation in the costs of goods and services will have a material impact on our results of operations, it is possible that rising inflation could increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income. Further, rising interest rates have increased our borrowing costs on our variable rate Term Loan Facility, which will continue to drive an increase in interest 26 costs in future accounting periods and potentially limit our borrowing capacity if a future acquisition opportunity requiring financing presents itself. The War between Israel and Hamas The uncertainty resulting from the war in Israel and the threat for expansion of the war could result in some of our customers delaying purchases from us. Although our employees in this office have the ability to work remotely and business continuity plans are in place to address any medium- or long-term disruptions that could result from the closure of this office, the office closure and general effects of employees operating in a region at war could have a negative impact on our operations. Further, a number of our employees in Israel are members of the military reserves subject to activation in response to the war. Following the terrorist attacks in Israel in October 2023, a number of our employees have been activated for military duty, and additional employees may be activated if the war in Israel continues. While we also have business continuity plans in place to address the safety of our employees and to continue product development in the event of reduced employee availability in the region during the war, it could affect the timing of projects in the short-term as work is shifted to other team members where necessary. Results of Operations In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we changed the classification of our product categories to more closely align with the strategic focus of the Company. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period revenue presentation to conform to the current period revenue presentation. Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended September 2023 2022 $ Change % Change Enterprise and Automotive product applications $ 154.8 $ 294.5 $ (139.7 ) (47.4 %) Core IoT product applications 38.5 113.4 (74.9 ) (66.0 %) Mobile product applications 44.4 40.2 4.2 10.4 % Net revenue 237.7 448.1 (210.4 ) (47.0 %) Gross margin 107.1 255.7 (148.6 ) (58.1 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 86.5 89.5 (3.0 ) (3.4 %) Selling, general, and administrative 42.3 44.7 (2.4 ) (5.4 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 5.5 9.5 (4.0 ) (42.1 %) Restructuring costs 8.0 — 8.0 100% Operating (loss) income (35.2 ) 112.0 (147.2 ) (131.4 %) Interest and other expense, net (5.4 ) (8.3 ) 2.9 34.9 % (Loss) income before provision for income taxes (40.6 ) 103.7 (144.3 ) (139.2 %) Provision for income taxes 15.0 39.1 (24.1 ) (61.6 %) Net (loss) income $ (55.6 ) $ 64.6 $ (120.2 ) (186.1 %) 27 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of operations presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point September Increase/ 2023 2022 (Decrease) Enterprise and Automotive product applications 65.1 % 65.7 % (0.6 %) Core IoT product applications 16.2 % 25.3 % (9.1 %) Mobile product applications 18.7 % 9.0 % 9.7 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 45.1 % 57.1 % (12.0 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 36.4 % 20.0 % 16.4 % Selling, general, and administrative 17.8 % 10.0 % 7.8 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.3 % 2.1 % 0.2 % Restructuring costs 3.4 % 0.0 % 3.4 % Operating (loss) income (14.8 %) 25.0 % (39.8 %) Interest and other expense, net (2.3 %) (1.9 %) (0.4 %) (Loss) income before provision for income taxes (17.1 %) 23.1 % (40.2 %) Provision for income taxes 6.3 % 8.7 % (2.4 %) Net (loss) income (23.4 %) 14.4 % (37.8 %) Net Revenue Net revenue was $237.7 million for the three months ended September 2023, compared with $448.1 million for the three months ended September 2022, a decrease of $210.4 million, or 47.0%. Of this net revenue, $154.8 million, or 65.1%, was from Enterprise and Automotive product applications, $44.4 million, or 18.7%, was from Mobile product applications, and $38.5 million, or 16.2%, was from Core IoT product applications. Revenue decreased in most of our product applications for the three months ended September 2023. Net revenue from Enterprise and Automotive product applications decreased as a result of lower average selling prices (which decreased 16.2%) due to product sales mix and a decrease in units sold (which decreased 37.3%). The decrease in revenue from Enterprise and Automotive product applications was partially offset by $27.0 million in revenue from a license of certain of our IP, or the IP license. Net revenue from Mobile product applications increased due to an increase in units sold (which increased 131.6%), as demand increased for our products in the mobile market, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 52.3%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Core IoT product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 70.7%) related to certain end customers' decline in demand and desire to reduce their inventory holdings, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 15.7%) due to our product sales mix. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45.1%, or $107.1 million, for the three months ended September 2023, compared with 57.1%, or $255.7 million, for the three months ended September 2022. The net 1,200 basis point decrease in gross margin for the three months ended September 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the excess obsolescence reserve during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and an overall decline in average sales prices across many of our product applications, partially offset by revenue from the IP license. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. Under most circumstances, revenue from license-based arrangements are accretive to our gross margin. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $3.0 million to $86.5 million for the three months ended September 2023, compared with $89.5 million for the three months ended September 2022. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a $3.4 million decrease in variable compensation costs and a $2.5 million decrease in amortization of prepaid development costs that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2023, partially offset by an increase in product development spend of $2.0 million and the reflection of one additional week in the current period compared to the same period a year ago. 28 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $2.4 million to $42.3 million for the three months ended September 2023, compared with $44.7 million for the three months ended September 2022. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $1.7 million decrease in variable compensation and a $1.4 million favorable impact from exchange rates on foreign currencies, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in professional services. Acquired Intangibles Amortization . Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 8. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net, primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net, decreased by $2.9 million to $5.4 million for the three months ended September 2023, as compared to $8.3 million for the three months ended September 2022. Interest expense on the $600 million incremental Term Loan Facility increased by $4.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, as the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility increased by 338 basis points period-over-period. The interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the Term Loan Facility for the three months ended September 2023 and 2022 were $11.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million in interest income compared to the same period a year ago and is due to the rise in interest rates period-over-period. Provision for Income Taxes . We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. See “Note 14. Income Taxes” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $801.3 million as of September 2023, compared with $924.7 million as of June 2023, representing a decrease of $123.4 million. The decrease is primarily related to a prepayment of intangible assets of $130.0 million paid to Broadcom. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of September 2023, $765.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate substantially all of these funds without impacting our provision for income taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Operating activities during the three months ended September 2023 generated $45.4 million compared with $78.5 million net cash generated during the three months ended September 2022. For the three months ended September 2023, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $75.2 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $25.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $53.6 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily related to a decrease in sales and payment in advance from some of our customers, a $6.8 million decrease in inventories as we continue our efforts to control inventory spend while turning over the inventories we accumulated during the first half of fiscal 2023 and a $22.0 million decrease in accrued compensation primarily related to payment of our annual bonus in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by a $16.7 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made to our vendors. During the three months ended September 2023, our days sales outstanding was 42 days compared to 57 days at the same period a year ago. Our annual inventory turns decreased from four to three over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 2023 was $150.1 million compared with cash provided by investing activities of $2.3 million during the three months ended September 2022. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 2023 consisted of $130.0 million paid to Broadcom as a prepayment to acquire developed technologies and to extend the exclusivity for certain products for an additional three-year period, $16.6 million to purchase short-term investments and $6.7 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $3.2 million in proceeds from the maturities of our short-term investments. 29 Cash Flows from Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 2023 was $18.1 million compared with $35.0 million used by financing activities for the three months ended September 2022. Net cash used by financing activities for the three months ended September 2023 consisted of $25.3 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for share-based awards, partially offset by $8.5 million proceeds from issuance of shares. Common Stock Repurchase Program . As of April 2023, our board had cumulatively authorized $2.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases, are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through September 2023, we purchased, net of issuances for settlement of our convertible notes, 30,116,439 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $878.0 million. During the three months ended September 2023, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock. As of September 2023, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $893.9 million. Senior Notes. In March 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes requires bi-annual interest only payments in June and December of each year. For the three months ended September 2023, we did not pay any interest on the Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility . On March 16, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment, and on July 28, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement, dated March 11, 2021. The Second Amendment replaces the LIBOR-based interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement with SOFR-based interest rate . The Third Amendment provides that the consolidated interest coverage ratio financial covenant only applies if, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, our aggregate cash and cash equivalents balance is less than $450 million. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 2023, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Term Loan Facility . In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. For three months ended September 2023, we repaid $3.0 million of the principal outstanding on the Term Loan Facility. See “Note 12. Debt” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our outstanding debt obligations. $100 Million Shelf Registration . We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs . We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including small tuck-in acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently required to meet our United States working capital and other cash requirements, but should we repatriate a portion of these earnings, we may be required to pay certain previously accrued state and foreign taxes, which would impact our cash flows. 30 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 2023 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,313.5 $ 41.7 $ 133.8 $ 131.9 $ 1,006.1 Leases 59.9 8.3 18.6 13.0 20.0 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 153.1 71.0 82.1 — — Total $ 1,526.5 $ 121.0 $ 234.5 $ 144.9 $ 1,026.1 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $39.3 million. As of September 2023, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 31 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Except as described below, as of September 30, 2023, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2023. Interest Rate Risk on Debt With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan Facility. See “Note 12. Debt” for further information. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates and the exposures that arise during the period. As an example, a hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1% or 100 basis points, the quarterly interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.5 million based on the outstanding balance of our Term Loan as of September 2023. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Although many of the restrictions and containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been lifted or scaled back, some of our employees continue to work from home, or on a hybrid basis. Established business continuity plans remain in place in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of September 30, 2023, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 32 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this report before you decide to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations could adversely impact our business. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, you should not consider the following discussion to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Risks Related to Our Markets and Customers We currently depend on our solutions for the Core IoT, Enterprise and Automotive and Mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We currently depend on our solutions for the Core IoT, Enterprise and Automotive and Mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of our products into any of these markets would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in any of these markets, or a slowdown of growth in any of these markets because of changes in customer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer. A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to two customers accounted for 29% of our net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we had five OEM customers that integrated our products into their products representing approximately 40% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, and business. We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult. We face risks related to recessions, inflation, stagflation and other macroeconomic conditions Customer demand for our products may be impacted by weak macroeconomic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recessionary or lower-growth environments, rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions or reduce their use of our services. In addition, these economic conditions could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges from our manufacturing partners if we need to slow production to reduce inventory levels. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession, our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges, and as a result they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customer demands or collect revenue or otherwise harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our manufacturing 33 partners, customers, suppliers and creditors and might prevent us from accessing preferred sources of liquidity, and causing our borrowing costs to potentially increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions, conditions in the semiconductor industry, or conditions in our customer end markets continue to deteriorate or experience a sustained period of weakness or slower growth, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to risk from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components and supplies, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our manufacturing partners or suppliers to manufacture our end products. These components and supplies have, from time-to-time, become restricted. Additionally, general market factors and conditions have in the past, and may in the future, affect pricing of such components and supplies (such as inflation or supply chain constraints). See also, “Our gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or for other reasons.” We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results. The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, production overcapacity, and increased inventory and credit risk. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy. We cannot assure you that our product solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets. Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets. Various target markets for our product solutions, such as Core IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products. Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future. If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers’ products that utilize our solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline. We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our solutions. Instead, we design various solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers’ products that incorporate our solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales could decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our solutions. We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers and expand our relationships with OEMs in new markets. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide 34 innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue. In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities in the markets in which we operate, particularly in the Core IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets. Our gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or other reasons. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In addition, our more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production expenses. Therefore, over time, we may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins. Our financial results could suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by other cost reductions through efficiencies, introduction of higher margin products and other means. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer certain price concessions to certain customers, which could cause our average selling prices and gross margins to decline. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or by our competitors and other factors. We expect to continue to have to reduce prices of existing products in the future. Moreover, because of the wide price differences across the markets we serve, the mix and types of performance capabilities of our products sold may affect the average selling prices of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin. We may enter new markets in which a significant amount of competition exists, and this may require us to sell our products with lower gross margins than we earn in our established businesses. If we are successful in growing revenue in these markets, our overall gross margin may decline. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result may harm our financial results. Additionally, because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly, testing or packaging facilities, we are not able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase, which could also reduce our gross margins. Our gross margin could also be impacted, for example, by the following factors: increased costs (including increased costs caused by tariffs, inflation, higher interest rates, or supply chain constraints); loss of cost savings if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either our manufacturers partners or our suppliers deteriorates; excess inventory, or inventory holding and obsolescence charges. In addition, we are subject to risks from fluctuating market prices of certain components, which are incorporated into our products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our products. Supplies of these components may from time-to-time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions such as inflation or supply chain constraints have in the past affected and may in the future affect pricing of such commodities. Any increase in the price of components used in our products will adversely affect our gross margins. We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Some of our customers have, and others may in the future, cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. In addition, customers who have purchase commitments may not honor those commitments. Due to their inability to predict demand or other reasons during our fiscal 2024, some of our customers have accumulated excess inventories and, as a consequence, they either have deferred or they may defer future purchases of our products. We cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. We place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. For example, our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by the delays inherent in our customer’s 35 product development processes, which may include extensive qualification and testing of components included in their products, including ours. In many cases, they design their products to use components from multiple suppliers. This creates the risk that our customers may decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our semiconductor solutions prior to completion, which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand. In addition, while many of our customers are subject to purchase orders or other agreements that do not allow for cancellation, there can be no assurance that these customers will honor these contract terms and cancellation of these orders may adversely affect our business operations and demand forecast which is the basis for us to have products made. Our products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, which creates supply chain cross-dependencies. Due to cross dependencies, supply chain disruptions have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact the demand for our products. We have a limited ability to predict the timing of a supply chain correction. If we cannot predict future customer demand or supply chain disruptions, then we may hold excess or obsolete inventory. Moreover, significant supply chain disruption may negatively impact the timing of our product shipments and revenue shipment linearity, which may impact and extend our cash conversion cycle. In addition, the market share of our customers could be adversely impacted on a long-term basis due to any continued supply chain disruption, which could negatively affect our results of operations. If we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. The risk of obsolescence and/or excess inventory is heightened for semiconductor solutions due to the rapidly changing market for these types of products. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders, or the return of previously sold products, could materially and adversely affect our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations. Risks Related to Our Supply Chain We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results. We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in Asia. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. If end customer demand declines, these long-term capacity agreements could result in significant write-downs of inventory. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to enable us to meet our customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results. 36 Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue. Risks Related to Product Development We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue. We provide solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of solutions for our OEMs’ products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer’s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer’s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results. We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue. We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the markets in which we operate, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the markets in which we operate, and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins. Some of our competitors have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies. If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer. We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we may be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential solutions. Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products. 37 Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results. We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner. Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following: Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth. Conditions in Israel may materially and adversely affect our business. We have employees located in Israel. As a result, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. In October 2023, Hamas conducted several terrorist attacks in Israel resulting in ongoing war across the country, forcing the closure of our offices in Israel for several days. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability involving Israel or other countries in the region could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. Although the Israeli Government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot ensure stockholders that this coverage will be maintained or will be adequate in the event we submit a claim. Our operations could also be disrupted by the absence for significant periods of one or more key employees or a significant number of other employees because of military service. Some of our employees in Israel are obliged to perform military reserve duty, and in certain emergency circumstances, employees may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. In response to the terrorist attacks in October 2023, a number of our employees in Israel have been activated for military duty and additional employees may be activated if the war in Israel continues. While we have business continuity plans in place to address the safety of our employees and to continue product development in the event of reduced employee availability in the region during the war, any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue. We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. We handle product quality matters sustainably by working on a one-on-one basis with our customers. We have never formally recalled a product or had a mass defect that affected an entire product line. Nevertheless, manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts. We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results. From time-to-time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available 38 to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Risks Related to International Sales and Operations Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export, and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier, or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the U.S. and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China’s overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue, and operating results. International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results. Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in Taiwan, China, and Korea by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.K. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following: 39 If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Risks Related to Our Employees We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel. Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the U.S., could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan. If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in 40 China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the U.S. We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products. We may pursue, and from time-to-time defend, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third-party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third-party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology. In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms. Any breach or violation of the terms and conditions specified in these license agreements could have significant adverse consequences on our operations and financial performance and may result in legal action, monetary penalties, or the termination of the license, which would impact our ability to offer certain products or services . If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third-party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Risks Related to Acquisitions Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating 41 results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses. We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following: We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business. Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth. We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets. We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company. In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant Systems, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the “Conexant Site”) and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state, and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 42 Risks Factors Related to Our Indebtedness Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, our 4.000% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time-to-time. On March 11, 2021, we completed the offering of the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, with a corresponding amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, or as amended and supplemented, the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Senior Notes include a mandatory semi-annual payment of a 4.000% coupon. We are permitted under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Senior Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. The covenants in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility. The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; and (x) engage in a new line of business. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. 43 General Risk Factors If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer. The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to: In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the Core IoT market, the Enterprise and Automotive applications market, and the Mobile product applications market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design, or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks. We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, ransomware, and other attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows. We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. 44 We collect, use, and store personally identifiable information, or PII, as part of our business and operations. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of PII. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. The theft, loss or misuse of PII collected, used, stored or transferred by us, our any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and discourage a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with “interested stockholders.” Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third-party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third-party’s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies’ operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance. 45 IT EM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities From April 2005 through April 2023, our Board of Directors cumulatively authorized the repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which will expire at the end of July 2025. As of September 2023, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $893.9 million. During the three months ended September 2023, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION Insider Trading Arrangements During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) adopted , terminated or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), except as described below: On July 20, 2023 , Dean Butler , our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer , terminated his 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K) intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1 (c) originally adopted on August 24, 2022, for the sale of up to 14,659 shares of the Company’s common stock until August 24, 2023, of which 1,443 shares remain unsold at the date his 10b5-1 arrangement was terminated. 46 IT EM 6.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2023 and 2022 are 52-week periods ending June 24, 2023 and June 25, 2022, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week periods ended March 25, 2023 and March 26, 2022, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed our acquisition of certain developed technology intangible assets from a subsidiary of Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom. The acquisition of the assets did not constitute a business and, accordingly, we have accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of an asset in accordance with the applicable guidance. Refer to “Note 4. Business Combination and Asset Acquisition” for further discussion of the transaction. On October 25, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza Visual Sense Ltd., or Emza. Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Emza for the period from the date of the closing of the acquisition through the second quarter of fiscal 2023. We have applied the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations to account for this transaction. Refer to “Note 4. Business Combination and Asset Acquisition” for further discussion of the transaction. Accounting Pronouncement Issued But Not Yet Adopted In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. Effective March 16, 2023, we transitioned our credit and loan agreements from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and impact, if any, of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities” which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination by providing consistent recognition guidance. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period, for any period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. However, adoption in an interim period other than the first fiscal quarter requires an entity to apply the new guidance to all prior business combinations that have occurred since the beginning of the annual period in which the new guidance is adopted. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal 2024 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 9 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 2. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Most of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Rights to our intellectual property, or IP, are either sold or licensed to customers. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occurs, or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. To date, there have been no material credit loss charges recorded on accounts receivable. As of March 2023, and June 2022, contract assets recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets were $ 1.2 million for each period. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 7.2 million and $ 39.6 million, respectively, as of March 2023, and $ 27.3 million and $ 61.3 million, respectively, as of June 2022. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 10 Balance Sheet Components. During the three and nine months ended March 2023, we recognized $ 18.8 million and $ 21.6 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of such fiscal year. During the three and nine months ended March 2022, we recognized $ 0.2 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of such fiscal year. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and product category is presented in Note 15. Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 10.4 $ 64.9 $ 97.0 $ 174.6 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.4 39.5 39.7 38.8 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 0.5 1.2 0.6 1.9 Shares, diluted 39.9 40.7 40.3 40.7 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.26 $ 1.64 $ 2.44 $ 4.50 Diluted $ 0.26 $ 1.59 $ 2.41 $ 4.29 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes, which were settled in August 2021. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 920,655 and 68,521 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended March 2023 and March 2022, respectively, and 665,898 and 31,430 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during nine months ended March 2023 and March 2022 , respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Business Combination and Asset Acquisition Asset Acquisition 10 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain developed technology intangible assets from Broadcom for an aggregate consideration of $ 30.0 million, which was paid in cash in the previous fiscal year. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the total purchase consideration was allocated to intangible assets, which are being amortized over its estimated useful life of six years. Business Combination On October 25, 2022 , we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza , a developer of ultra-low-power artificial intelligence visual sensing solutions , for total purchase consideration of $ 15.8 million. The purchase price was attributed to $ 0.3 million cash acquired, $ 8.0 million of intangible assets, $ 9.8 million of goodwill and $ 2.3 million net liabilities assumed. We will continue to evaluate certain assets, liabilities and tax estimates over the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Emza is not deductible for income tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition has not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 5 . Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): March June 2023 2022 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 75.9 $ 92.2 Finished goods 71.9 77.5 $ 147.8 $ 169.7 Inventories are recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis. We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 6 .

Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets, and the fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. At March 2023 and June 2022, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions): March 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (1) Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 395.2 $ - $ - $ 395.2 Certificates of deposit - 50.6 - 50.6 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit - 0.9 - 0.9 Corporate debt securities - 31.0 - 31.0 Municipal bonds - 4.0 - 4.0 Total assets $ 395.2 $ 86.5 $ - $ 481.7 12 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (1) Excludes $ 452.2 million in cash held in our bank accounts as of March 2023 .

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility, as defined in Note 12. Debt. The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility was determined based on the trading price of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility as of the last day of trading for the period.

Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal 2034 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years . For the nine months ended March 2023 and March 2022, we recorded approximately $ 9.1 million in each period of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial. As of March 2023 and June 2022, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): March June 2023 2022 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 51.2 $ 61.2 Operating lease liabilities $ 9.4 $ 7.6 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 44.0 51.5 Total operating lease liabilities $ 53.4 $ 59.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases, including from acquisitions, is as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 2023 2022 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 7.0 $ 9.1 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets $ 7.2 $ 39.4 14 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) As of March 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term is 7.5 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 5.1 % .

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. 15 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not, and will not, infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. While we currently believe that resolving claims against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. 12. Debt Senior Notes On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. 16 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense through the maturity date . The total interest expense and amortization of the debt issuance costs recorded on the Senior Notes during the three and nine months ended March 2023 was $ 4.1 million and $ 12.5 million, respectively . Revolving Credit Facility On March 16, 2023, we entered into a Second Amendment, or the Second Amendment, to our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended by the Second Amendment, or the “Credit Agreement,"" with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, dated March 11, 2021. The Second Amendment replaces the LIBOR-based interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement with a SOFR-based interest rate. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 2023 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Amended Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement bears interest, at our election, of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the Second Amendment, plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or Adjusted Term SOFR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for Adjusted Term SOFR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the Company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of March 2023 , we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan 17 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Effective on our next interest rate reset date, June 5, 2023, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the SOFR, plus 2.25 %, or at the Base Rate plus 1.25 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to an Adjusted Term SOFR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Prime Rate and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense and amortization of the debt issuance costs recorded on the Term Loan Facility during the three and nine months ended March 2023 was $ 11.3 million and $ 26.2 million, respectively. Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net, on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. 13. Share-Based Compensation Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated, and t he cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders is 5,288,000 as of October 25, 2022. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the 18 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. No new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan.

Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $ 16.8 million and $ 73.3 million for the three and nine months ended March 2023, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 2023 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. The provision for income taxes of $ 24.4 million and $ 32.3 million for the three and nine months ended March 2022, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 2022, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. 21 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 24.7 million during the nine months ended March 2023, to $ 54.5 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 2023 were $ 2.7 million; this balance increased by $ 0.2 million compared to June 2022. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2016 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 15. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to distributors and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2023 2022 2023 2022 China $ 152.7 $ 171.2 $ 398.9 $ 448.4 Taiwan 68.8 140.1 334.7 387.3 Japan 69.0 127.9 266.1 339.0 Other 29.7 17.4 98.6 50.6 South Korea 6.2 8.6 23.3 27.5 United States 0.2 4.9 6.2 10.5 $ 326.6 $ 470.1 $ 1,127.8 $ 1,263.3 Net revenue from our customers for each product category was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2023 2022 2023 2022 IoT product applications $ 231.7 $ 301.6 $ 813.7 $ 768.8 PC product applications 53.3 90.1 175.0 261.4 Mobile product applications 41.6 78.4 139.1 233.1 $ 326.6 $ 470.1 $ 1,127.8 $ 1,263.3 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2023 2022 2023 2022 Customer A * 14 % * 13 % Customer B * 14 % 10 % 13 % Customer C 18 % * * * ____________________ * Less than 10 % 22 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: March June 2023 2022 Customer A 12 % 17 % Customer B 13 % 15 % Customer C 10 % * ____________________ * Less than 10 % 16. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of unrealized gains or losses on our available-for-sale securities. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 17. Restructuring Activities In prior years, we initiated various strategic restructuring actions primarily intended to reduce costs, gain synergies from our recent acquisitions and align our business in response to market conditions. Restructuring charges were mainly comprised of severance and other one-time termination benefits and were complete by the end of fiscal 2022. We recorded restructuring related charges of $ 11.3 million and $ 17.8 million for the three and nine months ended March 2022 , respectively. We did no t incur any restructuring related charges during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 23 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 25, 2023 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to the following: our dependence on our solutions for the IoT product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for IoT product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 Many of the restrictions and other containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back. We have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 pandemic and our business has not been severely impacted. We will continue to evaluate the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond in the event of a reemergence of the pandemic. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Nearly all of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occurs, or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely 24 with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. In the past, when supply constraints and capacity shortages have impacted the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and the provision for excess and obsolete inventories to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of developed technology, customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 17. Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes (as defined herein), Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Acquisitions Broadcom In February 2023, we completed our acquisition of certain developed technology intangible assets from Broadcom for an aggregate consideration of $30.0 million, which was paid in cash in the previous fiscal year. Emza On October 25, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza for total purchase consideration of $15.8 million, which was paid in cash. The results of Emza are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from October 25, 2022. DSP Group, Inc. In fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the equity of DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, for $22.00 per share of common stock, a total purchase consideration of $543.3 million. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and Term Loan Facility under our existing senior credit facility. The results of DSPG are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from December 3, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended March 2023, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. 25 Trends and Uncertainties Current Economic Conditions The frequency and amplitude in which central banks raise interest rates has subsided relative to the second half of calendar year 2022, but the impact has had a material effect on many sectors of the economy leading to broad-based workforce reductions, a slowing or deferral of investment in information technology spending, and increased concern of a global recession. We believe the threat of global recession is the primary driver for the slowdown in orders from our customer base. During the quarter, we experienced a broad reduction in demand in most of our product applications as many customers and channel partners continue to consume their accumulation of inventories, combined with customer requests to delay orders. We continue to believe that the demand slowdown is temporary, but the rebound in demand may push into late calendar 2023, or potentially beyond 2023. In addition, although we currently do not believe inflation in the costs of goods and services will have a material impact on our results of operations, it is possible that rising inflation could increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income. Further, rising interest rates have increased our borrowing costs on our variable rate Term Loan Facility, which will continue to drive an increase in interest costs in future accounting periods and potentially limit our borrowing capacity if a future acquisition opportunity requiring financing presents itself. Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March Nine Months Ended March 2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2023 2022 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 231.7 $ 301.6 $ (69.9 ) (23.2 %) $ 813.7 $ 768.8 $ 44.9 5.8 % PC product applications 53.3 90.1 (36.8 ) (40.8 %) 175.0 261.4 (86.4 ) (33.1 %) Mobile product applications 41.6 78.4 (36.8 ) (46.9 %) 139.1 233.1 (94.0 ) (40.3 %) Net revenue 326.6 470.1 (143.5 ) (30.5 %) 1,127.8 1,263.3 (135.5 ) (10.7 %) Gross margin 172.3 253.8 (81.5 ) (32.1 %) 614.7 677.0 (62.3 ) (9.2 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 87.9 98.2 (10.3 ) (10.5 %) 266.7 273.2 (6.5 ) (2.4 %) Selling, general, and administrative 41.7 44.2 (2.5 ) (5.7 %) 128.8 130.1 (1.3 ) (1.0 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 8.5 12.0 (3.5 ) (29.2 %) 26.9 29.6 (2.7 ) (9.1 %) Restructuring costs — 11.3 (11.3 ) (100.0 %) - 17.8 (17.8 ) (100.0 %) Operating income 34.2 88.1 (53.9 ) (61.2 %) 192.3 226.3 (34.0 ) (15.0 %) Interest and other expense, net (7.0 ) (6.7 ) (0.3 ) (4.5 %) (22.0 ) (18.3 ) (3.7 ) (20.2 %) Gain on sale and leaseback transaction — 5.4 (5.4 ) (100.0 %) - 5.4 (5.4 ) (100.0 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes — — — 0.0 % - (8.1 ) 8.1 100.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 27.2 86.8 (59.6 ) (68.7 %) 170.3 205.3 (35.0 ) (17.0 %) Provision for income taxes 16.8 24.4 (7.6 ) (31.1 %) 73.3 32.3 41.0 126.9 % Equity investment gain — 2.5 (2.5 ) (100.0 %) - 1.6 (1.6 ) (100.0 %) Net income $ 10.4 $ 64.9 $ (54.5 ) (84.0 %) $ 97.0 $ 174.6 $ (77.6 ) (44.4 %) 26 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Nine Months Ended Percentage Point March Increase/ March Increase/ 2023 2022 (Decrease) 2023 2022 (Decrease) IoT product applications 71.0 % 64.1 % 6.9 % 72.2 % 60.9 % 11.3 % PC product applications 16.3 % 19.2 % (2.9 %) 15.5 % 20.7 % (5.2 %) Mobile product applications 12.7 % 16.7 % (4.0 %) 12.3 % 18.4 % (6.1 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % (0.0 %) 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 52.8 % 54.0 % (1.2 %) 54.5 % 53.6 % 0.9 % Operating expenses: Research and development 26.9 % 20.9 % 6.0 % 23.6 % 21.6 % 2.0 % Selling, general, and administrative 12.8 % 9.4 % 3.4 % 11.4 % 10.3 % 1.1 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.6 % 2.6 % 0.0 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 0.0 % Restructuring costs 0.0 % 2.4 % (2.4 %) 0.0 % 1.4 % (1.4 %) Operating income 10.5 % 18.7 % (8.2 %) 17.1 % 17.9 % (0.8 %) Interest and other expense, net (2.1 %) (1.4 %) (0.7 %) (2.0 %) (1.4 %) (0.6 %) Gain on sale and leaseback transaction 0.0 % 1.2 % (1.2 %) 0.0 % 0.4 % (0.4 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % (0.6 %) 0.6 % Income before provision for income taxes 8.4 % 18.5 % (10.1 %) 15.1 % 16.3 % (1.2 %) Provision for income taxes 5.1 % 5.2 % (0.1 %) 6.5 % 2.6 % 3.9 % Equity investment gain 0.0 % 0.5 % (0.5 %) 0.0 % 0.1 % (0.1 %) Net income 3.3 % 13.8 % (10.5 %) 8.6 % 13.8 % (5.2 %) Net Revenue Net revenue was $326.6 million for the three months ended March 2023, compared with $470.1 million for the three months ended March 2022, a decrease of $143.5 million, or 30.5%. Of this net revenue, $231.7 million, or 71.0%, was from IoT product applications, $53.3 million, or 16.3%, was from PC product applications, and $41.6 million, or 12.7%, was from Mobile product applications. Revenue decreased in all of our product applications for the three months ended March 2023. Net revenue from IoT product applications decreased as a result of lower average selling prices (which decreased 10.0%) due to product sales mix and a decrease in units sold (which decreased 14.7%). During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, net revenue from IoT product applications included $33.5 million in revenue from a license of certain of our IP, or the IP license. Although we have recognized revenue from license-based arrangements in previous fiscal years, the amount of such revenue is generally inconsequential to our consolidated financial results. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 41.0%) related to certain end customers' decline in demand and desire to reduce their inventory holdings, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 0.2%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 21.3%) as demand broadly softened for our products in the mobile market coupled with a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 32.6%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue was $1,127.8 million for the nine months ended March 2023, compared with $1,263.3 million for the nine months ended March 2022, a decrease of $135.5 million, or 10.7%. Of this net revenue, $813.7 million, or 72.2%, was from IoT product applications, $175.0 million, or 15.5% was from PC product applications, and $139.1 million, or 12.3%, was from Mobile product applications. Revenue decreased in most of our product applications for the nine months ended March 2023. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of the revenue recognized from the IP license and an increase in units sold (which increased 12.1%), partially offset by lower average selling prices (which decreased 5.6%) due to product sales mix. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 37.3%) partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 6.7%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 39.1%) for Mobile product applications and lower average selling prices (which decreased 2.1%) due to our product sales mix. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 52.8%, or $172.3 million, for the three months ended March 2023, compared with 54.0%, or $253.8 million, for the three months ended March 2022. The net 120 basis point decrease in gross margin for the three months ended March 2023, was primarily due to the decrease in units sold and an overall decline in average sales prices across many of our product applications, partially offset by revenue from the IP license. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 54.5% or $614.7 million, for the nine months ended March 2023, compared with 53.6%, or $677.0 million, for the nine months ended March 2022. The net 90 basis point increase in gross margin for the nine months ended March 2023, was due to a combination of revenue from the IP license, partially offset by a decrease in units sold and an overall decline in average sales prices across many of our product applications. 27 Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. Revenue from license-based arrangements are accretive to our gross margin. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $10.3 million to $87.9 million for the three months ended March 2023, compared with $98.2 million for the three months ended March 2022. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a $5.9 million decrease in variable compensation costs and a $5.9 million decrease in share-based compensation costs related to our phantom stock awards. The final vesting of our phantom stock awards occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and there are no phantom stock awards outstanding. As a result, no compensation cost thereon was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with $5.9 million during the same period a year ago. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in payroll related costs of $2.2 million. Research and development expenses decreased $6.5 million to $266.7 million for the nine months ended March 2023, compared with $273.2 million for the nine months ended March 2022. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $13.9 million decrease in variable compensation costs and a $17.9 million decrease in share-based compensation costs primarily related to our phantom stock awards. The final vesting of our phantom stock awards occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and there are no phantom stock awards outstanding. Total compensation costs associated with our phantom stock awards for the nine months ended March 2023 and March 2022 were $0.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in payroll related costs of $14.4 million, an increase of $2.5 million in new product development activities, a $2.4 million increase in software license and maintenance fees, and a $2.9 million increase in charges associated with capitalized equipment. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $2.5 million to $41.7 million for the three months ended March 2023, compared with $44.2 million for the three months ended March 2022. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $3.0 million decrease in variable compensation, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in payroll related costs and a net increase of $1.6 million in share-based compensation. The net increase in share-based compensation consisted of a $2.9 million increase associated with our equity-settled awards, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in share-based compensation associated with our phantom stock awards. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $1.3 million to $128.8 million for the nine months ended March 2023, compared with $130.1 million for the nine months ended March 2022. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $7.4 million decrease in variable compensation, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in payroll related costs, and a net $4.2 million increase in share-based compensation costs. The net increase in share-based compensation consisted of a $9.4 million increase associated with our equity-settled awards, partially offset by a $5.3 million decrease in share-based compensation associated with our phantom stock awards. Acquired Intangibles Amortization . Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 8. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net, primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net, increased by $0.3 million to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 2023, as compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 2022. Interest expense on the $600 million incremental Term Loan Facility increased by $6.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago, as the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility increased by 465 basis points period-over-period. The interest expense on the Term Loan Facility for the three months ended March 2023 and March 2022 was $11.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase of $8.1 million in interest income compared to the same period a year ago and is due to the rise in interest rates period-over-period. Interest and other expense, net, increased $3.7 million to $22.0 million for the nine months ended March 2023, as compared to $18.3 million for the nine months ended March 2022. Interest expense on the $600 million incremental Term Loan Facility increased by $20.3 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago, as the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility increased by 465 basis points period-over-period. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility was funded in December 2021 and only included a partial amount of interest expense thereon during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022. The interest expense on the Term Loan Facility for the nine months ended March 2023 and March 2022 was $26.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase of $16.9 million in interest income compared to the same period a year ago and is due to the rise in interest rates period-over-period. 28 Provision for Income Taxes . We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $16.8 million and $73.3 million for the three and nine months ended March 2023, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 2023, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. The provision for income taxes of $24.4 million and $32.3 million for the three and nine months ended March 2022, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 2022, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $898.0 million as of March 2023, compared with $824.0 million as of June 2022, representing an increase of $74.0 million. The increase primarily reflected $16.3 million in proceeds from maturities of our short-term investments and $237.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $52.2 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for stock-based awards, $15.5 million net cash paid to acquire Emza, $29.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment and $100.1 million for repurchases of our common stock. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of March 2023, $797.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate substantially all of these funds without impacting our provision for income taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Operating activities during the nine months ended March 2023 generated $237.0 million compared with $308.4 million net cash generated during the nine months ended March 2022. For the nine months ended March 2023, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $207.2 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $67.2 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $106.7 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $17.2 million decrease in inventories, a $80.7 million decrease in accounts payable, a $47.7 million decrease in accrued compensation and a net decrease of $67.3 in income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities. During the nine months ended March 2023, our days sales outstanding was 60 days compared to 57 days at the same period a year ago. Our annual inventory turns decreased from five to four over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended March 2023 was $28.1 million compared with $469.4 million during the nine months ended March 2022. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended March 2023 consisted of $15.5 net cash paid to acquire Emza and $29.0 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $16.3 million in proceeds from the maturities of our short-term investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 2023 was $134.2 million compared with $16.9 million provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 2022. Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended March 2023 consisted of $52.2 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for share-based awards and $100.1 million used to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by $17.6 million proceeds from issuance of shares. Common Stock Repurchase Program . As of April 2023, our board had cumulatively authorized $2.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases, are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through March 2023, we purchased, net of issuances for settlement of our convertible notes, 29,117,497 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of 29 $794.6 million. During the nine months ended March 2023, we repurchased 992,876 shares of our common stock. As of March 2023, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $477.3 million. Senior Notes. In March 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes requires bi-annual interest only payments. For the nine months ended March 2023, we paid interest expense of $8.0 million on the Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility . On March 16, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment to our Credit Agreement, dated March 11, 2021. The Second Amendment replaces the LIBOR-based interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement with SOFR-based interest rate . The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 2023, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Term Loan Facility . In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. For nine months ended March 2023, we repaid $4.5 million of the principal outstanding on the Term Loan Facility. See “Note 12. Debt” in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our outstanding debt obligations. $100 Million Shelf Registration . We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs . We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including small tuck-in acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the continuing or worsening impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently required to meet our United States working capital and other cash requirements, but should we repatriate a portion of these earnings, we may be required to pay certain previously accrued state and foreign taxes, which would impact our cash flows. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 2023 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,348.7 $ 12.5 $ 130.7 $ 128.9 $ 1,076.6 Leases 64.7 1.9 21.2 15.7 25.9 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 160.8 25.1 116.7 19.0 — Total $ 1,574.2 $ 39.5 $ 268.6 $ 163.6 $ 1,102.5 30 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $54.5 million. As of March 2023, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 31 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Except as described below, as of March 25, 2023, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. Interest Rate Risk on Debt With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan Facility. See “Note 12. Debt” for further information. On March 16, 2023, the interest rate on our credit facilities was converted from LIBOR to SOFR, effective on our next interest rate reset date, June 5, 2023. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates and the exposures that arise during the period. As an example, a hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1% or 100 basis points, the quarterly interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.5 million based on the outstanding balance of our Term Loan as of March 2023. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Although many of the restrictions and containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been lifted or scaled back, some of our employees continue to work from home, or on a hybrid basis. Established business continuity plans remain in place in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of March 25, 2023, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended March 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 32 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. 33 IT EM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities As of March 2023, our Board of Directors had cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2025. As of March 2023, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $477.3 million. During the three months ended March 2023, repurchases under our common stock repurchase program were as follows: Total Maximum Dollar Number of Shares Value of Shares Average Purchased that May Be Total Price as Part of Purchased Number Paid Publicly in the Future of Shares per Announced Under the Period Purchased Share Program Program December 25, 2022 - January 21, 2023 165,114 $ 100.10 165,114 $ 486,333,385 January 22, 2023 - February 18, 2023 74,585 120.70 74,585 477,331,332 February 19, 2023 - March 25, 2023 — — — 477,331,332 Total 239,699 34 IT EM 6.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2023 and 2022 are 52-week periods ending June 24, 2023 and June 25, 2022, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week periods ended December 24, 2022, and December 25, 2021, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Business Combinations On October 25, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza Visual Sense Ltd., or Emza. Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Emza for the period from the date of the closing of the acquisition through the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. We have applied the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations to account for this transaction. Refer to “Note 4. Acquisitions” for further discussion of the transaction. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement Pending Adoption In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities” which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination by providing consistent recognition guidance. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period, for any period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. However, adoption in an interim period other than the first fiscal quarter requires an entity to apply the new guidance to all prior business combinations that have occurred since the beginning of the annual period in which the new guidance is adopted. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and impact, if any, of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 9 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 1.3 million and $ 1.2 million in contract assets recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 2022 and June 2022, respectively. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 27.3 million and $ 40.8 million, respectively, as of December 2022 and $ 27.3 million and $ 61.3 million, respectively, as of June 2022. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 10 Balance Sheet Components. During the six months ended December 2022 and December 2021, we recognized $ 2.8 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and product category is presented in Note 15 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 22.0 $ 69.5 $ 86.6 $ 109.7 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.8 39.4 39.8 38.5 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 0.4 1.3 0.7 2.2 Shares, diluted 40.2 40.7 40.5 40.7 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.55 $ 1.76 $ 2.18 $ 2.85 Diluted $ 0.55 $ 1.71 $ 2.14 $ 2.70 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes, which were settled in August 2021. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 1,092,428 and 12,987 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended December 2022 and December 2021, respectively, and 640,047 and 10,209 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during six months ended December 2022 and December 2021 , respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Acquisitions On October 25, 2022 , we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza , a developer of ultra-low-power artificial intelligence visual sensing solutions , for total purchase consideration of $ 15.8 million. The purchase price was attributed to $ 0.3 million cash acquired, $ 8.0 million of intangible assets, $ 9.8 million of goodwill and $ 2.3 10 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) million net liabilities assumed. We will continue to evaluate certain assets, liabilities and tax estimates over the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Emza is not deductible for income tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition has not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 5 . Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): December June 2022 2022 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 84.1 $ 92.2 Finished goods 93.4 77.5 $ 177.5 $ 169.7 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 6 . Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by category at December 2022 and June 2022 (in millions): December 2022 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Cash $ 321.4 $ - $ 321.4 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 440.0 - 440.0 Certificates of deposit 57.4 - 57.4 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 818.8 $ - $ 818.8 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 1.1 $ - $ 1.1 Corporate debt securities 35.8 ( 1.6 ) 34.2 Municipal bonds 4.9 ( 0.1 ) 4.8 Total short-term investments $ 41.8 $ ( 1.7 ) $ 40.1 June 2022 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Cash $ 811.9 $ - $ 811.9 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 12.1 - 12.1 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 824.0 $ - $ 824.0 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 2.4 $ - $ 2.4 Corporate debt securities 43.7 ( 1.9 ) 41.8 Municipal bonds 7.9 ( 0.1 ) 7.8 Total short-term investments $ 54.0 $ ( 2.0 ) $ 52.0 11 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The following table classifies our short-term investments by contractual maturities (in millions): December 2022 June 2022 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 18.5 $ 18.2 $ 21.0 $ 20.4 Due between 1 year to 5 years 23.3 21.9 33.0 31.6 $ 41.8 $ 40.1 $ 54.0 $ 52.0 7 . Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets, and the fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. At December 2022 and June 2022, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions): December 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (1) Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 440.0 $ - $ - $ 440.0 Certificates of deposit - 57.4 - 57.4 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit - 1.1 - 1.1 Corporate debt securities - 34.2 - 34.2 Municipal bonds - 4.8 - 4.8 Total assets $ 440.0 $ 97.5 $ - $ 537.5 (1) Excludes $ 321.5 million in cash held in our bank accounts as of December 2022 .

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility, as defined in Note 12 Debt. The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility was determined based on the trading price of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility are as follows for the periods presented (in millions): December 2022 June 2022 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Senior Notes due 2029 $ 395.3 $ 339.0 $ 395.0 $ 326.9 Term Loan Facility due 2028 584.6 574.0 586.7 $ 575.0 $ 979.9 $ 913.0 $ 981.7 $ 901.9 8 .

During the three months ended December 2022 and December 2021, $ 23.3 million and $ 19.9 million, respectively, and $ 46.8 million and $ 36.8 million for the six months ended December 2022 and December 2021, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. 9 . Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2034 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years . For the six months ended December 2022 and December 2021, we recorded approximately $ 6.3 million and $ 5.7 million, respectively, of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial. As of December 2022 and June 2022, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): December June 2022 2022 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 53.0 $ 61.2 Operating lease liabilities $ 7.8 $ 7.6 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 45.3 51.5 Total operating lease liabilities $ 53.1 $ 59.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases, including from acquisitions, is as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended December 2022 2021 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 6.2 $ 5.4 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets $ 6.7 $ 17.6 As of December 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term is 7.5 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 5.1 % . Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2023 $ 2.5 2024 11.2 2025 9.8 2026 8.3 2027 7.3 Thereafter 26.0 Total future minimum operating lease payments 65.1 Less: interest ( 12.0 ) Total lease liabilities $ 53.1 14 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 10 .

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 12. Debt Senior Notes On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. 15 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense through the maturity date . The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the three and six months ended December 2022 was $ 4.0 million and $ 8.0 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. 16 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of December 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the Company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of December 2022 , we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25 % or at the base rate plus 1.50 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. 17 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Term Loan Facility during the three and six months ended December 2022 was $ 7.7 million and $ 14.2 million, respectively. Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net, on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. 13. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2022 2021 2022 2021 Cost of revenue $ 1.0 $ 1.3 $ 2.1 $ 2.3 Research and development 13.4 18.6 27.4 39.4 Selling, general, and administrative 15.6 16.7 33.1 30.5 Total $ 30.0 $ 36.6 $ 62.6 $ 72.2 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ ( 4.1 ) $ ( 11.4 ) $ ( 7.9 ) $ ( 16.7 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2022 2021 2022 2021 Cost of revenue $ — $ 0.1 $ - $ 0.1 Research and development ( 1.2 ) 8.4 0.3 20.2 Selling, general, and administrative ( 0.2 ) 1.7 0.4 4.3 Total $ ( 1.4 ) $ 10.2 $ 0.7 $ 24.6 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 18 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of October 29, 2019, no new awards may be granted under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated, and t he cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders is 5,288,000 as of October 25, 2022. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. N o new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 31,185 $ 61.51 Exercised ( 7,019 ) 81.50 Expired ( 299 ) 89.30 Balance as of December 2022 23,867 55.30 $ 0.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2022 of $ 94.15 . Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2019, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2006. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. Accordingly, any reference to RSU is intended to signify both an RSU and a DSU. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. RSU activity was as follows: Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 1,220,573 Granted 717,776 Delivered ( 484,856 ) Forfeited ( 52,122 ) Balance as of December 2022 1,401,371 $ 131.9 19 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2022 of $ 94.15 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. Of the shares delivered, 146,614 shares valued at $ 17.7 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2023, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 300 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 300 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 80th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25th and 80th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50th percentile equal to 100 % of target. The first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 300 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25th and 75th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50th percentile equal to 100 % of target. The first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. 20 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 251,974 Granted 270,342 Delivered ( 304,334 ) Balance as of December 2022 217,982 $ 20.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2022 of $ 94.15 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. Of the shares delivered, 159,379 shares valued at $ 18.5 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis by tranche. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 33.5 million as of December 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2010 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSU awards to our executive officers and other key management team members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which, generally, are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU award. Generally, PSU awards have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of performance relative to predefined performance criteria (for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2023 and prior to fiscal 2022 the performance criteria is based on non-GAAP earnings per share, for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2021 the performance criteria is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses). For our fiscal 2023 PSU awards, the potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 257,903 Awarded 265,446 Released ( 250,118 ) Forfeited ( 5,359 ) Balance as of December 2022 267,872 $ 25.2 21 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2022 of $ 94.15 .

Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. Of the shares delivered, 114,859 shares valued at $ 12.9 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 46.4 million as of December 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.1 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units to certain non-officer employees in October 2019 and there have been no subsequent phantom stock unit grants. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. The final vesting occurred on October 31, 2022, and no phantom stock units remain outstanding under this plan. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2022 176,097 Paid ( 173,436 ) Forfeited ( 2,661 ) Balance as of December 2022 - Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the three and six months ended December 2022 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 88,210 Weighted average purchase price $ 92.52 Cash received $ 9.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 1.4 14. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $ 17.4 million and $ 56.5 million for the three and six months ended December 2022, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. 22 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) The provision for income taxes of $ 2.0 million and $ 7.9 million for the three and six months ended December 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 21.4 million during the six months ended December 2022, to $ 51.2 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2022 were $ 2.7 million; this balance increased by $ 0.2 million compared to June 2022. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2016 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 15. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to OEMs and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2022 2021 2022 2021 China $ 131.7 $ 142.1 $ 246.2 $ 277.2 Taiwan 85.2 127.6 265.9 247.1 Japan 90.8 119.5 197.1 211.1 Other 32.3 16.8 68.9 33.3 South Korea 11.5 10.7 17.1 18.9 United States 1.6 3.8 6.0 5.6 $ 353.1 $ 420.5 $ 801.2 $ 793.2 Net revenue from our customers for each product category was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2022 2021 2022 2021 IoT product applications $ 239.3 $ 261.5 $ 582.0 $ 467.2 PC product applications 56.5 82.7 121.7 171.3 Mobile product applications 57.3 76.3 97.5 154.7 $ 353.1 $ 420.5 $ 801.2 $ 793.2 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2022 2021 2022 2021 Customer A 11 % 13 % 10 % 12 % Customer B * 12 % 10 % 12 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % 23 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: December June 2022 2022 Customer A 16 % 17 % Customer B 14 % 15 % 16. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of unrealized gains or losses on our available-for-sale securities. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 17. Restructuring Activities In prior years, we initiated various strategic restructuring actions primarily intended to reduce costs, gain synergies from our recent acquisitions and align our business in response to market conditions. Restructuring charges were mainly comprised of severance and other one-time termination benefits and were complete by the end of fiscal year 2022. We recorded restructuring related charges of $ 5.1 million and $ 6.5 million for the three and six months ended December 2021 , respectively. We did no t incur any restructuring related charges during the first half of fiscal year 2023. 24 ITEM 2.

Impact of COVID-19 Although many of the restrictions and other containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 and its variants continue, which may result in a variety of responses in the many geographic locations in which we do business, from no actions taken to the re-imposition of lockdowns and containment measures designed to mitigate or reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority, and a large number of our workforce has been vaccinated. Many of our employees that worked from home at the onset of COVID-19, or during subsequent lockdowns, have returned full-time or on a hybrid basis to our office environment. For some of those employees that have returned to the office, we continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread and vaccinate large portions of the population. However, if more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, we, our customers, and our suppliers could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. We will continue to evaluate the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to the ongoing pandemic. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, 25 Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. In the past, when supply constraints and capacity shortages have impacted the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and the provision for excess and obsolete inventories to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of developed technology, customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 17 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes (as defined herein), Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Acquisitions Emza On October 25, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emza for total purchase consideration of $15.8 million, which was paid in cash. The results of Emza are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from October 25, 2022. DSP Group, Inc. In fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the equity of DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, for $22.00 per share of common stock, a total purchase consideration of $543.3 million. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and Term Loan Facility under our existing senior credit facility. The results of DSPG are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from December 3, 2021. 26 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended December 2022, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. Trends and Uncertainties Current Economic Conditions As many central banks continue to raise interest rates to combat inflation, the potential for global recession also rises. This threat of global recession appears to be driving increased caution in our customer base. During the quarter, we continued to experience reduced demand in some of our product applications as certain customers and channel partners continue to consume their accumulation of inventories, combined with customer requests to delay orders. We are cautiously optimistic, and we continue to believe that the demand slowdown is temporary, but if we do slip into a global recession, the rebound in demand may take longer than we currently anticipate. In addition, although we currently do not believe inflation in the costs of goods and services will have a material impact on our results of operations, it is possible that rising inflation could increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income. Further, rising interest rates have increased our borrowing costs on our variable rate Term Loan Facility, which will continue to drive an increase in interest costs in future accounting periods and potentially limit our borrowing capacity if a future acquisition opportunity requiring financing presents itself. Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended December Six Months Ended December 2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2022 2021 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 239.3 $ 261.5 $ (22.2 ) (8.5 %) $ 582.0 $ 467.2 $ 114.8 24.6 % PC product applications 56.5 82.7 (26.2 ) (31.7 %) 121.7 171.3 (49.6 ) (29.0 %) Mobile product applications 57.3 76.3 (19.0 ) (24.9 %) 97.5 154.7 (57.2 ) (37.0 %) Net revenue 353.1 420.5 (67.4 ) (16.0 %) 801.2 793.2 8.0 1.0 % Gross margin 186.7 225.1 (38.4 ) (17.1 %) 442.4 423.2 19.2 4.5 % Operating expenses: Research and development 89.3 88.9 0.4 0.4 % 178.8 175.0 3.8 2.2 % Selling, general, and administrative 42.4 44.3 (1.9 ) (4.3 %) 87.1 85.9 1.2 1.4 % Acquired intangibles amortization 8.9 9.2 (0.3 ) (3.3 %) 18.4 17.6 0.8 4.5 % Restructuring costs — 5.1 (5.1 ) (100.0 %) - 6.5 (6.5 ) (100.0 %) Operating income 46.1 77.6 (31.5 ) (40.6 %) 158.1 138.2 19.9 14.4 % Interest and other expense, net (6.7 ) (5.7 ) (1.0 ) (17.5 %) (15.0 ) (11.6 ) (3.4 ) (29.3 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes — — — 0.0 % - (8.1 ) 8.1 100.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 39.4 71.9 (32.5 ) (45.2 %) 143.1 118.5 24.6 20.8 % Provision for income taxes 17.4 2.0 15.4 770.0 % 56.5 7.9 48.6 615.2 % Equity investment loss — 0.4 (0.4 ) (100.0 %) - 0.9 (0.9 ) (100.0 %) Net income $ 22.0 $ 69.5 $ (47.5 ) (68.3 %) $ 86.6 $ 109.7 $ (23.1 ) (21.1 %) 27 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Six Months Ended Percentage Point December Increase/ December Increase/ 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2022 2021 (Decrease) IoT product applications 67.9 % 62.2 % 5.7 % 72.6 % 58.9 % 13.7 % PC product applications 15.9 % 19.7 % (3.8 %) 15.2 % 21.6 % (6.4 %) Mobile product applications 16.2 % 18.1 % (1.9 %) 12.2 % 19.5 % (7.3 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 52.9 % 53.5 % (0.6 %) 55.2 % 53.4 % 1.8 % Operating expenses: Research and development 25.3 % 21.1 % 4.2 % 22.3 % 22.1 % 0.2 % Selling, general, and administrative 12.0 % 10.5 % 1.5 % 10.9 % 10.8 % 0.1 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.5 % 2.2 % 0.3 % 2.3 % 2.2 % 0.1 % Restructuring costs 0.0 % 1.2 % (1.2 %) 0.0 % 0.8 % (0.8 %) Operating income 13.1 % 18.5 % (5.4 %) 19.7 % 17.4 % 2.3 % Interest and other expense, net (1.9 %) (1.4 %) (0.5 %) (1.9 %) (1.5 %) (0.4 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % (1.0 %) 1.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 11.2 % 17.1 % (5.9 %) 17.9 % 14.9 % 3.0 % Provision for income taxes 4.9 % 0.5 % 4.4 % 7.1 % 1.0 % 6.1 % Equity investment loss 0.0 % 0.1 % (0.1 %) 0.0 % 0.1 % (0.1 %) Net income 6.2 % 16.5 % (10.3 %) 10.8 % 13.8 % (3.0 %) Net Revenue Net revenue was $353.1 million for the three months ended December 2022, compared with $420.5 million for three months ended December 2021, a decrease of $67.4 million, or 16.0%. Of this net revenue, $239.3 million, or 67.9%, was from IoT product applications, $56.5 million, or 15.9%, was from PC product applications, and $57.3 million, or 16.2%, was from Mobile product applications. Revenue decreased in all of our product applications for the three months ended December 2022. Net revenue from IoT product applications decreased as a result of lower average selling prices (which decreased 11.1%) due to product sales mix, partially offset by an increase in units sold (which increased 2.9%). Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 30.8%) related to certain end customers' decline in demand and desire to reduce their inventory holdings coupled with a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 1.3%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 28.3%) as demand broadly softened for our products in the mobile market, partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 4.8%). Net revenue was $801.2 million for the six months ended December 2022, compared with $793.2 million for the six months ended December 2021, an increase of $8.0 million, or 1.0%. Of this net revenue, $582.0 million, or 72.6%, was from IoT product applications, $121.7 million, or 15.2% was from PC product applications, and $97.5 million, or 12.2%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the six months ended December 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from PC and Mobile product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 29.5%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 58.4%) due to product sales mix. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 35.5%) partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 9.7%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 46.6%) for Mobile product applications and lower average selling prices (which decreased 20.8%) due to our product sales mix. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 52.9%, or $186.7 million, for the three months ended December 2022, compared with 53.5%, or $225.1 million, for the three months ended December 2021. The 60-basis point decrease in gross margin for the three months ended December 2022, was due to a decrease in average sales prices across many of our product applications. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 55.2% or $442.4 million, for the six months ended December 2022, compared with 53.4%, or $423.2 million, for the six months ended December 2021. The 180 basis point increase in gross margin for the six months ended December 2022, was due to an overall favorable product mix and an increase in average sales prices across many of our product applications. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge the provision for excess and obsolete inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. 28 Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses increased $0.4 million to $89.3 million for the three months ended December 2022, compared with $88.9 million for the three months ended December 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by an increase in payroll and other employee related costs of $6.3 million, a $2.0 million increase in new product development activities, partially offset by a $6.4 million decrease in variable compensation and a $5.2 million decrease in share-based compensation costs primarily related to a decrease in our stock price associated with cash settled phantom stock awards during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. Research and development expenses increased $3.8 million to $178.8 million for the six months ended December 2022, compared with $175.0 million for the six months ended December 2021. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $12.2 million increase in payroll related costs, a $3.6 million increase in new product development activities, a $2.9 million increase in software license and maintenance fees, partially offset by a $8.0 million decrease in variable compensation and a $12.0 million decrease in share-based compensation costs primarily related to a decrease in our stock price associated with cash settled phantom stock awards during the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $1.9 million to $42.4 million for the three months ended December 2022, compared with $44.3 million for the three months ended December 2021. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $0.6 million increase in payroll related costs, a $2.2 million loss from foreign currency remeasurement upon modification of an operating lease, partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in variable compensation and a $1.1 million decrease in share-based compensation costs primarily related to a decrease in our stock price associated with cash settled phantom stock awards during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $1.2 million to $87.1 million for the six months ended December 2022, compared with $85.9 million for the six months ended December 2021. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $2.8 million increase in payroll related costs, a $2.2 million loss from foreign currency remeasurement upon modification of an operating lease, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in variable compensation. Acquired Intangibles Amortization . Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 8 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net, primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net, increased by $1.0 million to $6.7 million for the three months ended December 2022, as compared to $5.7 million for the three months ended December 2021. The increase in interest and other expense, net, is primarily due to interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $600 million incremental Term Loan Facility executed in December 2021. The second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes a full quarter of interest expense on the $600 million Term Loan Facility whereas during the same period a year ago, the interest expense thereon only included a partial month. Additionally, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility had increased by 465 basis points by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in interest and other expense, net, was partially offset by a $5.7 million increase in interest income compared to the same period a year ago and is related to a rise in interest rates period-over-period. Interest and other expense, net, increased $3.4 million to $15.0 million for the six months ended December 2022, as compared to $11.6 million for the six months ended December 2021. The first half of fiscal 2023 includes a period of interest expense on the $600 million Term Loan Facility whereas during the same period a year ago, the interest expense thereon only included a partial month. Additionally, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility had increased by 465 basis points by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in interest and other expense, net, was partially offset by a $8.8 million increase in interest income compared to the same period a year ago and is related to a rise in interest rates period-over-period. Provision for Income Taxes . We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to 29 several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $17.4 million and $56.5 million for the three and six months ended December 2022, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 2022, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. The provision for income taxes of $2.0 million and $7.9 million for the three and six months ended December 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $818.8 million as of December 2022, compared with $824.0 million as of June 2022, representing a decrease of $5.2 million. The decrease primarily reflected $49.1 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, Market Stock Units, or MSUs, and Performance Stock Units, or PSUs, $15.5 net cash paid to acquire Emza, $15.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $74.5 million for repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of our short-term investments of $11.9 and $128.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of December 2022, $744.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate substantially all of these funds without impacting our provision for income taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Operating activities during the six months ended December 2022 generated $128.5 million compared with $180.7 million net cash generated during the six months ended December 2021. For the six months ended December 2022, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $141.0 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $99.1 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $6.7 million increase in inventories, a $69.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $62.1 million decrease in accounts payable, a $54.2 million decrease in accrued compensation and a $53.9 million decrease in income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities. During the six months ended December 2022, our days sales outstanding was 65 days compared to 67 days at the same period a year ago. Our annual inventory turns decreased from six to three over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities . Cash used by investing activities during the six months ended December 2022 was $18.8 million compared with $524.8 million during the six months ended December 2021. Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended December 2022 consisted of $11.9 million proceeds from the maturities of investments, partially offset by $15.5 net cash paid to acquire Emza and $15.3 million for purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 2022 was $115.0 million compared with $11.7 million provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 2021. Net cash used by financing activities for the six months ended December 2022 consisted of $8.8 million proceeds from issuance of shares, offset by $49.1 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs, and $74.5 million used to repurchase our common stock. Common Stock Repurchase Program . As of December 2022, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases, are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through December 2022, we purchased, net of issuances for settlement of our convertible notes, 28,877,798 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $769.0 million. During the six months ended December 2022, we repurchased 633,546 shares of our common stock. As of December 2022, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $502.9 million. 30 Senior Notes On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. 31 The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of December 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of December 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. 32 $100 Million Shelf Registration . We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs . We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the continuing or worsening impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently required to meet our United States working capital and other cash requirements, but should we repatriate a portion of these earnings, we may be required to pay certain previously accrued state and foreign taxes, which would impact our cash flows. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 2022 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,365.9 $ 29.7 $ 130.7 $ 128.9 $ 1,076.6 Leases 65.1 2.5 21.0 15.6 26.0 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 182.8 47.1 116.7 19.0 — Total $ 1,613.8 $ 79.3 $ 268.4 $ 163.5 $ 1,102.6 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $51.2 million. As of December 2022, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 33 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Except as described below, as of December 24, 2022, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. Interest Rate Risk on Debt With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan Facility, including changes that may result from implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR. See “Note 12. Debt” for further information. A hypothetical increase in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $5.9 million based on the outstanding balance of our Term Loan as of December 2022. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Although many of the restrictions and containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, some of our employees continue to work from home, or on a hybrid basis. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of December 24, 2022, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended December 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 34 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. IT EM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2025.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2023 and 2022 are 52-week periods ending June 24, 2023 and June 25, 2022, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week periods ended September 24, 2022, and September 25, 2021, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the pandemic related to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. As of September 2022 and June 2022, our cash and cash equivalents had a carrying value of $ 867.8 million and $ 824.0 million, respectively. Short-Term Investments We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term based on management’s intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method, and are reflected as other income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 2022 and June 2022, the total unrealized loss reported within accumulated other comprehensive loss was $ 1.9 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively. We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent a security’s fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security’s issuer, likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value. For our debt instruments, we also evaluate whether we have the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. 8 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and resulted in immaterial amounts in each of the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 9 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Balance Sheet Components, Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 1.4 million in contract assets recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 2022 and $ 1.2 million as of June 2022. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 29.9 million and $ 43.1 million, respectively, as of September 2022 and $ 27.3 million and $ 61.3 million, respectively, as of June 2022. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Balance Sheet Components. During the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021, we recognized $ 1.8 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of September 2022, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. 10 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and product category is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 64.6 $ 40.2 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.8 37.5 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 0.9 3.1 Shares, diluted 40.7 40.6 Net income per share: Basic $ 1.62 $ 1.07 Diluted $ 1.59 $ 0.99 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes, which were settled in August 2021. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 452,859 and 1,010 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): September June 2022 2022 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 94.6 $ 92.2 Finished goods 84.8 77.5 $ 179.4 $ 169.7 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 5. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by category at September 2022 and June 2022 (in millions): 11 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) September 2022 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Cash $ 418.8 $ - $ 418.8 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 390.9 - 390.9 Certificates of deposit 38.1 - 38.1 U.S. Treasury securities 20.0 20.0 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 867.8 $ - $ 867.8 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 2.0 $ - $ 2.0 Corporate debt securities 38.2 ( 2.0 ) 36.2 Municipal bonds 5.9 ( 0.1 ) 5.8 Total short-term investments $ 46.1 $ ( 2.1 ) $ 44.0 June 2022 Amortized Cost Gross unrealized gain (loss) Fair Value Cash $ 811.9 $ - $ 811.9 Cash equivalents: Money market funds 12.1 - 12.1 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 824.0 $ - $ 824.0 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit $ 2.4 $ - $ 2.4 Corporate debt securities 43.7 ( 1.9 ) 41.8 Municipal bonds 7.9 ( 0.1 ) 7.8 Total short-term investments $ 54.0 $ ( 2.0 ) $ 52.0 The following table classifies our short-term investments by contractual maturities (in millions): September 2022 June 2022 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due within 1 year $ 18.0 $ 17.5 $ 21.0 $ 20.4 Due between 1 year to 5 years 28.1 26.5 33.0 31.6 $ 46.1 $ 44.0 $ 54.0 $ 52.0 6. Fair Value Measurements We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets, and the fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use 12 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models. At September 2022 and June 2022, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions): September 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (1) Assets: Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 390.9 $ - $ - $ 390.9 U.S. Treasury Securities 20.0 - - 20.0 Certificates of deposit - 38.1 - 38.1 Short-term investments: Certificates of deposit - 2.0 - 2.0 Corporate debt securities - 36.2 - 36.2 Municipal bonds - 5.8 - 5.8 Total assets $ 410.9 $ 82.1 $ - $ 493.0 (1) Excludes $ 418.8 million in cash held in our bank accounts as of September 2022 .

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility. See Note 11 Debt. The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility was determined based on the trading price of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility are as follows for the periods presented (in millions): September 2022 June 2022 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Senior Notes due 2029 $ 395.1 $ 329.9 $ 395.0 $ 326.9 Term Loan Facility due 2028 585.7 582.0 586.7 $ 575.0 $ 980.8 $ 911.9 $ 981.7 $ 901.9 13 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 7.

During the three months ended September 2022, and September 2021, $ 23.5 million and $ 16.9 million, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included under operating expenses in acquired intangibles amortization. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There were no changes in our goodwill balance for the three months ended September 2022. 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2034 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years . For the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021, we recorded approximately $ 3.3 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively, of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial. As of September 2022 and June 2022, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): September June 2022 2022 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 58.0 $ 61.2 Operating lease liabilities $ 7.4 $ 7.6 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 48.7 51.5 Total operating lease liabilities $ 56.1 $ 59.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases, including from acquisitions, is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2022 2021 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 2.7 $ 3.0 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 1.4 6.6 14 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) As of September 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term is 7.9 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.4 % .

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. 15 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 11. Debt Senior Notes On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021was $ 4.1 million in each period. Revolving Credit Facility 16 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of September 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the Company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25 % or at the base rate plus 1.50 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis 17 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Term Loan Facility during the three months ended September 2022 was $ 6.9 million. Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. 12.

Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of October 29, 2019, no new awards may be granted under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated, and t he cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders is 5,288,000 as of October 25, 2022. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. N o new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 31,185 $ 61.50 Exercised ( 3,808 ) 88.53 Balance as of September 2022 27,377 57.75 $ 1.2 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 23, 2022 of $ 100.95 . Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2019, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2006. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. Accordingly, any reference to RSU is intended to signify both an RSU and a DSU. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. RSU activity was as follows: 19 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 1,220,573 Granted 627,743 Delivered ( 369,306 ) Forfeited ( 24,178 ) Balance as of September 2022 1,454,832 $ 146.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 23, 2022 of $ 100.95 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. Of the shares delivered, 106,071 shares valued at $ 13.8 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2023, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 300 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 300 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 80th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25th and 80th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2023, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 300 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25th and 75th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche 20 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 251,974 Granted 145,526 Delivered ( 144,831 ) Balance as of September 2022 252,669 $ 25.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 2022 of $ 100.95 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. Of the shares delivered, 75,831 shares valued at $ 10.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis by tranche. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 38.7 million as of September 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2010 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSU awards to our executive officers and other key management team members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which, generally, are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU award. Generally, PSU awards have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of performance relative to predefined performance criteria (for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2023 and prior to fiscal 2022 the performance criteria is based on non-GAAP earnings per share, for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2021 the performance criteria is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses). For our fiscal 2023 PSU awards, the potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. 21 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2022 257,903 Awarded 192,964 Released ( 112,070 ) Forfeited ( 3,904 ) Balance as of September 2022 334,893 $ 33.8 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 23, 2022 of $ 100.95 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. Of the shares delivered, 52,678 shares valued at $ 7.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 30.0 million as of September 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.1 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units to certain non-officer employees in October 2019 and there have been no subsequent phantom stock unit grants. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date, with the final vesting occurring on October 31, 2022. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 112.12 per unit at September 2022 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 17.5 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2022 176,097 Paid - Forfeited ( 2,178 ) Balance as of September 2022 173,919 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the three months ended September 2022 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 88,210 Weighted average purchase price $ 92.52 Cash received $ 9.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 1.4 22 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 13. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $ 39.1 million and $ 5.9 million for the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 8.4 million during the three months ended September 2022, to $ 38.2 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 2022 were $ 2.6 million; this balance increased by $ 0.1 million compared to June 2022. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2016 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to OEMs and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2022 2021 China $ 114.5 $ 135.1 Taiwan 180.7 119.6 Japan 106.3 91.6 Other 36.6 16.4 South Korea 5.6 8.2 United States 4.4 1.8 $ 448.1 $ 372.7 23 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Net revenue from our customers for each product category was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2022 2021 IoT product applications $ 342.7 $ 205.7 PC product applications 65.2 88.6 Mobile product applications 40.2 78.4 $ 448.1 $ 372.7 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended September 2022 2021 Customer A 13 % 12 % Customer B * 11 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: September June 2022 2022 Customer A 18 % 17 % Customer B 13 % 15 % 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of unrealized gains or losses on our available-for-sale securities. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities During fiscal 2022, we initiated various strategic restructuring actions primarily intended to reduce costs, gain synergies from our recent acquisitions and align our business in response to market conditions. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. As of September 2022, all of the restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2022 are complete. The following table summarizes the restructuring activity and related charges during the periods presented (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2022 September 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 1.4 $ 0.2 Charges - 1.4 Payments ( 1.2 ) ( 0.4 ) Balance, end of period $ 0.2 $ 1.2 24 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 24, 2022 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to the following: our dependence on our solutions for the IoT product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for IoT product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 Although many of the restrictions and other containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 and its variants have resulted in a variety of responses in the many geographic locations in which we do business, from no actions taken to the re-imposition of lockdowns and containment measures designed to mitigate or reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority, and a large number of our workforce has been vaccinated. Many of our employees that worked from home at the onset of COVID-19, or during subsequent lockdowns, have returned full-time or on a hybrid basis to our office environment. For those employees that have returned to the office, we continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread and vaccinate large portions of the population. However, if more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, we, our customers, and our suppliers could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. We will continue to evaluate the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to the ongoing pandemic. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, 25 Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes (as defined herein), Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Acquisitions DSP Group, Inc. In fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the equity of DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, for $22.00 per share of common stock, a total purchase consideration of $543.3 million. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and Term Loan Facility under our existing senior credit facility. The results of DSPG are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from December 3, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended September 2022, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. 26 Trends and Uncertainties Current Economic Conditions As many central banks continue to raise interest rates to combat inflation, the potential for global recession also rises. This threat of global recession appears to be driving increased caution in our customer base. During the quarter, we began to experience reduced customer demand combined with customer requests to delay orders. We are cautiously optimistic, and we believe that the demand slowdown is temporary, but if we do slip into a global recession, the rebound in demand may take longer than we currently anticipate. Further, the increase in interest rates will push up our borrowing costs on our variable rate Term Loan Facility, driving an increase in interest costs in future accounting periods and potentially limiting our borrowing capacity if a future acquisition opportunity requiring financing presents itself. Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended September 2022 2021 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 342.7 $ 205.7 $ 137.0 66.6 % PC product applications 65.2 88.6 (23.4 ) (26.4 %) Mobile product applications 40.2 78.4 (38.2 ) (48.7 %) Net revenue 448.1 372.7 75.4 20.2 % Gross margin 255.7 198.1 57.6 29.1 % Operating expenses: Research and development 89.5 86.1 3.4 3.9 % Selling, general, and administrative 44.7 41.6 3.1 7.5 % Acquired intangibles amortization 9.5 8.4 1.1 13.1 % Restructuring costs — 1.4 (1.4 ) (100.0 %) Operating income 112.0 60.6 51.4 84.8 % Interest and other expense, net (8.3 ) (5.9 ) (2.4 ) (40.7 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes — (8.1 ) 8.1 100.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 103.7 46.6 57.1 122.5 % Provision for income taxes 39.1 5.9 33.2 562.7 % Equity investment loss — 0.5 (0.5 ) (100.0 %) Net income $ 64.6 $ 40.2 $ 24.4 60.7 % Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point September Increase/ 2022 2021 (Decrease) IoT product applications 76.5 % 55.2 % 21.3 % PC product applications 14.5 % 23.8 % (9.3 %) Mobile product applications 9.0 % 21.0 % (12.0 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 57.1 % 53.2 % 3.9 % Operating expenses: Research and development 20.0 % 23.1 % (3.1 %) Selling, general, and administrative 10.0 % 11.2 % (1.2 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.1 % 2.3 % (0.2 %) Restructuring costs 0.0 % 0.4 % (0.4 %) Operating income 25.0 % 16.3 % 8.7 % Interest and other expense, net (1.9 %) (1.6 %) (0.3 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes 0.0 % (2.2 %) 2.2 % Income before provision for income taxes 23.1 % 12.5 % 10.6 % Provision for income taxes 8.7 % 1.6 % 7.1 % Equity investment loss 0.0 % 0.1 % (0.1 %) Net income 14.4 % 10.8 % 3.6 % 27 Net Revenue Net revenue was $448.1 million for the three months ended September 2022, compared with $372.7 million for the three months ended September 2021, an increase of $75.4 million, or 20.2%. Of this net revenue, $342.7 million, or 76.5%, was from IoT product applications, $65.2 million, or 14.5%, was from PC product applications, and $40.2 million, or 9.0%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the three months ended September 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT, offset by a decrease in net revenue from PC and mobile product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 59.2%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 4.5%) due to product sales mix. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold related to certain end customers' decline in demand and desire to decrease their inventory holdings (which decreased 39.6%) and partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 21.7%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 64.9%) as demand broadly softened for our products in the mobile market, partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 46.3%). Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 57.1%, or $255.7 million, for the three months ended September 2022, compared with 53.2%, or $198.1 million, for the three months ended September 2021. The 390-basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended September 2022, was due to an overall favorable product mix and an increase in average sales prices partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization included in cost of revenue. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses increased $3.4 million to $89.5 million for the three months ended September 2022, compared with $86.1 million for the three months ended September 2021. The increase in research and development expenses were primarily driven by an increase in payroll and other employee related costs of $7.2 million, which includes costs associated with research and development headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed December 2, 2021, a $1.6 million increase in new product development activities, partially offset by a $6.9 million decrease in share-based compensation costs primarily related to a decrease in our stock price reducing the accrued expense associated with cash settled phantom stock awards during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $3.1 million to $44.7 million for the three months ended September 2022, compared with $41.6 million for the three months ended September 2021. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $3.7 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increase in granted stock awards and grant date valuation partially offset by a decrease in our stock price during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period a year ago which impacted the expense associated with our phantom stock units and related accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $0.7 million. Acquired Intangibles Amortization . Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net, primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net increased by $2.4 million to $8.3 million for the three months ended September 2022, as compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 2021. The increase in interest and other expense, net, is primarily due to interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes issued in March 2021 and the $600 million incremental term loan facility executed in December 2021, partially offset by lower interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the convertible notes which were fully redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Provision for Income Taxes . We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to 28 several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $39.1 million and $5.9 million for the three months ended September 2022 and September 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 2022, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of tax law changes becoming effective in our fiscal 2023, including non-creditable foreign withholding taxes resulting from the final foreign tax credit regulations published in January 2022 and the research and development capitalization rules increasing our global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and non-deductible officer compensation, partially offset by the benefit of foreign income taxed at lower rates, and research credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $867.8 million as of September 2022, compared with $824.0 million as of June 2022, representing an increase of $43.8 million. The increase primarily reflected $31.4 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, Market Stock Units, or MSUs and Performance Stock Units, or PSUs, $6.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $13.4 million for repurchases of our common stock, offset by proceeds from maturities of our short-term investments of $7.7 and $78.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of September 2022, $741.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate these funds without impacting our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Operating activities during the three months ended September 2022 generated $78.5 million compared with $58.3 million net cash generated during the three months ended September 2021. For the three months ended September 2022, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $80.7 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $66.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $9.7 million increase in inventories, offset by a $37.7 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $17.6 million decrease in accounts payable, a $38.2 million decrease in accrued compensation and a decrease of $38.9 million in income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities. During the three months ended September 2022, our days sales outstanding was 57 days compared to 65 days at the same period a year ago. Our annual inventory turns decreased from seven to four over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities . Cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended September 2022 was $2.3 million compared with $4.7 million cash used by investing activities during the three months ended September 2021. Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended September 2022 consisted of $7.7 million proceeds from the maturities of investments, partially offset by $6.2 million for purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 2022 was $35.0 million compared with $542.1 million used by financing activities for the three months ended September 2021. Net cash used by financing activities for the three months ended September 2022 consisted of $8.5 million proceeds from issuance of shares, offset by $31.4 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs, and $13.4 million used to repurchase our common stock. Common Stock Repurchase Program . As of September 2022, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases, are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through September 2022, we purchased 28,244,252 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $707.9 million. During three months ended September 2022, we repurchased 119,631 shares of our common stock. As of September 2022, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $564.0 million. Senior Notes On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. 29 The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding 30 borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of September 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. $100 Million Shelf Registration . We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs . We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on variants of 31 COVID-19, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would impact our cash flows. 32 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 2022 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,261.3 $ 31.9 $ 95.0 $ 94.0 $ 1,040.4 Leases 68.2 3.9 19.3 16.9 28.1 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 227.5 93.5 115.0 19.0 — Total $ 1,557.0 $ 129.3 $ 229.3 $ 129.9 $ 1,068.5 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $38.2 million. As of September 2022, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 33 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of September 24, 2022, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Although many of the restrictions and containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, some of our employees continue to work from home, or on a hybrid basis. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of September 24, 2022, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 34 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. IT EM 2.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2022 and 2021 are 52-week periods ending June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week and 39-week periods ended March 26, 2022, and March 27, 2021, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the pandemic related to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of March 26, 2022 and June 26, 2021 , our cash equivalents included bank deposits with a carrying value of $ 158.6 million and $ 509.1 million, respectively, which approximates fair value, and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Short-Term Investments Our short-term investments have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate the classification at each balance sheet date. Our available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI, in stockholders’ equity. As of March 26, 2022, the total unrealized loss reported within AOCI was $ 1.3 million. At June 26, 2021, there were no unrealized gains or losses. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in immaterial amounts in each of the three and nine months ended March 26, 2022, and the three and nine months ended March 27, 2021 . 8 Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is 9 expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 1.0 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 26, 2022 and $ 1.9 million as of June 26, 2021. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 29.4 million and $ 53.2 million, respectively, as of March 26, 2022 and $ 7.0 million and $ 36.1 million, respectively, as of June 26, 2021. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Balance Sheet Components. During the three and nine months ended March 26, 2022 , we recognized $ 0.2 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. During the three and nine months ended March 27, 2021 , we recognized $ 0.3 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of March 26, 2022 , we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and product category is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 64.9 $ 13.8 $ 174.6 $ 60.6 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.5 35.0 38.8 34.7 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 1.2 4.1 1.9 2.8 Shares, diluted 40.7 39.1 40.7 37.5 Net income per share: Basic $ 1.64 $ 0.39 $ 4.50 $ 1.75 Diluted $ 1.59 $ 0.35 $ 4.29 $ 1.62 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes, which were settled in August 2021. 10 Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 68,521 and 32,109 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 , respectively, and 31,430 and 68,795 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the nine months ended March 26, 2022, and March 27, 2021 , respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Fair Value Our carrying values of cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; we currently do not have any bank borrowings, however, when we do have outstanding borrowing the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. Our investments, which we hold as available-for-sale, consist primarily of certificates of deposit and corporate and municipal bonds are measured at fair value based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets, or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable, such as interest rates or yield curves, or can be corroborated by observable market data. At March 26, 2022, approximately $ 25.4 million of our investments are expected to mature within one year , and approximately $ 39.2 million is expected to mature beyond one year . Our total investments are presented as short-term investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our $ 400.0 million principal amount of 4.0 % senior notes due 2029 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the senior notes as of March 26, 2022 and June 26, 2021 was approximately $ 375.5 million and $ 401.5 million, respectively, based on the last trading price of the senior notes for the respective periods. At March 26, 2022, our $ 600.0 million term loan due in December 2028 is a variable rate instrument and the carrying value of the term loan approximates its fair value. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): March June 2022 2021 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 76.9 $ 49.1 Finished goods 69.0 32.9 $ 145.9 $ 82.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 6. Acquisition DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021 , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc., or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG, a leading global provider of voice and wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, for $ 22.00 per share in an all-cash transaction, referred to as the DSPG acquisition. The DSPG acquisition closed on December 2, 2021 , or the DSPG Closing Date, whereupon we obtained voice and wireless technology and product solutions for converged communications. The DSPG acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The 11 excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at March 26, 2022, is preliminary and subject to change and has been based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of intangible assets acquired and related deferred income taxes. We expect to continue to obtain information for the purpose of determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date throughout the remainder of the measurement period. The adjusted purchase price paid to acquire DSPG was $ 543.3 million. The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.5 Short-term investments 71.9 Accounts receivable, net 12.9 Inventory 22.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4.0 Property and equipment 5.9 Intangible assets 199.5 Right-of-use lease asset 11.2 Severance pay fund 16.2 Deferred tax asset 6.4 Non-current other assets 2.3 Total identifiable assets acquired 393.4 Accounts payable ( 6.7 ) Other accrued expenses ( 19.0 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 9.4 ) Accrued severance ( 16.4 ) Deferred tax liability ( 38.1 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 3.3 ) Total liabilities ( 94.6 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 298.8 Goodwill 244.5 Net assets acquired $ 543.3 During the three months ended March 26, 2022, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments of $ 12.1 million to goodwill consisting of increases in non-current deferred tax assets of $ 6.1 million, $ 0.6 million in other accrued liabilities and $ 7.6 million relating to the acceleration of certain equity awards, offset by a decrease of $ 1.0 million in acquired in-process research and development. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 5.0 $ 107.5 Customer contracts and related relationships 4.0 65.0 In process research and development N/A 15.0 Backlog 1.0 11.0 Trade name 1.0 1.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 199.5 12 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 4% to 18%. The f air value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of advanced semiconductor telecommunications products for the Internet of Things, or IoT, market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in calendar year 2023 . The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DSPG as of the DSPG Closing Date. As of March 26, 2022 , no ne of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DSPG acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DSPG. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 44.6 million of revenue from DSPG Closing Date through March 26, 2022. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DSPG as we initiated the integration of a substantial portion of DSPG into our ongoing operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which was completed in the subsequent quarter. 7 . Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets (in millions): March 2022 June 2021 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.4 $ 189.6 $ ( 96.7 ) $ 92.9 $ 138.6 $ ( 97.6 ) $ 41.0 Customer relationships 4.1 $ 190.5 $ ( 91.4 ) 99.1 125.5 ( 63.8 ) 61.7 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 $ 128.0 $ ( 27.9 ) 100.1 93.0 ( 14.2 ) 78.8 Video interface technology 3.0 $ 82.0 $ ( 45.5 ) 36.5 82.0 ( 25.1 ) 56.9 Display driver technology 7.0 $ 20.4 $ ( 19.6 ) 0.8 20.4 ( 17.5 ) 2.9 Backlog 1.0 $ 11.0 $ ( 3.7 ) 7.3 12.0 ( 12.0 ) - Licensed technology and other 4.5 $ 9.9 $ ( 6.9 ) 3.0 13.0 ( 8.1 ) 4.9 Patents 8.0 $ 4.4 $ ( 3.6 ) 0.8 4.4 ( 3.2 ) 1.2 Tradename 4.4 $ 5.8 $ ( 2.8 ) 3.0 4.8 ( 1.7 ) 3.1 In process research and development Not applicable $ 66.0 - 66.0 51.0 - 51.0 Acquired intangibles totals 4.8 $ 707.6 $ ( 298.1 ) $ 409.5 $ 544.7 $ ( 243.2 ) $ 301.5 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 37.1 million and $ 27.5 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022, and March 27, 2021 , respectively, and $ 91.5 million and $ 84.5 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively. During the three months ended March 26, 2022, and March 27, 2021 , $ 25.1 million and $ 18.8 million, respectively, and $ 61.9 million and $ 60.4 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included under operating expenses in acquired intangibles amortization. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The changes in our goodwill balance for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 reflect our preliminary estimate of goodwill associated with the DSPG acquisition. 13 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2029 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years . For the nine months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 , we recorded approximately $ 9.1 million and $ 7.5 million, respectively, of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial. As of March 26, 2022, and June 26, 2021, the components of leases are as follows (in millions): March June 2022 2021 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 63.3 $ 31.7 Operating lease liabilities $ 8.8 $ 9.3 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 54.6 24.0 Total operating lease liabilities $ 63.4 $ 33.3 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases, including from acquisitions, is as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 2022 2021 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 9.1 $ 7.3 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 39.4 21.7 As of March 26, 2022 , the weighted average remaining lease term is 8.1 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.1 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2022 $ 1.5 2023 10.0 2024 9.3 2025 9.4 2026 9.1 Thereafter 37.2 Total future minimum operating lease payments 76.5 Less: interest ( 13.1 ) Total lease liabilities $ 63.4 Sale and Leaseback Transaction On February 8, 2022, we executed a sale and leaseback transaction of our properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California, for a purchase price, net of closing and other expenses payable by us, of $ 55.9 million. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the Buyer to lease back the land and properties located at 1109 and 1151 McKay Drive, San Jose, California, for an initial term of 12 years and a renewal option for an additional seven years . The transaction qualified for sale and leaseback and operating lease accounting classification, and we recorded a gain of $ 5.4 million which is recorded in the gain on sale and leaseback transaction line in the condensed consolidated statement of income in the third quarter of 2022. 14 9. Balance Sheet Components Other non-current assets consisted of the following (in millions): March June 2022 2021 Deferred income taxes $ 51.6 $ 28.3 Right-of-use assets 63.3 31.7 Security deposits 28.2 3.8 Other 20.6 20.6 $ 163.7 $ 84.4 Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): March June 2022 2021 Customer obligations $ 82.6 $ 43.1 Inventory obligations 13.9 17.0 Operating lease liabilities, short-term 8.8 9.3 Other 34.0 26.8 $ 139.3 $ 96.2 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): March June 2022 2021 Operating lease liabilities, long-term $ 54.6 $ 24.0 Deferred tax liability 56.1 27.1 Income taxes payable, long-term 33.6 15.4 Other 20.4 12.0 $ 164.7 $ 78.5 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 15 11. Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the three and nine months ended March 26, 2022 was $ 4.1 million and $ 12.4 million , respectively . The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 was $ 0.9 million. Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA 16 ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of March 26, 2022 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the Company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of March 26, 2022 , we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25 % or at the base rate plus 1.50 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. 17 The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Term Loan during both the three and nine months ended March 26, 2022, was $ 4.5 million and $ 5.9 million, respectively. Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2022 2021 2022 2021 Cost of revenue $ 0.9 $ 0.8 $ 3.2 $ 2.6 Research and development 18.0 12.9 57.4 33.4 Selling, general, and administrative 15.2 11.4 45.7 34.0 Total $ 34.1 $ 25.1 $ 106.3 $ 70.0 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ ( 3.4 ) $ ( 2.5 ) $ ( 20.1 ) $ ( 11.5 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2022 2021 2022 2021 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 Research and development 6.4 7.2 26.7 16.4 Selling, general, and administrative 1.4 1.5 5.6 3.5 Total $ 7.9 $ 8.8 $ 32.5 $ 20.2 18 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of October 29, 2019, no new awards may be granted under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated twice, effective October 27, 2020 and October 26, 2021, respectively. The cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 4,590,000 as of October 26, 2021. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. N o new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Outstanding as of June 2021 55,061 $ 66.68 Exercised ( 22,300 ) 73.30 Outstanding and Exercisable as of March 2022 32,761 62.18 $ 5.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 25, 2022 of $ 217.52 . Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2019, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2006. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. Accordingly, any reference to RSU is intended to signify both an RSU and a DSU. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. 19 RSU activity was as follows: Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 1,323,286 Granted 602,320 Delivered ( 549,596 ) Forfeited ( 147,461 ) Balance as of March 2022 1,228,549 $ 267.2 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 25, 2022 of $ 217.52 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. Of the shares delivered, 162,082 shares valued at $ 30.2 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted after fiscal 2020, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted after fiscal 2020, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. 20 MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 347,027 Granted 134,728 Delivered ( 203,883 ) Forfeited ( 25,898 ) Balance as of March 2022 251,974 $ 54.8 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 25, 2022 of $ 217.52 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. Of the shares delivered, 105,719 shares valued at $ 18.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis by tranche. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 19.8 million a s of March 26, 2022 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.0 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2010 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. Generally, the grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2022 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement result equals greater than 75 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 125 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable service period. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 317,392 Awarded 185,676 Released ( 208,023 ) Forfeited ( 37,142 ) Balance as of March 2022 257,903 $ 56.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 25, 2022 of $ 217.52 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. Of the shares delivered, 94,642 shares valued at $ 17.6 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. 21 We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 23.5 million as of March 26, 2022 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.0 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units to certain non-officer employees in October 2019 and there have been no subsequent phantom stock unit grants. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 218.56 per unit at March 26, 2022 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 15.7 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2021 402,458 Released ( 196,420 ) Forfeited ( 25,845 ) Balance as of March 2022 180,193 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the nine months ended March 26, 2022 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 138,502 Weighted average purchase price $ 97.91 Cash received $ 13.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 12.5 13. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $ 24.4 million and $ 10.4 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 26, 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 27, 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes and GILTI. 22 The provision for income taxes of $ 32.3 million and $ 16.4 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation and GILTI. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes and GILTI. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 14.4 million during the nine months ended March 26, 2022, to $ 37.0 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 26, 2022 were $ 2.7 million; this balance increased by $ 1.0 million compared to June 26, 2021. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In January 2022, final foreign tax credit regulations were issued by the U.S. Treasury modifying long established rules, including rules used in the determination of whether foreign taxes paid or accrued are creditable against U.S. income taxes. We are evaluating these new regulations and certain research and development capitalization rule changes, all effective beginning with our fiscal 2023, but anticipate our future provision for income taxes will be adversely affected. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to OEMs and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2022 2021 2022 2021 China $ 171.2 $ 130.9 $ 448.4 $ 406.2 Taiwan 140.1 101.5 387.3 268.1 Japan 127.9 67.5 339.0 258.9 Other 17.4 16.7 50.6 54.7 South Korea 8.6 8.5 27.5 20.0 United States 4.9 0.7 10.5 3.9 $ 470.1 $ 325.8 $ 1,263.3 $ 1,011.8 Net revenue from our customers for each product category was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2022 2021 2022 2021 IoT product applications $ 301.6 $ 151.4 $ 768.8 $ 435.0 PC product applications 90.1 98.4 261.4 270.4 Mobile product applications 78.4 76.0 233.1 306.4 $ 470.1 $ 325.8 $ 1,263.3 $ 1,011.8 23 A reclassification has been made to the prior periods revenue presentation in the above table in order to conform to the current period revenue presentation. The reclassification of $ 5.4 million and $ 19.5 million during the three and nine months ended March 2021, respectively, moved virtual reality product revenue from Mobile product applications to IoT product applications. Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2022 2021 2022 2021 Customer A 14 % 13 % 13 % 12 % Customer B 14 % 11 % 13 % 11 % Customer C * * * 16 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: March June 2022 2021 Customer A 21 % 15 % Customer B 10 % 12 % Customer C 10 % * 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of unrealized gains or losses on our available-for-sale securities. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities During fiscal 2022, we initiated restructuring activities which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. These activities are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2022. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2022 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance, June 26, 2021 $ - Accruals 2.6 Cash payments ( 1.1 ) Balance, March 26, 2022 $ 1.5 24 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated restructuring activities, which included severance costs for activities intended to gain synergies from the DSPG acquisition as well as accelerated vesting on equity awards. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income, and the restructuring activities are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2022. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2022 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance, June 26, 2021 $ - Accruals 7.6 Accelerated vesting on equity awards 7.6 Cash payments ( 12.1 ) Balance, March 26, 2022 $ 3.1 25 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2022 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to the following: our dependence on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; the risk that our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; global supply chain disruptions and component shortages that are currently affecting the semiconductor industry as a whole; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate, governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees have worked from home at times during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment, or as required by local governments, including ongoing mandatory lockdowns and forced quarantines in Shanghai. Many employees who have been fully vaccinated have returned to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis, where permitted. As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will continue to moderate the overall severity and duration and remain optimistic the most significant impact has passed. As more COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, some of which may be more infectious and may have greater resistance to the existing vaccines, we could experience episodes of renewed and sustained business disruption. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and we continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact of COVID-19 to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity 26 that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed semiconductor solutions that is changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. Our current served markets include Internet of Things, or IoT, personal computer, or PC, and Mobile. We deliver complete chip, firmware and software semiconductor solutions that include connectivity products, audio input and output System-On-Chips, or SoCs, high-definition video and vision SoCs, SoCs with artificial intelligence capabilities, touch controllers, touchpads, display drivers and fingerprint biometric sensors. We are a market leader in providing premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions to our target markets. Our Original Equipment Manufacturer, or OEM, customers include many of the world’s largest OEMs for smart home devices, automotive solutions, notebook computers and peripherals, smartphones and tablets, and many large OEMs for audio and video products. We generally supply our product solutions to our OEM customers through their contract manufacturers, which take delivery of our products and pay us directly for such products. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets rec ognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects loss on extinguishment of debt as discussed in Note 11 Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report, interest expense on our senior notes, convertible notes and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 27 The gain from the sale of our equity investment in OXI Technology Ltd., was recorded as part of the equity investment gain (loss) in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Acquisitions DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG for $22.00 per share of common stock. The transaction closed on December 2, 2021. As of March 26, 2022, our preliminary purchase consideration was $543.3 million, net of measurement period adjustments. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility under our existing senior credit facility. The results of DSPG are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from December 3, 2021. DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. Our purchase consideration was $444.0 million. The results of DisplayLink are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from August 1, 2020. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for periods from July 24, 2020. Divestitures In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended March 26, 2022, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. Trends and Uncertainties Supply Chain The availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their locations, and the extent to which they are impacted by logistical constraints, local COVID-19 protocols, or their allocation of available supply to us. We continue to monitor and proactively work with our supply chain partners to secure capacity to meet end-customer demand. Further, during fiscal 2022 we have seen input price increases from our supply chain partners; however, we have worked closely with many of our customers to pass-through these increases in a manner that has not materially impacted our results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 26, 2022. Workforce The ability to hire and secure critical hardware and software engineers to expand our research and development activities is currently constrained in many of the geographic markets in which we operate. The competition for available engineering talent has intensified for a variety of reasons resulting in wage inflation in the semiconductor development industry. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is critical to the long-term growth and success of our business. 28 Results of Operations Beginning in fiscal 2022, we are accounting for virtual reality revenue in IoT product applications rather than Mobile product applications. To conform the prior period revenue presentation to the current period revenue presentation, we reclassified $5.4 million and $19.5 million of virtual reality product revenue from Mobile product applications to IoT product applications for the three and nine months ended March 27, 2021, respectively. Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March Nine Months Ended March 2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2022 2021 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 301.6 $ 151.4 $ 150.2 99.2 % $ 768.8 $ 435.0 $ 333.8 76.7 % PC product applications 90.1 98.4 (8.3 ) (8.4 %) 261.4 270.4 (9.0 ) (3.3 %) Mobile product applications 78.4 76.0 2.4 3.2 % 233.1 306.4 (73.3 ) (23.9 %) Net revenue 470.1 325.8 144.3 44.3 % 1,263.3 1,011.8 251.5 24.9 % Gross margin 253.8 155.5 98.3 63.2 % 677.0 440.4 236.6 53.7 % Operating expenses: Research and development 98.2 77.5 20.7 26.7 % 273.2 235.7 37.5 15.9 % Selling, general, and administrative 44.2 36.8 7.4 20.1 % 130.1 111.6 18.5 16.6 % Acquired intangibles amortization 12.0 8.7 3.3 37.9 % 29.6 24.1 5.5 22.8 % Restructuring costs 11.3 0.9 10.4 1156 % 17.8 7.1 10.7 150.7 % Gain on sale of audio technology assets - - - 0.0 % - (34.2 ) 34.2 100.0 % Operating income 88.1 31.6 56.5 178.8 % 226.3 96.1 130.2 135.5 % Interest and other expense, net (6.7 ) (7.0 ) 0.3 4.3 % (18.3 ) (17.7 ) (0.6 ) (3.4 %) Gain from sale and leaseback 5.4 - 5.4 100.0 % 5.4 - 5.4 100.0 % Loss on redemption of convertible notes - - - - (8.1 ) - (8.1 ) - Income before provision for income taxes 86.8 24.6 62.2 252.8 % 205.3 78.4 126.9 161.9 % Provision for income taxes 24.4 10.4 14.0 134.6 % 32.3 16.4 15.9 97.0 % Equity investment loss 2.5 (0.4 ) 2.9 725.0 % 1.6 (1.4 ) 3.0 214.3 % Net income $ 64.9 $ 13.8 $ 51.1 370.3 % $ 174.6 $ 60.6 $ 114.0 188.1 % 29 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Nine Months Ended Percentage Point March Increase/ March Increase/ 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2022 2021 (Decrease) IoT product applications 64.2 % 46.5 % 17.7 % 60.9 % 43.0 % 17.9 % PC product applications 19.2 % 30.2 % (11.0 %) 20.7 % 26.7 % (6.0 %) Mobile product applications 16.7 % 23.3 % (6.6 %) 18.4 % 30.3 % (11.9 %) Net revenue 100.1 % 100.0 % 0.1 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 54.0 % 47.7 % 6.3 % 53.6 % 43.5 % 10.1 % Operating expenses: Research and development 20.9 % 23.8 % (2.9 %) 21.6 % 23.3 % (1.7 %) Selling, general, and administrative 9.4 % 11.3 % (1.9 %) 10.3 % 11.0 % (0.7 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.6 % 2.7 % (0.1 %) 2.3 % 2.4 % (0.1 %) Restructuring costs 2.4 % 0.3 % 2.1 % 1.4 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Gain on sale of audio technology assets 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % (3.4 %) 3.4 % Operating income 18.7 % 9.7 % 9.0 % 17.9 % 9.5 % 8.4 % Interest and other expense, net (1.4 %) (2.1 %) 0.7 % (1.4 %) (1.7 %) 0.3 % Gain from sale and leaseback 1.1 % 0.0 % 1.1 % 0.4 % 0.0 % 0.4 % Loss on redemption of convertible notes 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % (0.6 %) 0.0 % (0.6 %) Income before provision for income taxes 18.5 % 7.6 % 10.9 % 16.3 % 7.7 % 8.6 % Provision for income taxes 5.2 % 3.2 % 2.0 % 2.6 % 1.6 % 1.0 % Equity investment loss 0.5 % (0.1 %) 0.6 % 0.1 % (0.1 %) 0.2 % Net income 13.8 % 4.2 % 9.6 % 13.8 % 6.0 % 7.8 % Net Revenue Net revenue was $470.1 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022, compared with $325.8 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021, an increase of $144.3 million, or 44.3%. Of this net revenue, $301.6 million, or 64.2%, was from IoT product applications, $90.1 million, or 19.2%, was from PC product applications, and $78.4 million, or 16.7%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the three months ended March 26, 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT and Mobile product applications, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from PC product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 66%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 19.9%) due to product sales mix. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold related to certain end customers' supply chain constraints (which decreased 30.6%) and partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 31.9%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications increased due to higher average selling prices (which increased 12.4%) and partially offset by a decline in units sold (which decreased 8.2%). Net revenue was $1,263.3 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022, compared with $1,011.8 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, an increase of $251.5 million, or 24.9%. Of this net revenue, $768.8 million, or 60.9%, was from IoT product applications, $261.4 million, or 20.7%, was from PC product applications, and $233.1 million, or 18.4%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from PC and Mobile product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 34.4%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 31.5%) due to product sales mix. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 19.4%) partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 19.9%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 25.2%) for Mobile product applications partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 1.7%) due to our product sales mix. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 54.0%, or $253.8 million, for the three months ended March 26, 2022, compared with 47.7%, or $155.5 million, for the three months ended March 27, 2021. The 630 basis point increase in gross margin for 30 the three months ended March 26, 2022, was due to an overall favorable product mix and an increase in average sales prices partially offset by a $9.2 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization and inventory fair value adjustments included in cost of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 53.6% or $677.0 million, for the nine months ended March 26, 2022, compared with 43.5%, or $440.4 million, for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. The 1,010 basis point increase in gross margin for the nine months ended March 26, 2022, was due to an overall favorable product mix driven and an increase in average sales prices as well as a $13.2 million decrease in acquired intangibles amortization and inventory fair value adjustments included in cost of revenue. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses increased $20.7 million to $98.2 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022, compared with $77.5 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $5.1 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $10.8 million, which includes costs associated with research and development headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021. Research and development expenses increased $37.5 million to $273.2 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022, compared with $235.7 for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $24.0 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual, an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $13.3 million, which includes costs associated with research and development headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million to $44.2 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022, compared with $36.8 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $3.8 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $2.8 million, which includes costs associated with additional selling, general, and administrative headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $18.5 million to $130.1 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022, compared with $111.6 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $11.7 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $6.0 million, which includes costs associated with additional selling, general, and administrative headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021. Acquired Intangibles Amortization . Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs . Restructuring costs of $11.3 million in the three months ended March 26, 2022 are primarily related to activities intended to gain synergies from our recent DSPG acquisition as well as an acceleration of vesting on certain equity awards. Restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2022 and are expected to be complete by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For further discussion of restructuring costs, see Note 16 Restructuring Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring costs of $17.8 million in the nine months ended March 26, 2022 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs and for activities intended to gain synergies from our recent DSPG acquisition as well as an acceleration of vesting on certain equity awards. Restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2022 and are expected to be complete by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net, primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and a gain recognized on settlement of a supplier agreement. Interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.3 million to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022, as compared to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021. 31 Interest and other expense, net, increased $0.6 million to $18.3 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022, as compared to $17.7 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. The increase in interest and other expense, net, is primarily due to interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes issued in March 2021 and the $600 million incremental term loan facility executed in December 2021, partially offset by lower interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the convertible notes which were partially redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and fully redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Gain from sale and leaseback transaction . Gain from sale and leaseback transaction represents the gain from the sale of our headquarters buildings and properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California. The sale and leaseback transaction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. For further discussion of the sale and leaseback transaction, see Note 8 Leases to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Loss on redemption of convertible notes . Loss on redemption of convertible notes, which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, represents the difference between fair value and the carrying value as of the redemption date. Provision for Income Taxes . We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $24.4 million and $10.4 million for the three months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 26, 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 27, 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes and GILTI. The provision for income taxes of $32.3 million and $16.4 million for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation and GILTI. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes and GILTI. In January 2022, final foreign tax credit regulations were issued by the U.S. Treasury modifying long established rules, including rules used in the determination of whether foreign taxes paid or accrued are creditable against U.S. income taxes. We are evaluating these new regulations and certain research and development capitalization rule changes, all effective beginning with our fiscal 2023, but anticipate our future provision for income taxes will be adversely affected. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $690.3 million as of March 26, 2022, compared with $836.3 million as of June 26, 2021, representing a decrease of $146.0 million. The decrease primarily reflected $505.6 million used for the payment for the redemption of convertible notes, net cash paid to acquire DSPG of $504.8 million, $66.1 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, Market Stock Units, or MSUs and Performance Stock Units, or PSUs, $26.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment, offset by proceeds from the term loan facility of $588.8, net of debt issuance costs paid of $11.2 million, proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $55.9 million and $308.4 million of net cash provided by operating activities. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of March 26, 2022, $563.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate these funds without impacting our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Operating activities during the nine months ended March 26, 2022 generated $308.4 million compared with $214.3 million net cash generated during the nine months ended March 27, 2021. For the nine months ended March 26, 2022, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $164.5 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $30.7 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $57.3 32 million increase in accounts receivable, a $41.3 million increase in inventories, $21.1 million increase in accounts payable, and an increase of $31.1 million in income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities. For the nine months ended March 27, 2021, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $126.3 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $27.4 million.

Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 consisted of $626.5 million used for the acquisition of businesses and $15.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $95.8 million in proceeds from maturities of investments and $34.2 million of proceeds from sale of audio technology assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities . Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 was $16.9 million compared with $294.0 million used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 26, 2022 consisted of proceeds received from the term loan facility of $588.8 million (net of debt issuance costs paid of $11.2 million) and $15.1 million proceeds from issuance of shares, offset by a $505.6 million payment for redemption of convertible notes, $66.1 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs, and $16.6 million used for refundable deposit paid to vendor. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 consisted of $400.0 million of proceeds from issuance of debt and $26.9 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by primarily a $100.0 million payment on line of credit borrowings and $27.0 million used for payroll taxes on RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. Common Stock Repurchase Program . As of March 26, 2022, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through March 26, 2022, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the nine months ended March 26, 2022, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of March 26, 2022, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $577.4 million. Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % 33 In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of March 26, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is 34 based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of March 26, 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. $100 Million Shelf Registration . We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs . We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including acquisitions, and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on variants of COVID-19, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which could adversely impact our financial position. 35 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 26, 2022 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,118.5 $ 9.5 $ 44.0 $ 44.0 $ 1,021.0 Leases 76.5 1.5 19.4 18.5 37.1 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 280.2 46.9 176.2 57 - Transition tax payable (3) 7.4 0.3 4.1 3.0 Total $ 1,482.6 $ 58.2 $ 243.7 $ 122.6 $ 1,058.1 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $37.0 million. As of March 26, 2022, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 36 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March 26, 2022, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. On December 2, 2021, we completed the DSPG acquisition. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we excluded DSPG from our evaluation for the period ended March 26, 2022. We are in the process of integrating DSPG into our system of internal control over financial reporting. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended March 26, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 37 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. IT EM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2025. As of March 26, 2022, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $577.4 million. During the three-month period ended March 26, 2022, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. 38 IT EM 6.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2022 and 2021 are 52-week periods ending June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week and 26-week periods ended December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the pandemic related to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 25, 2021 and June 26, 2021 , our cash equivalents included bank deposits with a carrying value of $ 167.2 million and $ 509.1 million, respectively, which approximates fair value, and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Short-Term Investments Our short-term investments have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate the classification at each balance sheet date. Our available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI, in stockholders’ equity. As of December 25, 2021, the total unrealized loss reported within AOCI was $ 0.1 million. At June 26, 2021, there were no unrealized gains or losses. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in immaterial amounts in each of the three and six months ended December 25, 2021, and the three and six months ended December 26, 2020 . 8 Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Asset Sale and Leaseback Transaction On November 24, 2021, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Escrow Instructions, or the Purchase Agreement, with S B C & D Co., Inc. d/b/a South Bay Development Company, or South Bay, as amended, pursuant to which the parties agreed to consummate a sale and leaseback transaction, or the Transaction. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to sell our properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California, or the Real Property, to South Bay or its affiliate, or the Buyer, for a total purchase price of $58.0 million. The net proceeds will be reduced by transaction commissions and expenses payable by us and incurred in connection with the Transaction. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we will enter into a lease agreement, or the Lease Agreement, with Buyer pursuant to which we will lease back from the Buyer the portion of the Real Property located at 1109 and 1151 McKay Drive, San Jose, California for an initial twelve-year term, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreement. We shall have the option to extend the Lease Agreement for one additional seven-year term upon written notice to the Buyer no earlier than twelve months and no later than nine months before the end of the initial term. We anticipate that the closing of the Transaction will occur in February 2022, subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions for transactions of this type. In connection with the Transaction, we presented the net book value of the Real Property of $ 50.8 million as non-current assets held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2021 . 9 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 1.2 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 25, 2021 and $ 1.9 million as of June 26, 2021 . Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 20.2 million and $ 50.8 million, respectively, as of December 25, 2021 and $ 7.0 million and $ 36.1 million, respectively, as of June 26, 2021. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the six months ended December 25, 2021, and the six months ended December 26, 2020 , we recognized $ 3.3 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of December 25, 2021 , we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and product category is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 10 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 69.5 $ 49.6 $ 109.7 $ 46.8 Denominator: Shares, basic 39.4 34.8 38.5 34.5 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 1.3 1.7 2.2 1.9 Shares, diluted 40.7 36.5 40.7 36.4 Net income per share: Basic $ 1.76 $ 1.43 $ 2.85 $ 1.36 Diluted $ 1.71 $ 1.36 $ 2.70 $ 1.29 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes, which were settled in August 2021. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 12,987 and 179,491 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 , respectively, and 10,209 and 502,657 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the six months ended December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Fair Value Our carrying values of cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; we currently do not have any bank borrowings, however, when we do have outstanding borrowing the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. Our investments, which we hold as available-for-sale, consist primarily of certificates of deposit and corporate and municipal bonds are measured at fair value based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets, or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable, such as interest rates or yield curves, or can be corroborated by observable market data. At December 25, 2021, approximately $ 23.2 million of our investments are expected to mature within one year , and approximately $ 47.9 million is expected to mature beyond one year . Our total investments are presented as short-term investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our $ 400.0 million principal amount of 4.0 % senior notes due 2029 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the senior notes as of December 25, 2021 and June 26, 2021 was approximately $ 408.0 million and $ 401.5 million, respectively, based on the last trading price of the senior notes for the respective periods. At December 25, 2021, our $ 600.0 million term loan due in December 2028 is a variable rate instrument and the carrying value of the term loan approximates its fair value. 11 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): December June 2021 2021 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 79.5 $ 49.1 Finished goods 53.8 32.9 $ 133.3 $ 82.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 6. Acquisition DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021 , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc., or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG, a leading global provider of voice and wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, for $ 22.00 per share in an all-cash transaction, referred to as the DSPG acquisition. The DSPG acquisition closed on December 2, 2021 , or the DSPG Closing Date, whereupon we obtained voice and wireless technology and product solutions for converged communications. The DSPG acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at December 25, 2021, is preliminary and subject to change and has been based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of intangible assets acquired and related deferred income taxes. We expect to continue to obtain information for the purpose of determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date throughout the remainder of the measurement period. The purchase price paid to acquire DSPG was $ 550.9 million. 12 The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.5 Short-term investments 71.9 Accounts receivable, net 12.9 Inventory 22.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4.0 Property and equipment 5.9 Intangible assets 200.5 Right-of-use lease asset 11.2 Severance pay fund 16.2 Deferred tax asset 0.3 Non-current other assets 2.3 Total identifiable assets acquired 388.3 Accounts payable ( 6.7 ) Other accrued expenses ( 18.4 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 9.4 ) Accrued severance ( 16.4 ) Deferred tax liability ( 38.1 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 3.3 ) Total liabilities ( 94.0 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 294.3 Goodwill 256.6 Net assets acquired $ 550.9 The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 5.0 $ 107.5 Customer contracts and related relationships 4.0 65.0 In process research and development N/A 16.0 Backlog 1.0 11.0 Trade name 1.0 1.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 200.5 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 4% to 18%. The f air value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of advanced semiconductor telecommunications products for the Internet of Things, or IoT, market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in calendar year 2023 . The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DSPG as of the DSPG Closing Date. As of December 25, 2021 , no ne of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 13 Prior to the DSPG acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DSPG. The condensed consolidated financial statements include $ 11.3 million of revenue from DSPG from the DSPG Closing Date, and a net loss of $ 16.4 million through December 25, 2021 . 7 . Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets (in millions): December 2021 June 2021 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.6 $ 189.6 $ ( 87.7 ) $ 101.9 $ 138.6 $ ( 97.6 ) $ 41.0 Customer relationships 4.4 $ 190.5 $ ( 80.2 ) 110.3 125.5 ( 63.8 ) 61.7 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 $ 128.0 $ ( 22.5 ) 105.5 93.0 ( 14.2 ) 78.8 Video interface technology 3.0 $ 82.0 $ ( 38.7 ) 43.3 82.0 ( 25.1 ) 56.9 Display driver technology 7.0 $ 20.4 $ ( 19.0 ) 1.4 20.4 ( 17.5 ) 2.9 Backlog 1.0 $ 11.0 $ ( 0.9 ) 10.1 12.0 ( 12.0 ) - Licensed technology and other 4.5 $ 9.9 $ ( 6.3 ) 3.6 13.0 ( 8.1 ) 4.9 Patents 8.0 $ 4.4 $ ( 3.4 ) 1.0 4.4 ( 3.2 ) 1.2 Tradename 4.4 $ 5.8 $ ( 2.3 ) 3.5 4.8 ( 1.7 ) 3.1 In process research and development Not applicable $ 67.0 - 67.0 51.0 - 51.0 Acquired intangibles totals 5.5 $ 708.6 $ ( 261.0 ) $ 447.6 $ 544.7 $ ( 243.2 ) $ 301.5 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 29.2 million and $ 31.6 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , respectively, and $ 54.4 million and $ 57.0 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. During the three months ended December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , $ 19.9 million and $ 22.9 million, respectively, and $ 36.8 million and $ 41.6 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The changes in our goodwill balance for the six months ended December 25, 2021 reflect our preliminary estimate of goodwill associated with the acquisition of DSPG. 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2029 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years . For the six months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 , we recorded approximately $ 5.7 million and $ 5.0 million, respectively, of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial.

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 11. Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) 16 dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 was $ 4.1 million and $ 8.3 million , respectively . Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of December 25, 2021 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the Company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of net debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, 17 and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of December 25, 2021 , we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $ 600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028 . Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00 % per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25 % or at the base rate plus 1.50 %, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $ 11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Term Loan during both the three and six months ended December 25, 2021, was $ 1.4 million. Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of the our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $ 505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2021 2020 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 1.3 $ 1.0 $ 2.3 $ 1.8 Research and development 18.6 9.5 39.4 20.5 Selling, general, and administrative 16.7 12.9 30.5 22.6 Total $ 36.6 $ 23.4 $ 72.2 $ 44.9 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ ( 11.4 ) $ ( 5.4 ) $ ( 16.7 ) $ ( 9.0 ) 18 Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2021 2020 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 Research and development 8.4 3.4 20.2 9.2 Selling, general, and administrative 1.7 0.7 4.3 2.0 Total $ 10.2 $ 4.2 $ 24.6 $ 11.4 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of October 29, 2019, no new awards may be granted under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated twice, effective October 27, 2020 and October 26, 2021, respectively. The cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 4,590,000 as of October 26, 2021. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. N o new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Outstanding as of June 2021 55,061 $ 66.68 Exercised ( 19,684 ) 72.39 Outstanding and Exercisable as of December 2021 35,377 63.51 $ 7.6 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2021 of $ 278.28 . 19 Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2019, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2006. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. Accordingly, any reference to RSU is intended to signify both an RSU and a DSU. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. RSU activity was as follows: Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 1,323,286 Granted 541,669 Delivered ( 502,701 ) Forfeited ( 82,694 ) Balance as of December 2021 1,279,560 $ 356.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2021 of $ 278.28 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. Of the shares delivered, 149,743 shares valued at $ 27.6 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted after fiscal 2020, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. 20 For MSU awards granted after fiscal 2020, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. Of the shares delivered, 105,719 shares valued at $ 18.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 347,027 Granted 134,728 Delivered ( 203,883 ) Forfeited ( 18,554 ) Balance as of December 2021 259,318 $ 72.2 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2021 of $ 278.28 . We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 25.5 million a s of December 25, 2021 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2010 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. Generally, the grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2022 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement result equals greater than 75 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 125 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such 21 withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. Of the shares delivered, 94,642 shares valued at $17.6 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 317,392 Awarded 185,676 Released ( 208,023 ) Forfeited ( 22,741 ) Balance as of December 2021 272,304 $ 75.8 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 23, 2021 of $ 278.28 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 31.7 million as of December 25, 2021 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units to certain non-officer employees in October 2019 and there have been no subsequent phantom stock unit grants. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 277.85 per unit at December 25, 2021 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 7.9 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2021 402,458 Released ( 196,420 ) Forfeited ( 18,217 ) Balance as of December 2021 187,821 The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 44.3 million as of December 25, 2021 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.9 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the six months ended December 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 96,475 Weighted average purchase price $ 74.98 Cash received $ 7.2 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.5 22 13. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $ 2.0 million and $ 2.4 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 25, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI. The provision for income taxes of $ 7.9 million and $ 6.0 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 25, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 26, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 9.0 million during the six months ended December 25, 2021 , to $ 31.6 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 were $ 2.4 million; this balance increased by $ 0.7 million compared to June 26, 2021. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the IoT product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to OEMs and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2021 2020 2021 2020 China $ 142.1 $ 144.1 $ 277.2 $ 275.3 Taiwan 127.6 94.8 247.1 166.6 Japan 119.5 88.3 211.1 191.4 Other 16.8 22.0 33.3 38.0 South Korea 10.7 6.5 18.9 11.5 United States 3.8 1.9 5.6 3.2 $ 420.5 $ 357.6 $ 793.2 $ 686.0 23 Net revenue from our customers for each product category was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2021 2020 2021 2020 IoT product applications $ 261.5 $ 163.0 $ 467.2 $ 283.7 PC product applications 82.7 91.5 171.3 172.0 Mobile product applications 76.3 103.1 154.7 230.3 $ 420.5 $ 357.6 $ 793.2 $ 686.0 A reclassification has been made to the prior periods revenue presentation in the above table in order to conform to the current period revenue presentation. The reclassification of $ 7.9 million and $ 14.2 million during the three and six months ended December 2020, respectively, moved virtual reality product revenue from Mobile product applications to IoT product applications. Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2021 2020 2021 2020 Customer A 13 % * 12 % 11 % Customer B 12 % 13 % 12 % 11 % Customer C * 18 % * 20 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: December June 2021 2021 Customer A 16 % 12 % Customer B 10 % 15 % 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated restructuring activities which included severance costs which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. These activities are expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2022 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance, June 26, 2021 $ 0.2 Accruals 2.2 Cash payments ( 0.8 ) Balance as of December 2021 $ 1.6 24 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated restructuring activities, which included severance costs for activities intended to gain synergies from the DSPG acquisition. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income, and the restructuring activities are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2022. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2022 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance, June 26, 2021 $ - Accruals 4.3 Cash payments ( 0.9 ) Balance as of December 2021 $ 3.4 25 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 25, 2021 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning.

Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate, governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees have worked from home since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. As the broad roll-out of vaccines continues in various countries in which we operate, many employees who have been fully vaccinated have returned to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis. As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will continue to moderate the overall severity and duration and remain optimistic the most significant impact has passed. As more COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, some of which may be more infectious and may have greater resistance to the existing vaccines, we could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and we continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity. 26 We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact of COVID-19 to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed semiconductor solutions that is changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. Our current served markets include Internet of Things, or IoT, personal computer, or PC, and Mobile. We deliver complete chip, firmware and software semiconductor solutions that include connectivity products, audio input and output System-On-Chips, or SoCs, high-definition video and vision SoCs, SoCs with artificial intelligence capabilities, touch controllers, touchpads, display drivers and fingerprint biometric sensors. We are a market leader in providing premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions to our target markets. Our Original Equipment Manufacturer, or OEM, customers include many of the world’s largest OEMs for smart home devices, automotive solutions, notebook computers and peripherals, smartphones and tablets, and many large OEMs for audio and video products. We generally supply our product solutions to our OEM customers through their contract manufacturers, which take delivery of our products and pay us directly for such products. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets rec ognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 27 Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects loss on extinguishment of debt as discussed in Note 11 Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report, interest expense on our senior notes, convertible notes and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Acquisitions DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG for $22.00 per share of common stock. The transaction closed on December 2, 2021, for purchase consideration of $550.9 million. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility under our existing senior credit facility. The results of DSPG are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from December 3, 2021. DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. Our purchase consideration was $444.0 million. The results of DisplayLink are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from August 1, 2020. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for periods from July 24, 2020. Divestitures In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended December 25, 2021, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. 28 Results of Operations Beginning in fiscal 2022, we are accounting for virtual reality revenue in IoT product applications rather than Mobile product applications. To conform the prior period revenue presentation to the current period revenue presentation, we reclassified $7.9 million and $14.1 million virtual reality product revenue from Mobile product applications to IoT product applications for the three and six months ended December 26, 2020, respectively. Certain o f the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended December Six Months Ended December 2021 2020 $ Change % Change 2021 2020 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 261.5 $ 163.0 $ 98.5 60.4 % $ 467.2 $ 283.7 $ 183.5 64.7 % PC product applications 82.7 91.5 (8.8 ) (9.6 %) 171.3 172.0 (0.7 ) (0.4 %) Mobile product applications 76.3 103.1 (26.8 ) (26.0 %) 154.7 230.3 (75.6 ) (32.8 %) Net revenue 420.5 357.6 62.9 17.6 % 793.2 686.0 107.2 15.6 % Gross margin 225.1 150.4 74.7 49.7 % 423.2 284.9 138.3 48.5 % Operating expenses: Research and development 88.9 77.3 11.6 15.0 % 175.0 158.2 16.8 10.6 % Selling, general, and administrative 44.3 39.5 4.8 12.2 % 85.9 74.8 11.1 14.8 % Acquired intangibles amortization 9.2 8.7 0.5 5.7 % 17.6 15.4 2.2 14.3 % Restructuring costs 5.1 0.6 4.5 750.0 % 6.5 6.2 0.3 4.8 % Gain on sale of audio technology assets - (34.2 ) 34.2 100.0 % - (34.2 ) 34.2 100.0 % Operating income 77.6 58.5 19.1 32.6 % 138.2 64.5 73.7 114.3 % Interest and other expense, net (5.7 ) (6.0 ) 0.3 5.0 % (11.6 ) (10.7 ) (0.9 ) (8.4 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes - - - - (8.1 ) - (8.1 ) - Income before provision for income taxes 71.9 52.5 19.4 37.0 % 118.5 53.8 64.7 120.3 % Provision for income taxes 2.0 2.4 (0.4 ) (16.7 %) 7.9 6.0 1.9 31.7 % Equity investment loss (0.4 ) (0.5 ) 0.1 20.0 % (0.9 ) (1.0 ) 0.1 10.0 % Net income $ 69.5 $ 49.6 $ 19.9 40.1 % $ 109.7 $ 46.8 $ 62.9 134.4 % 29 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Six Months Ended Percentage Point December Increase/ December Increase/ 2021 2020 (Decrease) 2021 2020 (Decrease) IoT product applications 62.2 % 45.6 % 16.6 % 58.9 % 41.3 % 17.6 % PC product applications 19.7 % 25.6 % (5.9 %) 21.6 % 25.1 % (3.5 %) Mobile product applications 18.1 % 28.8 % (10.7 %) 19.5 % 33.6 % (14.1 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 53.5 % 42.1 % 11.4 % 53.4 % 41.5 % 11.9 % Operating expenses: Research and development 21.1 % 21.6 % (0.5 %) 22.1 % 23.1 % (1.0 %) Selling, general, and administrative 10.5 % 11.0 % (0.5 %) 10.8 % 10.9 % (0.1 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.2 % 2.4 % (0.2 %) 2.2 % 2.2 % 0.0 % Restructuring costs 1.2 % 0.2 % 1.0 % 0.8 % 0.9 % (0.1 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets 0.0 % (9.6 %) 9.6 % 0.0 % (5.0 %) 5.0 % Operating income 18.5 % 16.4 % 2.1 % 17.4 % 9.4 % 8.0 % Interest and other expense, net (1.4 %) (1.7 %) 0.3 % (1.5 %) (1.6 %) 0.1 % Loss on redemption of convertible notes 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % (1.0 %) 0.0 % (1.0 %) Income before provision for income taxes 17.1 % 14.7 % 2.4 % 14.9 % 7.8 % 7.1 % Provision for income taxes 0.5 % 0.7 % (0.2 %) 1.0 % 0.9 % 0.1 % Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income 16.5 % 13.9 % 2.6 % 13.8 % 6.8 % 7.0 % Net Revenue Net revenue was $420.5 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021, compared with $357.6 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, an increase of $62.9 million, or 17.6%. Of this net revenue, $261.5 million, or 62.2%, was from IoT product applications, $82.7 million, or 19.7%, was from PC product applications, and $76.3 million, or 18.1%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the three months ended December 25, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from PC and Mobile product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 11.1%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 44.3%) due to product sales mix. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold related to certain end customers' supply chain constraints (which decreased 24.8%) and partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 20.4%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold to one or more mobile c ustomers and partially offset by slightly higher average selling prices. Net revenue was $793.2 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021, compared with $686.0 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020, an increase of $107.2 million, or 15.6%. Of this net revenue, $467.2 million, or 58.9%, was from IoT product applications, $171.3 million, or 21.6%, was from PC product applications, and $154.7 million, or 19.5%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the six months ended December 25, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from PC and Mobile product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 19.6%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 37.7%) due to product sales mix, both of which reflect only a partial quarter impact in the September 2020 quarter of our acquisitions of DisplayLink and the Broadcom wireless business. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 12.8%) partially offset by higher average selling prices (which increased 14.1%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 30.7%) for Mobile product applications and lower average selling prices (which decreased 3.1%) due to our product sales mix . Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 53.5%, or $225.1 million, for the three months ended December 25, 2021, compared with 42.1%, or $150.4 million, for the three months ended December 26, 2020. The 1,140 basis point increase in gross 30 margin for the three months ended December 25, 2021, was due to an overall favorable product mix and an increase in average sales prices as well as a $7.8 million decrease in inventory fair value adjustments. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 53.4% or $423.2 million, for the six months ended December 25, 2021, compared with 41.5%, or $284.9 million, for the six months ended December 26, 2020. The 1,190 basis point increase in gross margin for the six months ended December 25, 2021, was due to an overall favorable product mix driven and an increase in average sales prices as well as a $17.6 million decrease in inventory fair value adjustments. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses increased $11.6 million to $88.9 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021, compared with $77.3 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $9.0 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $3.0 million, which includes a partial month of costs associated with research and development headcount from our acquisition of DSPG, which closed on December 2, 2021. Research and development expenses increased $16.8 million to $175.0 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021, compared with $158.2 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $18.9 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual, an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $2.5 million, which includes a partial month of costs associated with research and development headcount from our acquisition of DSPG, which closed on December 2, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in software license and maintenance fees of $4.1 million. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million to $44.3 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021, compared with $39.5 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $3.8 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $1.3 million, which includes a partial month of costs associated with additional selling, general, and administrative headcount from our acquisition of DSPG, which closed on December 2, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains and losses of $1.3 million. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $11.1 million to $85.9 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021, compared with $74.8 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $7.9 million increase in share-based compensation costs primarily related to an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual and an increase in payroll and variable compensation costs of $3.1 million, which includes a partial month of costs associated with additional selling, general, and administrative headcount from our acquisition of DSPG, which closed on December 2, 2021. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $5.1 million in the three months ended December 25, 2021 are primarily related to activities intended to gain synergies from our recent acquisition of DSPG . Restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2022 and are expected to be complete by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For further discussion of restructuring costs, s ee Note 16 R estructuring Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring costs of $6.5 million in the six months ended December 25, 2021 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs and for activities intended to gain synergies from our recent acquisition of DSPG . Restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2022 and are expected to be complete by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net, primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 31 Interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.3 million to $5.7 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021, as compared to $6.0 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020. Interest and other expense, net, increased $0.9 million to $11.6 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021, as compared to $10.7 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020. The increase in interest and other expense, net, is primarily due to interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes issued in March 2021 and the $600 million incremental term loan facility executed in December 2021, partially offset by lower interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the convertible notes which were partially redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and fully redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Loss on redemption of convertible notes. Loss on redemption of convertible notes, which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, represents the difference between fair value and the carrying value as of the redemption date. Provision for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $2.0 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 25, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of income taxed at lower rates, the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI. The provision for income taxes of $7.9 million and $6.0 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 25, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and GILTI. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 26, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $502.8 million as of December 25, 2021, compared with $836.3 million as of June 26, 2021, representing a decrease of $333.5 million. The decrease primarily reflected $505.6 million used for the payment for the redemption of convertible notes, net cash paid to acquire DSPG of $512.2 million, $63.5 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, Market Stock Units, or MSUs and Performance Stock Units, or PSUs, $13.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment, offset by proceeds from the term loan facility of $588.8, net of debt issuance costs paid of $11.2 million, and $180.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of December 25, 2021, $399.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate these funds without impacting our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the six months ended December 25, 2021 generated $180.7 million compared with $77.9 million net cash generated during the six months ended December 26, 2020. For the six months ended December 25, 2021, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $123.8 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $52.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $70.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $28.7 million increase in inventories, $29.8 million increase in accounts payable, and an increase of $55.1 million in other accrued liabilities, offset by a decrease of $18.9 million increase in accrued compensation. 32 Operating activities during the six months ended December 26, 2020 consisted of adjustments for non-cash charges of $75.2 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $44.1 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $46.9 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a $24.6 million decrease in accrued compensation, $15.3 million decrease in income taxes payable and a $11.9 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $62.0 million decrease in inventories. During the six months ended December 25, 2021, our days sales outstanding increased slightly from 63 days to 67 days. Our annual inventory turns decreased from seven to six over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 25, 2021 consisted of $524.8 million compared with $518.0 million net cash used during the six months ended December 26, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 25, 2021 consisted of $512.2 million for the acquisition of DSPG and $13.2 million for purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 26, 2020 consisted of $623.0 million used for acquisition of businesses and $12.2 million for purchases of property and equipment offset by $88.0 million in proceeds from maturities of investments and $34.2 million of proceeds from sale of audio technology assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 25, 2021 was $11.7 million compared with $14.6 million used in financing activities for the six months ended December 26, 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 25, 2021 consisted of proceeds received from the term loan facility of $588.8 million (net of debt issuance costs paid of $11.2 million) and $8.6 million proceeds from issuance of shares, offset by a $505.6 million payment for redemption of convertible notes, $63.5 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs, and $16.6 million used for refundable deposit paid to vendor. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 26, 2020 consisted of $11.2 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, offset by $25.8 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 25, 2021, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through December 25, 2021, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the six months ended December 25, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of December 25, 2021, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $577.4 million. Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. 33 The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility. On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of December 25, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is 34 expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of December 25, 2021, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Term Loan Facility. On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance our acquisition of DSPG. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant. The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including acquisitions, and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on variants of COVID-19, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which could adversely impact our financial position. 35 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 1,120.0 $ 11.0 $ 44.0 $ 44.0 $ 1,021.0 Leases 50.2 5.9 16.8 13.3 14.2 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 184.4 73.3 111.1 - - Transition tax payable (3) 7.4 0.3 4.1 3.0 - Total $ 1,362.0 $ 90.5 $ 176.0 $ 60.3 $ 1,035.2 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $31.6 million. As of December 25, 2021, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 36 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December 25, 2021, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. On December 2, 2021, we completed the acquisition of DSPG. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we excluded DSPG from our evaluation for the period ended December 25, 2021. We are in the process of integrating DSPG into our system of internal control over financial reporting. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended December 25, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 37 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. IT EM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2025. As of December 25, 2021, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $577.4 million. During the three-month period ended December 25, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. 38 IT EM 6.

STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2022 and 2021 are 52-week periods ending June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week periods ended September 25, 2021, and September 26, 2020, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents as of September 25, 2021 and as of June 26, 2021 included bank deposits with a carrying value of $ 0.9 million and $ 509.1 million, respectively, which approximates fair value, and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in immaterial amounts in each of the three months ended September 25, 2021, and the three months ended September 26, 2020 . Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease 7 ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. 8 Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 1.2 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 25, 2021 and $ 1.9 million as of June 26, 2021 . Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 11.2 million and $ 42.5 million, respectively, as of September 25, 2021 and $ 7.0 million and $ 36.1 million, respectively, as of June 26, 2021. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the three months ended September 25, 2021, and the three months ended September 26, 2020 , we recognized $ 2.9 million and $ 0.6 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of September 25, 2021 , we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income (Loss) Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 40.2 $ ( 2.8 ) Denominator: Shares, basic 37.5 34.2 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 3.1 - Shares, diluted 40.6 34.2 Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ 1.07 $ ( 0.08 ) Diluted $ 0.99 $ ( 0.08 ) Our basic net income (loss) per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, $ 0.001 par value, or the common stock, outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the ""treasury stock"" method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income (loss) per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 1,010 and 1,827,212 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 , respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 9 4. Fair Value Our carrying values of cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; we currently do not have any bank borrowings, however, when we do have outstanding borrowing the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. The fair value of our $ 400.0 million principal amount of 4.0 % senior notes due 2029 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the senior notes as of September 25, 2021 and June 26, 2021 was approximately $ 411.5 million and $ 401.5 million, respectively, based on the last trading price of the senior notes for the period. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): September June 2021 2021 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 52.1 $ 49.1 Finished goods 36.6 32.9 $ 88.7 $ 82.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. 6. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets (in millions): September 2021 June 2021 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.9 $ 117.1 $ ( 81.2 ) $ 35.9 $ 138.6 $ ( 97.6 ) $ 41.0 Customer relationships 4.2 125.5 ( 71.6 ) 53.9 125.5 ( 63.8 ) 61.7 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 93.0 ( 18.1 ) 74.9 93.0 ( 14.2 ) 78.8 Video interface technology 3.0 82.0 ( 31.9 ) 50.1 82.0 ( 25.1 ) 56.9 Display driver technology 7.0 20.4 ( 18.2 ) 2.2 20.4 ( 17.5 ) 2.9 Backlog Not applicable — — — 12.0 ( 12.0 ) — Licensed technology and other 4.5 9.9 ( 5.6 ) 4.3 13.0 ( 8.1 ) 4.9 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 3.3 ) 1.1 4.4 ( 3.2 ) 1.2 Tradename 5.1 4.8 ( 1.9 ) 2.9 4.8 ( 1.7 ) 3.1 In process research and development Not applicable 51.0 — 51.0 51.0 — 51.0 Acquired intangibles totals 5.5 $ 508.1 $ ( 231.8 ) $ 276.3 $ 544.7 $ ( 243.2 ) $ 301.5 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 25.2 million and $ 25.4 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021, and September 26, 2020, respectively. During the three months ended September 25, 2021, and September 26, 10 2020 , $ 16.9 million and $ 18.7 million, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There were no changes in our goodwill balance for the three months ended September 25, 2021 . 7. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2029 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years . For the three months ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 , we recorded approximately $ 2.8 million and $ 2.4 million, respectively, of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial.

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 10. Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. 12 Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after June 15, 2024, w e may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the three months ended September 25, 2021 was $ 4.1 million . Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of September 25, 2021 , there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 13 Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100 % of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the Company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 25, 2021 , we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Convertible Debt On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, the Redemption, for all $ 525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0 % of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021, or the Redemption Price. Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate is equal to 13.7267 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of the our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we paid $ 505.6 million in cash for the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $ 8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report. After the Redemption, we no longer have convertible debt outstanding. 14 11. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 1.0 $ 0.8 Research and development 20.8 11.0 Selling, general, and administrative 13.8 9.7 Total $ 35.6 $ 21.5 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ ( 5.3 ) $ ( 3.6 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ — $ 0.1 Research and development 11.8 5.8 Selling, general, and administrative 2.6 1.3 Total $ 14.4 $ 7.2 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of October 29, 2019, no new awards may be granted under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan has been amended and restated twice, effective October 27, 2020 and October 26, 2021, respectively. The cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 4,590,000 as of October 26, 2021. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. 15 Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and 650,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan was intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. As of November 27, 2020, no new awards may be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Outstanding as of June 2021 55,061 $ 66.68 Exercised ( 7,515 ) 81.56 Outstanding and Exercisable as of September 2021 47,546 64.33 $ 5.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 24, 2021 of $ 187.64 . Restricted Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2019, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors with initial grants occurring in 2006. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. Accordingly, any reference to RSU is intended to signify both an RSU and a DSU. RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. RSU activity was as follows: Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 1,323,286 Granted 444,973 Delivered ( 269,076 ) Forfeited ( 40,537 ) Balance as of September 2021 1,458,646 $ 273.7 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 24, 2021 of $ 187.64 . On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. Of the shares delivered, 76,511 shares valued at $ 13.0 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. 16 Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted after fiscal 2020, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted after fiscal 2020, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. Of the shares delivered, 58,994 shares valued at $ 9.9 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 347,027 Granted 65,000 Performance adjustment 33,675 Delivered ( 113,845 ) Forfeited ( 11,617 ) Balance as of September 2021 320,240 $ 60.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 24, 2021 of $ 187.64 . We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our 17 outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 31.1 million a s of September 25, 2021 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2010 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. Generally the grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2022 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 75 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 125 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. Of the shares delivered, 28,366 shares valued at $ 4.8 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2021 317,392 Awarded 96,914 Performance adjustment 17,489 Released ( 61,826 ) Forfeited ( 5,445 ) Balance as of September 2021 364,524 $ 68.4 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 24, 2021 of $ 187.64 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 40.1 million as of September 25, 2021 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units to certain non-officer employees in October 2019 and there have been no subsequent phantom stock unit grants. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average 18 closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 185.18 per unit at September 25, 2021 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 32.8 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2021 402,458 Forfeited ( 9,411 ) Balance as of September 2021 393,047 The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 40.0 million as of September 25, 2021 , which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.1 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the three months ended September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 96,475 Weighted average purchase price $ 74.98 Cash received $ 7.2 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.5 12. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $ 5.9 million and $ 3.6 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 25, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 0.8 million during the three months ended September 25, 2021 , to $ 23.4 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 25, 2021 were $ 1.8 million; this balance increased by $ 0.1 million compared to June 26, 2021. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $ 1.1 million to an increase of $ 2.5 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 19 13. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market.

Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: September June 2021 2021 Customer A 15 % 12 % Customer B 13 % 15 % 20 14. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 15. Restructuring Activities During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated restructuring activities which included severance costs which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. These activities are expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2022 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 1.4 Cash payments ( 0.2 ) Balance as of September 2021 $ 1.2 16. Pending Acquisition On August 30, 2021 , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity interests in DSPG for $ 22.00 per share of common stock issued and outstanding. We intend to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. We have received a customary commitment for incremental debt financing for $ 600.0 million in support of the transaction, which incremental term loan facility will be incurred under our existing senior credit facility. The transaction is expected to close in our second quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to approval by DSPG stockholders and satisfaction of certain closing conditions. 21 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 25, 2021 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to the following: our dependence on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; the risk that our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by heath epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; global supply chain disruptions and component shortages that are currently affecting the semiconductor industry as a whole; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate, governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees have worked from home since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. As the broad roll out of vaccines continues in various countries in which we operate, many employees who have been fully vaccinated have returned to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis. As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will continue to moderate the overall severity and duration and remain optimistic the most significant impact has passed. If more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, however, we could experience renewed and sustained business disruption. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity. 22 We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed semiconductor solutions that is changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. Our current served markets include Internet of Things, or IoT, personal computer, or PC, and Mobile. We deliver complete chip, firmware and software semiconductor solutions that include connectivity products, audio input and output System-On-Chips, or SoCs, high-definition video and vision SoCs, SoCs with artificial intelligence capabilities, touch controllers, touchpads, display drivers and fingerprint biometric sensors. We are a market leader in providing premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions to our target markets. Our Original Equipment Manufacturer, or OEM, customers include many of the world’s largest OEMs for smart home devices, automotive solutions, notebook computers and peripherals, smartphones and tablets, and many large OEMs for audio and video products. We generally supply our product solutions to our OEM customers through their contract manufacturers, which take delivery of our products and pay us directly for such products. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets rec ognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects loss on extinguishment of debt as discussed in Note 10 Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, interest expense on our senior notes, convertible notes and 23 revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Acquisitions DSP Group, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc, or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity interests in DSPG for $22.00 per share of common stock issued and outstanding. We intend to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. We have received a customary commitment for incremental debt financing for $600.0 million in support of the transaction, which incremental term loan facility will be incurred under our existing senior credit facility. The transaction is expected to close in our second quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions. DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. Our purchase consideration was $444.0 million. The results of DisplayLink are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from August 1, 2020. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for periods from July 24, 2020. Divestitures In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended September 25, 2021, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. 24 Results of Operations Beginning in the three months ended September 25, 2021, we are accounting for virtual reality revenue in IoT product applications rather than Mobile product applications. To conform the prior period revenue presentation to the current period revenue presentation, we reclassified $6.3 million virtual reality product revenue from Mobile product applications to IoT product applications for the three months ended September 26, 2020. Certain o f the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended September 2021 2020 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 205.7 $ 120.7 $ 85.0 70.4 % PC product applications 88.6 80.5 8.1 10.1 % Mobile product applications 78.4 127.2 (48.8 ) (38.4 %) Net revenue 372.7 328.4 44.3 13.5 % Gross margin 198.1 134.5 63.6 47.3 % Operating expenses: Research and development 86.1 80.9 5.2 6.4 % Selling, general, and administrative 41.6 35.3 6.3 17.8 % Acquired intangibles amortization 8.4 6.7 1.7 25.4 % Restructuring costs 1.4 5.6 (4.2 ) (75.0 %) Operating income 60.6 6.0 54.6 910.0 % Interest and other expense, net (5.9 ) (4.7 ) (1.2 ) (25.5 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes (8.1 ) — (8.1 ) 100.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 46.6 1.3 45.3 3484.6 % Provision for income taxes 5.9 3.6 2.3 63.9 % Equity investment loss (0.5 ) (0.5 ) — 0.0 % Net income (loss) $ 40.2 $ (2.8 ) $ 43.0 1535.7 % Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point September Increase/ 2021 2020 (Decrease) IoT product applications 55.2 % 36.8 % 18.4 % PC product applications 23.8 % 24.5 % (0.7 %) Mobile product applications 21.0 % 38.7 % (17.7 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 53.2 % 41.0 % 12.2 % Operating expenses: Research and development 23.1 % 24.6 % (1.5 %) Selling, general, and administrative 11.2 % 10.7 % 0.5 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.3 % 2.0 % 0.3 % Restructuring costs 0.4 % 1.7 % (1.3 %) Operating income 16.3 % 1.8 % 14.5 % Interest and other expense, net (1.6 %) (1.4 %) (0.2 %) Loss on redemption of convertible notes (2.2 %) 0.0 % (2.2 %) Income before provision for income taxes 12.5 % 0.4 % 12.1 % Provision for income taxes 1.6 % 1.1 % 0.5 % Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.2 %) 0.1 % Net income (loss) 10.8 % (0.9 %) 11.7 % 25 Net Revenue Net revenue was $372.7 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021, compared with $328.4 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, an increase of $44.3 million, or 13.5%. Of this net revenue, $205.7 million, or 55.2%, was from IoT product applications, $88.6 million, or 23.8%, was from PC product applications, and $78.4 million, or 21.0%, was from Mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue for the three months ended September 25, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications and PC product applications, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 30.7%) as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 30.5%) due to product sales mix, both of which reflect only a partial quarter impact in the September 2020 quarter of our acquisitions of DisplayLink and the Broadcom wireless business. Net revenue from PC product applications increased primarily as a result of higher average selling prices (which increased 8.8%) due to our product sales mix. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold (which decreased 34.2%) for Mobile product applications and lower average selling prices (which decreased 6.3%) due to our product sales mix . Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 53.2%, or $198.1 million, for the three months ended September 25, 2021, compared with 41.0%, or $134.5 million, for the three months ended September 26, 2020. The 1,220 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended September 25, 2021, was primarily due to a favorable product mix, an increase in average sales prices, product cost reductions, as well as a $9.8 million decrease in inventory fair value adjustments that were completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and were associated with the DisplayLink acquisition. Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses increased $5.2 to $86.1 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021, compared with $80.9 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $9.8 million increase in share-based compensation costs which were incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2021 and the first three months of fiscal 2022 and an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual, partially offset by a decrease in software licenses and maintenance, project related costs and non-employee services. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $6.3 million to $41.6 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021, compared with $35.3 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $4.0 million increase in share-based compensation costs which were incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2021 and the first three months of fiscal 2021 and an increased stock price which impacted the value of the new grants and the phantom stock units accrual, as well as a $1.8 million increase in personnel and related costs due to an increase in variable compensation. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 6 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $1.4 million in the three months ended September 25, 2021 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs. Restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2022 are expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. For further discussion of restructuring costs, s ee Note 15 R estructuring Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes interest on our debt, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net increased $1.2 million to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021, as compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020. The increase in interest and other expense, net is primarily due to interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes issued in March 2021 and $1.2 million income from the sale of non-operating assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which did not repeat in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, 26 partially offset by lower interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the convertible notes which were partially redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and fully redeemed in the three months ended September 25, 2021. Loss on redemption of convertible notes. Loss on redemption of convertible notes, which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and was completed in the three months ended September 25, 2021, represents the difference between fair value and the carrying value as of the redemption date. Provision for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $5.9 million and $3.6 million for the three months ended September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 25, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $347.3 million as of September 25, 2021, compared with $836.3 million as of June 26, 2021, representing a decrease of $489.0 million. The decrease primarily reflected $505.6 million used for the payment for the redemption of convertible notes, $27.7 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, Market Stock Units, or MSUs and Performance Stock Units, or PSUs, $16.6 million for a refundable deposit paid to a vendor, and $4.7 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $58.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities and $7.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of shares. We consider almost all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely invested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of September 25, 2021, $279.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be able to repatriate these funds without impacting our tax provision. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the three months ended September 25, 2021 generated $58.3 million compared with $6.5 million net cash generated during the three months ended September 26, 2020. For the three months ended September 25, 2021, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $63.1 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $45.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $41.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $12.3 million decrease in accrued compensation, a $7.4 million increase in other assets, a $6.9 million decrease in income taxes payable, a $6.7 million increase in inventories, and a $5.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $24.0 million increase in other accrued liabilities and a $10.7 million increase in accounts payable. From June 26, 2021 to September 25, 2021, our days sales outstanding increased slightly from 63 days to 65 days. Our annual inventory turns increased from six to seven over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 25, 2021 consisted of $4.7 million for purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 26, 2020 consisted of $621.8 million used for acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and $3.9 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $31.1 million of proceeds from maturities of investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 25, 2021 was $542.1 million compared with $4.8 million provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 26, 2020. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 25, 2021 consisted of $505.6 million payment for redemption of convertible notes, $27.7 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs, and $16.6 million used for refundable deposit paid to vendor, partially offset by $7.8 million proceeds from issuance of shares. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 26, 2020 consisted of $10.4 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $5.6 million used for payroll taxes on the delivery of the underlying shares for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. 27 Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of September 25, 2021, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through September 25, 2021, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the three months ended September 25, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of September 25, 2021, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $577.4 million. Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Bank Credit Facility. On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the 28 closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of September 25, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 25, 2021, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of us, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, anticipated cash flows from financing activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including acquisitions, and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on variants of COVID-19, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, 29 timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which could adversely impact our financial position. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 528.0 $ 16.0 $ 32.0 $ 32.0 $ 448.0 Leases 41.2 7.8 13.5 10.0 9.9 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 210.3 99.3 111.0 — — Transition tax payable (3) 7.4 0.3 4.1 3.0 — Total $ 786.9 $ 123.4 $ 160.6 $ 45.0 $ 457.9 The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $23.4 million. As of September 25, 2021, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 30 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of September 25, 2021, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. IT EM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 25, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 31 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. L EGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. IT EM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.8 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2025. As of September 25, 2021, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $577.4 million. During the three-month period ended September 25, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. 32 IT EM 6.

condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) 7 SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2021 and 2020 are 52-week periods ending June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week and 39-week periods ended March 27, 2021, and March 28, 2020, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents as of March 27, 2021 included bank deposits with a carrying value of $ 350.9 million, which approximates fair value, and as of June 27, 2020 they included money market accounts with a carrying value of $ 521.1 million, which approximates fair value, and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $ 0.3 million and $ 1.4 million in the three and nine months ended March 27, 2021, respectively, and net losses of $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million in the three and nine months ended March 28, 2020, respectively. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our 8 obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in ASC Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 0.6 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 27, 2021 and $ 0.4 million as of June 27, 2020. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 4.9 million and $ 33.7 million, respectively, as of March 27, 2021, and $ 3.2 million and $ 25.8 million, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During each of the nine months ended March 27, 2021, and the nine months ended March 28, 2020, we recognized $ 1.4 million in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. 9 We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of March 27, 2021, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 13.8 $ 5.0 $ 60.6 $ 28.8 Denominator: Shares, basic 35.0 34.0 34.7 33.5 Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes 4.1 1.0 2.8 1.0 Shares, diluted 39.1 35.0 37.5 34.5 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.39 $ 0.15 $ 1.75 $ 0.86 Diluted $ 0.35 $ 0.14 $ 1.62 $ 0.83 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 32,109 and 345,783 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, and 68,795 and 800,857 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 10 4. Fair Value Our carrying values of cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. The convertible notes are recorded at amortized cost of $ 500.9 million and $ 486.6 million as of March 27, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively and the fair value of the convertible notes was approximately $ 978.1 and $ 542.5 million as of March 27, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively, based on the last trading price of the convertible notes for the periods presented. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): March June 2021 2020 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 43.3 $ 53.6 Finished goods 26.0 48.4 $ 69.3 $ 102.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 6 . Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 % of equity interest in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology, for $ 305 million in cash adjusted for (i) estimated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the closing (ii) estimated indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the closing, (iii) unpaid portion as of the closing of certain transaction expenses incurred by DisplayLink, and (iv) the amount that the estimated working capital of DisplayLink exceeds or falls short, respectively, of a certain specified target working capital set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with $ 3.1 million of the purchase price held in escrow accounts for adjustments after closing and to secure the Seller Parties’ indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 , or the DisplayLink Closing Date, whereupon we obtained high-performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at March 27, 2021, is preliminary and has been based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. 11 The adjusted purchase price paid for DisplayLink was $ 444.0 million. The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.9 Short-term investments 94.0 Accounts receivable, net 7.1 Inventory 33.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 9.1 Property and equipment 6.8 Intangible assets 193.0 Right-of-use lease asset 20.0 Non-current other assets 0.6 Total identifiable assets acquired 404.6 Accounts payable ( 5.2 ) Other accrued liabilities ( 9.1 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 18.2 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 31.8 ) Total liabilities ( 66.0 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 338.6 Goodwill 105.4 Net assets acquired $ 444.0 During the nine months ended March 27, 2021, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments of $ 1.9 million to goodwill comprising of increases of $ 2.3 million in prepaid expenses and decreases of $ 0.8 million to other accrued liabilities and increases of $ 0.4 million in other long-term liabilities for a net increase of $ 2.7 million to the fair value of other acquired net tangible assets. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 3.0 $ 82.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 3.0 54.0 In process research and development N/A 51.0 Trade names 4.0 3.0 Licensed technology 2.5 3.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 193.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 11.0% to 11.5%. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to 12 derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions . In-process research and development consists of a next generation docking and video interface products for the IoT market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in early fiscal 2023. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DisplayLink as of the DisplayLink Closing Date. As of March 27, 2021, none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DisplayLink acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DisplayLink. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 78.9 million of revenue from DisplayLink from the DisplayLink Closing Date through March 27, 2021. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DisplayLink as we integrated a substantial portion of DisplayLink into our ongoing operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 . The following unaudited pro forma financial information (in millions, except per share data) presents the combined results of operations for us and DisplayLink as if the DisplayLink acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the actual operating results that would have been recorded had the DisplayLink acquisition actually taken place on June 30, 2019 and should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated operating results. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma financial results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits from the DisplayLink acquisition. Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 (1) 2020 2021 (1) 2020 Revenue $ 325.8 $ 359.1 $ 1,019.1 $ 1,138.2 Net income/(loss) 20.9 3.2 61.5 ( 1.0 ) (1) Includes results of Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income/(loss) included adjustments for historical amortization expense, the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, transaction costs and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for the three months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 were an increase to net income/(loss) of $ 7.1 million and a decrease of $ 9.4 million, respectively. The total pro forma adjustments for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 were an increase to net income/(loss) of $ 7.3 million and a decrease of $ 25.7 million, respectively. Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business On July 2, 2020 , we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $ 250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020 , or the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years . We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business . The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date is preliminary and was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. 13 The following table summarizes the adjusted purchase price paid for the Broadcom Business Acquisition (in millions): Cash $ 250.1 Adjustments to consideration transferred, net 1.5 Roadmap products - estimated cost of development ( 25.0 ) $ 226.6 We entered into a derivative and roadmap product agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Broadcom. The derivative and roadmap product agreement includes the purchase of derivative and roadmap product development services to be performed by Broadcom. We estimated the value of the development services to be approximately $ 25.0 million, accounted for it separate from the business combination, and included $ 10.0 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $ 15.0 million ($ 8.3 million after amortization as of March 27, 2021) in non-current other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The estimated value of the development services is amortizing over the period of time estimated to complete the development or approximately thirty months. The amortization of the estimated cost of development is included in research and development in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In addition, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees and Broadcom agreed to make cash payments to transferred employees as incentive to accept employment offers from our company. We determined $ 3.5 million of value related to these arrangements should be included as consideration transferred, which was partially offset by $ 2.0 million of cash payments to transferred employees as a reduction of consideration transferred. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Property and equipment $ 1.0 Acquired intangible assets 123.0 Total identifiable assets acquired 124.0 Liabilities assumed ( 0.2 ) Goodwill 102.8 Net assets acquired $ 226.6 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which is 2.2 % for order backlog and 13.0 % for the rest of the intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimate of the intangible assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 6.0 $ 93.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 6.0 18.0 Order backlog 0.5 12.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 123.0 14 The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Broadcom Business assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. As of March 27, 2021, all of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Broadcom Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Broadcom. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 63.8 million of revenue from the Broadcom Business Acquisition from the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date through March 27, 2021. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Broadcom Business Acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition into our ongoing operations at the close . We determined it is impractical to include pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information for the Broadcom Business Acquisition as the business was part of Broadcom and did not have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate. Divestiture In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction, licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $ 35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $ 34.2 million. Investment In December 2020, we invested $ 5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a partnership which enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. 7. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets (in millions): March 2021 June 2020 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.4 $ 138.6 $ ( 92.7 ) $ 45.9 $ 138.6 $ ( 76.5 ) $ 62.1 Customer relationships 4.2 125.5 ( 55.7 ) 69.8 81.8 ( 61.4 ) 20.4 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 93.0 ( 10.3 ) 82.7 $ - $ - $ - Video interface technology 3.0 82.0 ( 18.2 ) 63.8 $ - $ - $ - Display driver technology 7.0 20.4 ( 16.8 ) 3.6 164.0 ( 158.2 ) 5.8 Backlog 0.5 12.0 ( 12.0 ) - $ - $ - $ - Licensed technology and other 4.1 13.0 ( 7.5 ) 5.5 7.70 ( 5.5 ) 2.2 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 3.0 ) 1.4 4.4 ( 2.6 ) 1.8 Tradename 5.1 4.8 ( 1.4 ) 3.4 1.8 ( 0.7 ) 1.1 In process research and development N/A 51.0 $ - 51.0 $ - $ - $ - Acquired intangibles totals 5.1 $ 544.7 $ ( 217.6 ) $ 327.1 $ 398.3 $ ( 304.9 ) $ 93.4 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 27.5 million and $ 11.1 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, and $ 84.5 million and $ 40.4 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 and 15 March 28, 2020 , respectively . During the three months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 , $ 18.9 million and $ 8.1 mil lion, respectively, and $ 60.5 million and $ 31.6 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 , respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of March 27, 2021 (in millions): Remainder of 2021 $ 25.6 2022 99.0 2023 86.1 2024 25.9 2025 19.0 Thereafter 20.5 To be determined 51.0 Future amortization $ 327.1 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Changes in our goodwill balance for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 were as follows (in millions): Beginning balance $ 360.8 Acquisition activity 208.2 Ending balance $ 569.0 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2029 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the nine months ended March 27, 2021, we recorded approximately $ 7.5 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of March 27, 2021, the components of leases and lease costs are as follows (in millions): March June 2021 2020 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 35.1 $ 21.0 Operating lease liabilities $ 9.7 $ 6.5 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 26.9 14.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 36.6 $ 21.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 2021 2020 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 7.3 $ 7.1 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 21.7 2.8 16 As of March 27, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term is 6.2 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.0 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2021 $ 2.7 2022 10.1 2023 6.3 2024 4.8 2025 4.0 Thereafter 13.4 Total future minimum operating lease payments 41.3 Less: interest ( 4.7 ) Total lease liabilities $ 36.6 9.

Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. 17 Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 11. Debt Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $ 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000 % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date . We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024 , we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes. Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $ 5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 was $ 0.9 million. 18 Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Convertible Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Convertible Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances, including (1) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (the Sales Price Condition) or (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day (the Trading Price Condition). The Sales Price Condition was met on March 31, 2021, and became effective April 1, 2021. Holders of our Convertible Notes have the right to redeem their notes during the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2021. Generally, settlement will occur two trading days following the 40 consecutive trading day observation period or approximately two months after receipt of the holder’s conversion notice. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. This criteria has been met as of March 27, 2021. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Convertible Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Convertible Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Convertible Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Convertible Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount and legal, accounting, and printing costs, pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Convertible Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Convertible Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . 19 The contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, were as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 2021 Interest expense $ 2.0 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 14.3 Total interest $ 16.3 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Convertible Notes as of March 27, 2021 were $ 2.4 million and $ 21.6 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility On March 11, 2021, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $ 200.0 million to $ 250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement . The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $ 100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of March 27, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the three months ended March 27, 2021 was 2.5 %. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026 . Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $ 100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of March 27, 2021, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 20 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 2020 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 2.6 $ 2.1 Research and development 12.9 9.0 33.4 24.6 Selling, general, and administrative 11.4 8.1 34.0 17.5 Total $ 25.1 $ 17.9 $ 70.0 $ 44.2 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ ( 2.5 ) $ ( 1.8 ) $ ( 11.5 ) $ ( 4.5 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 2020 2021 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.3 $ 0.2 Research and development 7.2 3.3 16.4 5.8 Selling, general, and administrative 1.5 0.7 3.5 1.1 Total $ 8.8 $ 4.1 $ 20.2 $ 7.1 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the replaced share-based compensation plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 2,590,000 as of October 27, 2020. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. 21 Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan , subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure . The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our C ompany (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our C ompany . As a result of approval by our stockholders of our amended and restated 2019 Incentive Plan on October 27, 2020, no new awards will be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Outstanding as of June 2020 329,786 $ 69.78 Exercised ( 209,767 ) 68.73 Expired ( 53,561 ) 75.48 Outstanding and Exercisable as of March 2021 66,458 68.50 $ 4.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 26, 2021 of $ 136.91 .

On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award. Of the shares delivered, 338,428 shares valued at $ 26.9 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. 22 Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to certain of our employees. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 391,532 Granted 101,009 Performance adjustment 77,534 Delivered ( 208,275 ) Forfeited ( 14,773 ) Balance as of March 2021 347,027 $ 47.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 26, 2021 of $ 136.91 . 23 We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 20.2 million as of March 27, 2021, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2010 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. Generally the grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 333,848 Awarded 174,231 Performance adjustment 84,111 Released ( 201,835 ) Forfeited ( 64,344 ) Balance as of March 2021 326,011 $ 44.6 24 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 26, 2021 of $ 136.91 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 17.2 million as of March 27, 2021, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 135.33 per unit at March 27, 2021 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 11.6 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2020 789,113 Released ( 242,692 ) Forfeited ( 121,941 ) Balance as of March 2021 424,480 The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 45.9 million as of March 27, 2021, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 220,389 Weighted average purchase price $ 57.00 Cash received $ 12.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.3 13. Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. 25 The provision for income taxes of $ 10.4 million and $ 10.2 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 27, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 28, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The provision for income taxes of $ 16.4 million and $ 17.3 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 28, 2020, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 0.8 million during the nine months ended March 27, 2021, at $ 22.9 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 27, 2021 were $ 1.7 million; this balance decreased by $ 0.2 million compared to June 27, 2020, largely due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $ 3.1 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 2020 2021 2020 China $ 130.9 $ 122.1 $ 406.2 $ 437.1 Taiwan 101.5 42.3 268.1 164.0 Japan 67.5 128.1 258.9 340.8 Other 16.7 21.1 54.7 58.1 South Korea 8.5 13.1 20.0 51.0 United States 0.7 1.4 3.9 5.3 $ 325.8 $ 328.1 $ 1,011.8 $ 1,056.3 26 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 2020 2021 2020 IoT product applications $ 146.0 $ 72.6 $ 415.5 $ 249.4 PC product applications 98.4 78.9 270.4 228.3 Mobile product applications 81.4 176.6 325.9 578.6 $ 325.8 $ 328.1 $ 1,011.8 $ 1,056.3 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March March 2021 2020 2021 2020 Customer A 13 % * 12 % * Customer B 11 % 13 % 11 % 12 % Customer C * 21 % 16 % 17 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: March June 2021 2020 Customer A 15 % 18 % Customer B 12 % * Customer C * 21 % 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities During the first quarter and third quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated restructuring activities, which included severance costs for activities intended to gain synergies from our recent acquisitions. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2021 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 5.1 Cash payments ( 4.6 ) Balance as of March 2021 $ 0.5 27 During fiscal 2020, we initiated restructuring activities, some of which included severance costs which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities to align our cost structure consistent with our revenue levels and severance costs related to employees who transitioned with the sale of our assets of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Some of the activities relating to these restructurings are complete as of June 27, 2020. The remaining activities are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2021 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance as of June 2020 $ 6.1 Accruals 2.0 Cash payments ( 7.6 ) Balance as of March 2021 $ 0.5 17. Subsequent Events Effective April 1, 2021, the Sales Price Condition of our Convertible Notes had been met at the end of the preceding calendar quarter and holders of our notes became entitled to redeem their notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture during the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2021. As of May 3, 2021, $ 19.4 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes had been submitted for conversion, which is expected to occur during our fiscal fourth quarter through a combination of cash and common stock. 28 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2021 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to the following: our dependence on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; the risk that our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by heath epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which rapidly spread broadly in the U.S. and globally. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees worked from home since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. However, as the broad roll out of vaccines continues in many countries in which we operate, we anticipate employees will begin to return to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis. As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations, designed to monitor and assess the health of our employees, which include temperature checks and risk assessments, and requires all employees to wear face coverings and social distance while moving about in the office. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will moderate the overall severity and duration and are cautiously optimistic the most significant impact has passed. Certainly, our optimism could change if more infectious variants of COVID-19 become resistant to the existing vaccines. To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and at this time do not believe our business will be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to disrupt the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity. 29 Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, products which include smart devices with voice, speech and video solutions, wireless connectivity and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. The solutions we deliver either contain or consist of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, wireless- or video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, and, as applicable, customer-specific firmware and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio business. See below under “Divestitures”. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 30 Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. As of March 27, 2021, our purchase consideration was $444.0 million. The results of DisplayLink are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from August 1, 2020 through March 27, 2021. For further discussion of the DisplayLink acquisition, see Note 6 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from July 24, 2020 through March 27, 2021. For further discussion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition, see Note 6 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Divestitures In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement for cash consideration of $138.7 million and had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020. The gain on sale of this portion of a product line was $105.1 million. Investment In December 2020, we invested $5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a partnership which enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Business Combinations We have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill recognized in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach. The valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations. Other than the above item, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended March 27, 2021, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s 31 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 2 7 , 20 20 . Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March Nine Months Ended March 2021 2020 $ Change % Change 2021 2020 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 146.0 $ 72.6 $ 73.4 101.1 % $ 415.5 $ 249.4 $ 166.1 66.6 % PC product applications 98.4 78.9 19.5 24.7 % 270.4 228.3 42.1 18.4 % Mobile product applications 81.4 176.6 (95.2 ) (53.9 %) 325.9 578.6 (252.7 ) (43.7 %) Net revenue 325.8 328.1 (2.3 ) (0.7 %) 1,011.8 1,056.3 (44.5 ) (4.2 %) Gross margin 155.5 135.6 19.9 14.7 % 440.4 421.1 19.3 4.6 % Operating expenses: Research and development 77.5 75.8 1.7 2.2 % 235.7 238.8 (3.1 ) (1.3 %) Selling, general, and administrative 36.8 31.6 5.2 16.5 % 111.6 90.6 21.0 23.2 % Acquired intangibles amortization 8.7 2.9 5.8 200.0 % 24.1 8.8 15.3 173.9 % Restructuring costs 0.9 6.3 (5.4 ) (85.7 %) 7.1 26.2 (19.1 ) (72.9 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets — — — (34.2 ) — (34.2 ) 100.0 % Operating income 31.6 19.0 12.6 66.3 % 96.1 56.7 39.4 69.5 % Interest and other expense, net (7.0 ) (3.2 ) (3.8 ) (118.8 %) (17.7 ) (9.1 ) (8.6 ) (94.5 %) Income before provision for income taxes 24.6 15.8 8.8 55.7 % 78.4 47.6 30.8 64.7 % Provision for income taxes 10.4 10.2 0.2 2.0 % 16.4 17.3 (0.9 ) (5.2 %) Equity investment loss (0.4 ) (0.6 ) 0.2 33.3 % (1.4 ) (1.5 ) 0.1 6.7 % Net income $ 13.8 $ 5.0 $ 8.8 176.0 % $ 60.6 $ 28.8 $ 31.8 110.4 % Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Nine Months Ended Percentage Point March Increase/ March Increase/ 2021 2020 (Decrease) 2021 2020 (Decrease) IoT product applications 44.8 % 22.1 % 22.7 % 41.1 % 23.6 % 17.5 % PC product applications 30.2 % 24.0 % 6.2 % 26.7 % 21.6 % 5.1 % Mobile product applications 25.0 % 53.9 % (28.9 %) 32.2 % 54.8 % (22.6 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 47.7 % 41.3 % 6.4 % 43.5 % 39.9 % 3.6 % Operating expenses: Research and development 23.8 % 23.1 % 0.7 % 23.3 % 22.6 % 0.7 % Selling, general, and administrative 11.3 % 9.6 % 1.7 % 11.0 % 8.6 % 2.4 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.7 % 0.9 % 1.8 % 2.4 % 0.8 % 1.6 % Restructuring costs 0.3 % 1.9 % (1.6 %) 0.7 % 2.5 % (1.8 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % (3.4 %) 0.0 % (3.4 %) Operating income 9.7 % 5.8 % 3.9 % 9.5 % 5.4 % 4.1 % Interest and other expense, net (2.1 %) (1.0 %) (1.1 %) (1.7 %) (0.9 %) (0.8 %) Income before provision for income taxes 7.6 % 4.8 % 2.8 % 7.7 % 4.5 % 3.2 % Provision for income taxes 3.2 % 3.1 % 0.1 % 1.6 % 1.6 % 0.0 % Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.2 %) 0.1 % (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income 4.2 % 1.5 % 2.7 % 6.0 % 2.7 % 3.3 % 32 Net Revenue Net revenue was $325.8 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021, compared with $328.1 million for the three months ended March 28, 2020, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 0.7%. Of this net revenue, $146.0 million, or 44.8%, was from IoT product applications, and $98.4 million, or 30.2%, was from PC product applications, and $81.4 million, or 25.0%, was from Mobile product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended March 27, 2021 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 47%) as well as lower average selling prices due to product sales mix (which declined 13%) for Mobile product applications. The decline in unit sales in Mobile product applications was primarily due to the overall reduction in our display driver product applications and the divestiture of a portion of our TDDI product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Net revenue from IoT product applications, which includes products from both acquisitions that closed in July 2020, increased as a result of higher average selling prices for IoT product applications due to our product sales mix (which increased 72%) and an increase in units sold (which increased 17%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 34%) for PC product applications partially offset by lower average selling prices due to our product sales mix (which decreased 7%). Net revenue was $1,011.8 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, compared with $1,056.3 million for the nine months ended March 28, 2020, a decrease of $44.5 million, or 4.2%. Of this net revenue, $415.5 million, or 41.1%, was from IoT product applications, and $270.4 million, or 26.7%, was from PC product applications, and $325.9 million, or 32.2%, was from Mobile product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 was attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 35%) as well as lower average selling prices due to product sales mix (a decline of 13%) for Mobile product applications. The decline in unit sales in Mobile product applications was primarily due to the divestiture of a portion of our TDDI product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Net revenue from IoT product applications, which includes products from both acquisitions that closed in July 2020, increased as a result of higher average selling prices for IoT product applications due to our product sales mix (which increased 47%) and an increase in units sold (which increased 13%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 18%) for PC product applications. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 47.7%, or $155.5 million, for the three months ended March 27, 2021, compared with 41.3%, or $135.6 million, for the three months ended March 28, 2020. The 640 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended March 27, 2021, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and product cost reductions, partially offset by a $10.8 million increase in amortization for amortizable intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of DisplayLink and the Broadcom Business Acquisition and $4.3 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the DisplayLink acquisition. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 43.5%, or $440.4 million, for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, compared with 39.9%, or $421.1 million, for the nine months ended March 28, 2020. The 360 basis point increase in gross margin for the nine months ended March 28, 2020, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and product cost reductions, partially offset by a $28.9 million increase in amortization for amortizable intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of DisplayLink and the Broadcom Business Acquisition and $26.0 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the DisplayLink acquisition. We continuously introduce new product solutions, that may have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses increased slightly to $77.5 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021, compared with $75.8 million for the three months ended March 28, 2020. A majority of expenses have declined from the three months ended March 28, 2020 to the three months ended March 27, 2021, as a result of a reduction in average headcount. However, the declines in other expenses have been offset by acquisition related product development services and phantom stock expense. Research and development expenses decreased $3.1 million to $235.7 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, compared with the nine months ended March 28, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses reflected a net $9.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which was due to a reduction in average headcount for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 as compared to the nine months ended March 28, 2020, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs, partially 33 offset by increased headcount as a result of recent acquisitions; a $5.0 million decrease in software license and maintenance costs; a $3.7 million decrease due to acquired in-process research and development recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020; a $ 2. 6 million decrease in travel related costs and a $ 1.5 million decrease in facilities and infrastructure costs; partially offset by a n $8.7 million increase in stock based compensation (primarily related to phantom stock expense ) , an increase of $ 5.8 million in project related costs and a $ 2.6 million increase in intellectual property amortization . Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $5.2 million to $36.8 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021, compared with the three months ended March 28, 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $3.4 million increase in stock based compensation costs which were incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2020 and the first nine months of fiscal 2021, as well as a $2.1 million increase in personnel and related costs due to an increase in headcount related to recent acquisitions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $21.0 million to $111.6 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, compared with the nine months ended March 28, 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $16.6 million increase in stock based compensation costs which were incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2020 and the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and a $3.9 million increase in personnel and related costs due to an increase in headcount related to recent acquisitions. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $7.1 million in the nine months ended March 27, 2021 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs. Restructuring activities commenced in each of fiscal 2020 and the first nine months of fiscal 2021 are all expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Gain on sale of audio technology assets . Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio products. See Note 6 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net increased $3.8 million to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021, as compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended March 28, 2020. The increase in interest and other expense, net is primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances through most of the quarter and lower interest rates as well as higher interest expense on our debt due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit and our new Senior Notes issued during the quarter. Interest and other expense, net increased $8.6 million to $17.7 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021, as compared to $9.1 million for the nine months ended March 28, 2020. The increase in interest and other expense, net is primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances during most of the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and lower interest rates, as well as higher interest expense on our debt due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit and our new Senior Notes issued during the quarter . Provision for Income Taxes. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 27, 2021. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. 34 The provision for income taxes of $ 10.4 million and $1 0. 2 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 , respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 27, 2021 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 28, 2020 , diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits . The provision for income taxes of $16.4 million and $17.3 million for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 28, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 28, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $756.2 million as of March 27, 2021, compared with $763.4 million as of June 27, 2020, representing a decrease of $7.2 million. The decrease primarily reflected $626.5 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, a $100.0 million payment on line of credit borrowings, $27.0 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, market stock units and performance stock units, and $15.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $400.0 million of proceeds from issuance of debt, $95.8 million of proceeds from maturities of investments, $214.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $34.2 million of proceeds from the sale of audio technology assets and $26.9 of proceeds from issuance of shares. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of March 27, 2021, $257.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes to repatriate certain of these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 generated $214.3 million compared with $168.3 million net cash generated during the nine months ended March 28, 2020. For the nine months ended March 27, 2021, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $126.3 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $27.4 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $65.8 million decrease in inventories and a $37.9 increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $31.3 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a $19.3 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, a $11.8 million decrease in income taxes payable, and a $7.9 increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. From June 27, 2020 to March 27, 2021, our days sales outstanding increased slightly from 63 days to 65 days. Our annual inventory turns increased from six to nine over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended March 27, 2021 primarily consisted of $626.5 million used for the acquisition of businesses and $15.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $95.8 million in proceeds from maturities of investments and $34.2 million of proceeds from sale of audio technology assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 was $294.0 million compared with $9.6 million cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 28, 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 27, 2021 consisted of $400.0 million of proceeds from issuance of debt and $26.9 of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by primarily a $100.0 million payment on line of credit borrowings and $27.0 million used for payroll taxes on RSUs, MSUs and PSUs. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of March 27, 2021, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through March 27, 2021, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the three months ended March 27, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of March 27, 2021, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $177.4 million. 35 Senior Debt On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: Year Price 2024 102 % 2025 101 % 2026 and thereafter 100 % In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us. The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors’ future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Convertible Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, of $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. 36 The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances, including (1) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter or (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. This criteria has been met as of March 27, 2021. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Convertible Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. On March 11, 2021, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of March 27, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the three months ended March 27, 2021 was 2.5%. 37 Borrowings under t he revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11 , 202 6. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months . Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of March 27, 2021, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the Company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including the DisplayLink acquisition, the Broadcom Business Acquisition, and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on variants of COVID-19, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 38 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 27, 2021 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Year 2025 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 5.6 $ 543.7 $ 16.0 $ 16.0 $ 16.0 $ 464.0 $ 1,061.3 Leases 2.7 10.1 6.3 4.8 4.0 13.4 41.3 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 44.0 67.6 44.9 4.6 — — 161.1 Transition tax payable (3) — 0.9 1.8 2.4 3.0 — 8.1 Total $ 52.3 $ 622.3 $ 69.0 $ 27.8 $ 23.0 $ 477.4 $ 1,271.8 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the remaining balance of the one-time transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $22.9 million. As of March 27, 2021, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 39 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March 27, 2021, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. Our assessment excluded DisplayLink which was acquired on July 31, 2020. DisplayLink had net revenues of approximately $78.9 million and total tangible assets of approximately $60.2 million, which are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended March 27, 2021. We are currently assessing the control environment of this acquired business. DisplayLink sales constitute approximately 7.8% of our sales for the nine-month period covered by this Report, their tangible assets constitute approximately 4.7% of our tangible assets as of the end of such period and their total liabilities constitute approximately 3.6% of our total liabilities. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. During the integration period, management is developing additional controls to ensure the financial information provided by DisplayLink is complete and accurate in all material respects. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended March 27, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 40 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2021. As of March 27, 2021, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $177.4 million. During the three-month period ended March 27, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. 41 ITEM 6.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2021 and 2020 are 52-week periods ending June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week and 26-week periods ended December 26, 2020, and December 28, 2019, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents as of December 26, 2020 included bank deposits with a carrying value of $ 0.9 million, which approximates fair value, and as of June 27, 2020 they included money market accounts with a carrying value of $ 521.1 million, which approximates fair value, and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Short-term investments consist of bank deposits with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased. All of our short-term investments are classified as investments recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.0 million in the three and six months ended December 26, 2020, respectively, and net losses of $ 0.4 million and net gains of $ 0.1 million in the three and six months ended December 28, 2019, respectively. 7 Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and 8 other current assets . In limited circumstances , we enter into volume - based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement s to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 0.2 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2020 and $ 0.4 million as of June 27, 2020. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 5.4 million and $ 29.2 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2020, and $ 3.2 million and $ 25.8 million, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the six months ended December 26, 2020, and the six months ended December 28, 2019, we recognized $ 1.1 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of December 26, 2020, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3.

We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 179,491 and 775,347 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, and 502,657 and 1,074,778 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were 9 outstanding during the six months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 , respectively . These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Fair Value Our carrying values of cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. The convertible notes are recorded at amortized cost of $ 496.1 million and $ 486.6 million as of December 26, 2020 and June 27, 2020, respectively and the fair value of the convertible notes was approximately $ 676.1 and $ 542.5 million as of December 26, 2020 and June 27, 2020, respectively, based on the last trading price of the convertible notes for the periods presented. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): December June 2020 2020 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 43.6 $ 53.6 Finished goods 29.5 48.4 $ 73.1 $ 102.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 6 . Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 % of equity interest in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology, for $ 305 million in cash adjusted for (i) estimated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the closing (ii) estimated indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the closing, (iii) unpaid portion as of the closing of certain transaction expenses incurred by DisplayLink, and (iv) the amount that the estimated working capital of DisplayLink exceeds or falls short, respectively, of a certain specified target working capital set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with $ 3.1 million of the purchase price held in escrow accounts for adjustments after closing and to secure the Seller Parties’ indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 , or the DisplayLink Closing Date, whereupon we obtained high-performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at December 26, 2020, is preliminary and subject to change and has been based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of intangible assets acquired and related deferred income taxes. The Company 10 expects to continue to obtain information for the purpose of determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date throughout the remainder of the measurement period . The adjusted purchase price paid for DisplayLink was $ 442.8 million. The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.9 Short-term investments 94.0 Accounts receivable, net 7.1 Inventory 33.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 9.1 Property and equipment 6.8 Intangible assets 193.0 Right-of-use lease asset 20.0 Non-current other assets 0.6 Total identifiable assets acquired 404.6 Accounts payable ( 5.2 ) Other accrued liabilities ( 9.9 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 18.2 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 31.8 ) Total liabilities ( 66.8 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 337.8 Goodwill 105.0 Net assets acquired $ 442.8 During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments of $ 2.3 million to goodwill comprising of increases of $ 2.3 million in prepaid expenses and $ 0.4 million in other long-term liabilities for a net increase of $ 1.9 million to the fair value of other acquired net tangible assets. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 3.0 $ 82.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 3.0 54.0 In process research and development N/A 51.0 Trade names 4.0 3.0 Licensed technology 2.5 3.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 193.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 11.0% to 11.5%. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up 11 period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions . In-process research and development consists of a next generation docking and video interface products for the IoT market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in early fiscal 2023. The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DisplayLink as of the DisplayLink Closing Date. As of December 26, 2020, none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DisplayLink acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DisplayLink. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 45.0 million of revenue from DisplayLink from the DisplayLink Closing Date through December 26, 2020. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DisplayLink as we integrated a substantial portion of DisplayLink into our ongoing operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 . The following unaudited pro forma financial information (in millions, except per share data) presents the combined results of operations for us and DisplayLink as if the DisplayLink acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the actual operating results that would have been recorded had the DisplayLink acquisition actually taken place on June 30, 2019 and should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated operating results. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma financial results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits from the DisplayLink acquisition. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2020 (1) 2019 2020 (1) 2019 Revenue $ 357.6 $ 414.1 $ 693.3 $ 779.1 Net income/(loss) 68.5 ( 10.6 ) 48.4 ( 6.3 ) (1) Includes results of Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income/(loss) included adjustments for historical amortization expense, the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, transaction costs and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were an increase to net income/(loss) of $ 6.9 million and a decrease of net income/(loss) of $ 9.7 million, respectively. The total pro forma adjustments for the six months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were an increase to net income/(loss) of $ 8.0 million and a decrease of net income/(loss) of $ 18.4 million, respectively. Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business On July 2, 2020 , we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $ 250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020 , or the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years . We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business . The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date is preliminary and was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. 12 The following table summarizes the adjusted purchase price paid for the Broadcom Business Acquisition (in millions): Cash $ 250.1 Adjustments to consideration transferred, net 1.5 Roadmap products - estimated cost of development ( 25.0 ) $ 226.6 We entered into a derivative and roadmap product agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Broadcom. The derivative and roadmap product agreement includes the purchase of derivative and roadmap product development services to be performed by Broadcom. We estimated the value of the development services to be approximately $ 25.0 million, accounted for it separate from the business combination, and included $ 10.0 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $ 15.0 million ($ 10.8 million after amortization as of December 26, 2020) in non-current other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The estimated value of the development services is amortizing over the period of time estimated to complete the development or approximately thirty months. The amortization of the estimated cost of development is included in research and development in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In addition, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees and Broadcom agreed to make cash payments to transferred employees as incentive to accept employment offers from our company. We determined $ 3.5 million of value related to these arrangements should be included as consideration transferred, which was partially offset by $ 2.0 million of cash payments to transferred employees as a reduction of consideration transferred. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Property and equipment $ 1.0 Acquired intangible assets 123.0 Total identifiable assets acquired 124.0 Liabilities assumed ( 0.2 ) Goodwill 102.8 Net assets acquired $ 226.6 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which is 2.2 % for order backlog and 13.0 % for the rest of the intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimate of the intangible assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 6.0 $ 93.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 6.0 18.0 Order backlog 0.5 12.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 123.0 13 The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Broadcom Business assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. As of December 26, 2020, all of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Broadcom Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Broadcom. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 39.4 million of revenue from the Broadcom Business Acquisition from the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date through December 26, 2020. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Broadcom Business Acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition into our ongoing operations during the quarter . We determined it is impractical to include pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information for the Broadcom Business Acquisition as the business was part of Broadcom and did not have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate. Divestiture In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction, licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $ 35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $ 34.2 million. Investment In December 2020, we invested $ 5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a partnership which enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. 7. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets (in millions): December 2020 June 2020 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.4 $ 138.6 $ ( 87.7 ) $ 50.9 $ 138.6 $ ( 76.5 ) $ 62.1 Customer relationships 4.2 125.5 ( 47.6 ) 77.9 81.8 ( 61.4 ) 20.4 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 93.0 ( 6.5 ) 86.5 — — — Video interface technology 3.0 82.0 ( 11.4 ) 70.6 — — — Display driver technology 7.0 20.4 ( 16.0 ) 4.4 164.0 ( 158.2 ) 5.8 Backlog 0.5 12.0 ( 10.0 ) 2.0 — — — Licensed technology and other 4.1 13.0 ( 6.8 ) 6.2 7.7 ( 5.5 ) 2.2 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 2.9 ) 1.5 4.4 ( 2.6 ) 1.8 Tradename 5.1 4.8 ( 1.2 ) 3.6 1.8 ( 0.7 ) 1.1 In process research and development N/A 51.0 — 51.0 — — — Acquired intangibles totals 5.1 $ 544.7 $ ( 190.1 ) $ 354.6 $ 398.3 $ ( 304.9 ) $ 93.4 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 31.6 million and $ 11.1 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, and $ 57.0 million and $ 29.3 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. During the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, $ 22.9 million and $ 8.2 million, respectively, and $ 41.6 million and $ 23.5 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. 14 The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of December 26, 2020 (in millions): Remainder of 2021 $ 53.1 2022 99.0 2023 86.1 2024 25.9 2025 19.0 Thereafter 20.5 To be determined 51.0 Future amortization $ 354.6 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Changes in our goodwill balance for the six months ended December 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Beginning balance $ 360.8 Acquisition activity 207.8 Ending balance $ 568.6 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2029 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the six months ended December 26, 2020, we recorded approximately $ 5.0 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of December 26, 2020, the components of leases and lease costs are as follows (in millions): December June 2020 2020 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 37.2 $ 21.0 Operating lease liabilities $ 10.5 $ 6.5 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 28.9 14.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 39.4 $ 21.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended December 2020 2019 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 3.9 $ 4.7 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 21.7 1.5 15 As of December 26, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term is 6.2 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.02 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2021 $ 6.0 2022 10.2 2023 6.3 2024 4.8 2025 3.9 Thereafter 13.2 Total future minimum operating lease payments 44.4 Less: interest ( 5.0 ) Total lease liabilities $ 39.4 9. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December June 2020 2020 Customer obligations $ 34.6 $ 29.0 Inventory obligations 26.9 27.9 Operating lease liabilities 10.5 6.5 Other 25.4 27.6 $ 97.4 $ 91.0 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December June 2020 2020 Operating lease liabilities, long-term $ 28.9 $ 14.6 Deferred tax liability 23.9 — Income taxes payable, long-term 16.0 16.4 Other 13.8 13.0 $ 82.6 $ 44.0 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. 16 Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 11. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances, including (1) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter or (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. This criteria has not been met as of December 26, 2020. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . 17 The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the six months ended December 26, 2020, were as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended December 2020 Interest expense $ 1.3 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 9.5 Total interest $ 10.8 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of December 26, 2020 were $ 2.9 million and $ 26.0 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders, related to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration cost and expenses to 30 % from 15 % of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75 :1.00 from 3.50 :1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5 :00:1.00 from 3.75 :1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments . The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 26, 2020, there was a $ 100.0 million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the three months ended December 26, 2020 was 2.73 %. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 2.3 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the Administrative Agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. 18 Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. As of December 26, 2020, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2020 2019 2020 2019 Cost of revenue $ 1.0 $ 0.6 $ 1.8 $ 1.3 Research and development 9.5 8.1 20.5 15.6 Selling, general, and administrative 12.9 6.4 22.6 9.4 Total $ 23.4 $ 15.1 $ 44.9 $ 26.3 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ ( 5.4 ) $ ( 1.8 ) $ ( 9.0 ) $ ( 2.7 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2020 2019 2020 2019 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 Research and development 3.4 2.5 9.2 2.5 Selling, general, and administrative 0.7 0.4 2.0 0.4 Total $ 4.2 $ 3.0 $ 11.4 $ 3.0 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the replaced share-based compensation plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 2,590,000 as of October 27, 2020. The 19 2019 ESPP authorizes the C ompany to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the C ompany through the purchase of stock at a discount , with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. As a result of approval by our stockholders of our amended and restated 2019 Incentive Plan on October 27, 2020, no new awards will be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Outstanding as of June 2020 329,786 $ 69.78 Exercised ( 76,060 ) 61.73 Expired ( 53,561 ) 75.48 Outstanding and Exercisable as of December 2020 200,165 71.31 $ 3.1 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 24, 2020 of $ 86.15 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. Restricted Stock Units RSU activity was as follows: Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 1,360,324 Granted 768,662 Delivered ( 510,713 ) Forfeited ( 152,363 ) Balance as of December 2020 1,465,910 $ 126.3 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 24, 2020 of $ 86.15 . Of the shares delivered, 151,595 shares valued at $ 11.8 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. 20 Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to certain of our employees. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 391,532 Granted 101,009 Performance adjustment 77,534 Delivered ( 208,275 ) Forfeited ( 14,773 ) Balance as of December 2020 347,027 $ 29.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 24, 2020 of $ 86.15 . 21 We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 23.8 million as of December 26, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.5 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 333,848 Awarded 174,231 Performance adjustment 84,111 Released ( 201,835 ) Forfeited ( 48,671 ) Balance as of December 2020 341,684 $ 29.4 22 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 24, 2020 of $ 86.15 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 18.3 million as of December 26, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 81.31 per unit at December 26, 2020 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 2.8 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Phantom Stock Units Outstanding Balance as of June 2020 789,113 Released ( 242,692 ) Forfeited ( 100,709 ) Balance as of December 2020 445,712 The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 33.5 million as of December 26, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the six months ended December 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 134,601 Weighted average purchase price $ 48.67 Cash received $ 6.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 4.6 13. Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the six months ended December 26, 2020. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. 23 The provision for income taxes of $ 2.4 million and $ 12.0 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and income taxed at lower tax rates. The provision for income taxes of $ 6.0 million and $ 7.1 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 28, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of withholding taxes and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and income taxed at lower tax rates. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions remained unchanged during the six months ended December 26, 2020, at $ 22.1 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2020 were $ 1.7 million; this balance decreased by $ 0.3 million compared to June 27, 2020, largely due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $ 3.2 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Mobile product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2020 2019 2020 2019 China $ 144.1 $ 138.2 $ 275.3 $ 315.0 Taiwan 94.8 56.4 166.6 121.6 Japan 88.3 149.5 191.4 212.7 Other 22.0 20.5 38.0 37.0 South Korea 6.5 21.6 11.5 38.0 United States 1.9 2.1 3.2 3.9 $ 357.6 $ 388.3 $ 686.0 $ 728.2 24 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2020 2019 2020 2019 IoT product applications $ 155.1 $ 89.0 $ 269.5 $ 176.8 PC product applications 91.5 81.6 172.0 149.4 Mobile product applications 111.0 217.7 244.5 402.0 $ 357.6 $ 388.3 $ 686.0 $ 728.2 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December December 2020 2019 2020 2019 Customer A 18 % 21 % 20 % 15 % Customer B * 13 % 11 % 11 % Customer C 13 % * 11 % * ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: December June 2020 2020 Customer A 17 % 21 % Customer B 13 % 18 % 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated restructuring activities, which included severance costs for activities intended to gain synergies from our recent acquisitions. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2021 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 4.1 Cash payments ( 3.7 ) Balance as of December 2020 $ 0.4 25 During fiscal 2020, we initiated restructuring activities, some of which included severance costs which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities to align our cost structure consistent with our revenue levels and severance costs related to employees who transitioned with the sale of our assets of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Some of the activities relating to these restructurings are complete as of June 27, 2020. The remaining activities are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2021 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance as of June 2020 $ 6.1 Accruals 2.0 Cash payments ( 7.4 ) Balance as of December 2020 $ 0.7 26 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2020 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to following: our dependence on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; the risk that our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by heath epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to rapidly spread broadly in the U.S. and globally. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate governments took rapid and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or have missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees are able to work from home to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. For those employees that are comfortable returning to an office work environment, we implemented various return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations, to monitor and assess the health of our employees, including temperature checks and risk assessments, and further require all employees that do work in the office to wear face coverings and social distance while in communal locations in the office. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we expect that it will continue to weigh on our business and consolidated results of operations in the near term and may further impact our financial condition (including liquidity) in the future. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to anticipate. While we have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact COVID-19 will have on our future results due to numerous uncertainties, including the effectiveness of recently approved vaccines against the virus and its mutations, timing and effectiveness of the broad deployment of vaccines to mitigate or stem the spread of the virus, severity of the disease, the duration of the current outbreak, the severity and duration of future surges of the outbreak, further containment actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and suppliers and other factors. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition, and may take actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or 27 appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences . We are optimistic that the recent changes in the United States to a more science-based, disciplined, and deliberate approach to addressing the virus and the ancillary effects of steps taken to slow the spread may temper the potential mid- to longer-term negative economic impact. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, products which include smart devices with voice, speech and video solutions, wireless connectivity and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. The solutions we deliver either contain or consist of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, wireless- or video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, and, as applicable, customer-specific firmware and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 28 Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio business. See below under “Divestiture s ”. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. As of December 26, 2020, our preliminary purchase consideration was $442.8 million, subject to certain additional post-closing adjustments. The results of DisplayLink are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from August 1, 2020 through December 26, 2020. For further discussion of the DisplayLink acquisition, see Note 6 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from July 24, 2020 through December 26, 2020. For further discussion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition, see Note 6 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Divestitures In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement for cash consideration of $138.7 million and had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020. The gain on sale of this business component was $105.1 million. In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million. Investment In December 2020, we invested $5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a partnership which enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Business Combinations We have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill recognized in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach. 29 The valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations. Other than the above item, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended December 26, 2020, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended December Six Months Ended December 2020 2019 $ Change % Change 2020 2019 $ Change % Change IoT product applications $ 155.1 $ 89.0 $ 66.1 74.3 % $ 269.5 $ 176.8 $ 92.7 52.4 % PC product applications 91.5 81.6 9.9 12.1 % 172.0 149.4 22.6 15.1 % Mobile product applications 111.0 217.7 (106.7 ) (49.0 %) 244.5 402.0 (157.5 ) (39.2 %) Net revenue 357.6 388.3 (30.7 ) (7.9 %) 686.0 728.2 (42.2 ) (5.8 %) Gross margin 150.4 159.3 (8.9 ) (5.6 %) 284.9 285.5 (0.6 ) (0.2 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 77.3 77.0 0.3 0.4 % 158.2 163.0 (4.8 ) (2.9 %) Selling, general, and administrative 39.5 31.5 8.0 25.4 % 74.8 59.0 15.8 26.8 % Acquired intangibles amortization 8.7 3.0 5.7 190.0 % 15.4 5.9 9.5 161.0 % Restructuring costs 0.6 13.3 (12.7 ) (95.5 %) 6.2 19.9 (13.7 ) (68.8 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets (34.2 ) — (34.2 ) 100.0 % (34.2 ) — (34.2 ) 100.0 % Operating income 58.5 34.5 24.0 69.6 % 64.5 37.7 26.8 71.1 % Interest and other expense, net (6.0 ) (2.3 ) (3.7 ) (160.9 %) (10.7 ) (5.9 ) (4.8 ) (81.4 %) Income before provision for income taxes 52.5 32.2 20.3 63.0 % 53.8 31.8 22.0 69.2 % Provision for income taxes 2.4 12.0 (9.6 ) (80.0 %) 6.0 7.1 (1.1 ) (15.5 %) Equity investment loss (0.5 ) (0.4 ) (0.1 ) (25.0 %) (1.0 ) (0.9 ) (0.1 ) (11.1 %) Net income $ 49.6 $ 19.8 $ 29.8 150.5 % $ 46.8 $ 23.8 $ 23.0 96.6 % 30 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Six Months Ended Percentage Point December Increase/ December Increase/ 2020 2019 (Decrease) 2020 2019 (Decrease) IoT product applications 43.4 % 22.9 % 20.5 % 39.3 % 24.3 % 15.0 % PC product applications 25.6 % 21.0 % 4.6 % 25.1 % 20.5 % 4.6 % Mobile product applications 31.0 % 56.1 % (25.1 %) 35.6 % 55.2 % (19.6 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 42.1 % 41.0 % 1.1 % 41.5 % 39.2 % 2.3 % Operating expenses: Research and development 21.6 % 19.8 % 1.8 % 23.1 % 22.4 % 0.7 % Selling, general, and administrative 11.0 % 8.1 % 2.9 % 10.9 % 8.1 % 2.8 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.4 % 0.8 % 1.6 % 2.2 % 0.8 % 1.4 % Restructuring costs 0.2 % 3.4 % (3.2 %) 0.9 % 2.7 % (1.8 %) Gain on sale of audio technology assets (9.6 %) 0.0 % (9.6 %) (5.0 %) 0.0 % (5.0 %) Operating income 16.4 % 8.9 % 7.5 % 9.4 % 5.2 % 4.2 % Interest and other expense, net (1.7 %) (0.6 %) (1.1 %) (1.6 %) (0.8 %) (0.8 %) Income before provision for income taxes 14.7 % 8.3 % 6.4 % 7.8 % 4.4 % 3.4 % Provision for income taxes 0.7 % 3.1 % (2.4 %) 0.9 % 1.0 % (0.1 %) Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income 13.9 % 5.1 % 8.8 % 6.8 % 3.3 % 3.5 % Net Revenue Net revenue was $357.6 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, compared with $388.3 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019, a decrease of $30.7 million, or 7.9%. Of this net revenue, $155.1 million, or 43.4%, was from IoT product applications, and $91.5 million, or 25.6%, was from PC product applications, and $111.0 million, or 31.0%, was from Mobile product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended December 26, 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 36%) as well as lower average selling prices due to product sales mix (which declined 20%) for Mobile product applications. The decline in unit sales in Mobile product applications was primarily due to the divestiture of our TDDI business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Net revenue from IoT product applications, which includes products from both acquisitions that closed in July 2020, increased as a result of higher average selling prices for IoT product applications due to our product sales mix (which increased 48%) and an increase in units sold (which increased 18%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 12%) for PC product applications. Net revenue was $686.0 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020, compared with $728.2 million for the six months ended December 28, 2019, a decrease of $42.2 million, or 5.8%. Of this net revenue, $269.5 million, or 39.3%, was from IoT product applications, and $172.0 million, or 25.1%, was from PC product applications, and $244.5 million, or 35.6%, was from Mobile product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended December 26, 2020 was attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 30%) as well as lower average selling prices (a decline of 13%) for Mobile product applications. The decline in unit sales in Mobile product applications was primarily due to the divestiture of our TDDI business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Net revenue from IoT product applications, which includes products from both acquisitions that closed in July 2020, increased as a result of higher average selling prices for IoT product applications due to our product sales mix (which increased 36%) and an increase in units sold (which increased 12%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 10%) for PC product applications as well as slightly higher average selling prices. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 42.1%, or $150.4 million, for the three months ended December 26, 2020, compared with 41.0%, or $159.3 million, for the three months ended December 28, 2019. The 110 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended December 26, 2020, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and product cost reductions, partially 31 offset by a $ 20.5 million in crease in amortization for amortizable intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of DisplayLink and the Broadcom Business Acquisition and $ 11.9 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the DisplayLink a cquisition . Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 41.5%, or $284.9 million, for the six months ended December 26, 2020, compared with 39.2%, or $285.5 million, for the six months ended December 28, 2019. The 230 basis point increase in gross margin for the six months ended December 28, 2019, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and product cost reductions, partially offset by a $27.7 million increase in amortization for amortizable intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of DisplayLink and the Broadcom Business Acquisition and $21.7 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the DisplayLink acquisition We continuously introduce new product solutions, that may have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses remained flat at $77.3 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, compared with $77.0 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019. A majority of expenses have declined from the three months ended December 28, 2019 to the three months ended December 26, 2020, as a result of a reduction in average headcount. However, the declines in other expenses have been offset by acquisition related product development services. Research and development expenses decreased $4.8 million to $158.2 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020, compared with the six months ended December 28, 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses reflected a net $3.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which was due to a reduction in average headcount for the six months ended December 26, 2020 as compared to the six months ended December 28, 2019, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs, partially offset by increased headcount as a result of recent acquisitions; a $3.7 million decrease due to acquired in-process research and development recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020; a $2.0 million decrease in travel related costs; a $1.6 million decrease in software license and maintenance costs; and a $1.3 million decrease in facilities and infrastructure costs; partially offset by an increase of $3.5 million in project related costs and a $3.0 million increase in intellectual property amortization. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $8.0 million to $39.5 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, compared with the three months ended December 28, 2019. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $6.5 million increase in stock based compensation costs which were incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021, as well as a $1.4 million increase in legal and accounting fees related to recent acquisitions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $15.8 million to $74.8 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020, compared with the six months ended December 28, 2019. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $13.2 million increase in stock based compensation costs which were incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021, as well as a $1.1 million increase in foreign exchange losses. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $6.2 million in the six months ended December 26, 2020 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs. Restructuring activities commenced in each of fiscal 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021 and are all expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Gain on sale of audio technology assets . Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio business. See Note 6 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net increased $3.7 million to $6.0 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, as compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019. The increase in interest and other expense, net is primarily 32 due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances and interest rates and higher interest expense on our debt due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit. I nterest and other expense, net in c reased $ 4.8 million to $ 10.7 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020 , as compared to $ 5.9 million for the six months ended December 28, 2019 . The in c rease in interest and other expense, net is primarily due to a de crease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances and interest rates and higher interest expense on our debt due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit . Provision for Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the three and six months ended December 26, 2020. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is based on our estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, adjusted for discrete items required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate can be subject to volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast annual income before provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes of $2.4 million and $12.0 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and income taxed at lower tax rates. The provision for income taxes of $6.0 million and $7.1 million for the six months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 28, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes and GILTI partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and income taxed at lower tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $309.9 million as of December 26, 2020, compared with $763.4 million as of June 27, 2020, representing a decrease of $453.5 million. The decrease primarily reflected $623.0 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, $25.8 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, market stock units and performance stock units, and $12.2 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $88.0 million of proceeds from maturities of investments, $77.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $34.2 million of proceeds from sale of audio technology assets and $11.2 of proceeds from issuance of shares. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of December 26, 2020, $198.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes to repatriate certain of these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the six months ended December 26, 2020 generated $77.9 million compared with $120.0 million net cash generated during the six months ended December 28, 2019. For the six months ended December 26, 2020, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $75.2 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $44.1 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $46.9 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a $24.6 million decrease in accrued compensation, $15.3 million decrease in income taxes payable and a $11.9 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $62.0 million decrease in inventories. From June 27, 2020 to December 26, 2020, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 63 days. Our annual inventory turns increased from six to nine over the same time period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 26, 2020 primarily consisted of $623.0 million used for the acquisition of businesses and $12.2 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $88.0 million in proceeds from maturities of investments and $34.2 million of proceeds from sale of audio technology assets. 33 Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 26, 2020 was $14.6 million compared with $12.2 million for the six months ended December 28, 2019 . Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 26, 2020 consisted of $25.8 million used for payroll taxes on RSUs , MSUs and PSUs , partially offset by $1 1.2 of proceeds from issuance of shares . Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 26, 2020, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through December 26, 2020, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the three months ended December 26, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of December 26, 2020, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $177.4 million. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC and the assets of Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.’s multimedia solutions business. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances, including (1) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter or (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal 34 to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration cost and expenses to 30% from 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75:1.00 from 3.50:1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5:00:1.00 from 3.75:1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s existing convertible senior notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments. As of December 26, 2020, there was $100.0 million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the three months ended December 26, 2020 was 2.73%. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions based on specific covenant calculations. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. 35 $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the Company , in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Although consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including the DisplayLink acquisition, the Broadcom Business Acquisition, and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. On April 2, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million under the Credit Agreement in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility out of an abundance of caution as a result of the ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global markets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of recently approved vaccines including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Year 2025 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 2.6 $ 627.7 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 630.3 Leases 6.0 10.2 6.3 4.8 3.9 13.2 44.4 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 34.6 8.1 8.8 1.4 — — 52.9 Transition tax payable (3) — 0.9 1.8 2.4 3.0 — 8.1 Total $ 43.2 $ 646.9 $ 16.9 $ 8.6 $ 6.9 $ 13.2 $ 735.7 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the remaining balance of the one-time transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $22.1 million. As of December 26, 2020, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 36 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December 26, 2020, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. Our assessment excluded DisplayLink which was acquired on July 31, 2020. DisplayLink had net revenues of approximately $45.0 million and total tangible assets of approximately $59.0 million, which are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended December 26, 2020. We are currently assessing the control environment of this acquired business. DisplayLink sales constitute approximately 6.6% of our sales for the six-month period covered by this Report, their tangible assets constitute approximately 6.8% of our tangible assets as of the end of such period and their total liabilities constitute approximately 6.3% of our total liabilities. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. During the integration period, management is developing additional controls to ensure the financial information provided by DisplayLink is complete and accurate in all material respects. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended December 26, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 37 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2021. As of December 26, 2020, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $177.4 million. During the three-month period ended December 26, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. 38 ITEM 6.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2021 and 2020 are 52-week periods ending June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week periods ended September 26, 2020, and September 28, 2019. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash equivalents as of September 26, 2020 included bank deposits with a carrying value of $ 0.9 million, which approximates fair value, and as of June 27, 2020 they included money market accounts with a carrying value of $ 521.1 million, which approximates fair value, and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Short-term investments comprise deposits held with banks with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased. All of our short-term investments are classified as investments recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $ 0.1 million in the three months ended September 26, 2020 and net gains of $ 0.4 million in the three months ended September 28, 2019. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or 7 ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our c ondensed c onsolidated b alance s heet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our c ondensed c onsolidated b alance s heet, and a non-current portion , included within other long-term liabilities on our c ondensed c onsolidated b alance s heet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue using Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. 8 Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material bad debt charges recorded on accounts receivable. There were $ 0.5 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 26, 2020 and $ 0.4 million as of June 27, 2020. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 5.9 million and $ 30.0 million, respectively, as of September 26, 2020, and $ 3.2 million and $ 25.8 million, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the three months ended September 26, 2020, and the three months ended September 28, 2019, we recognized $ 0.6 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities, which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of September 26, 2020, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and include these costs in cost of revenue. We account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income/(loss) $ ( 2.8 ) $ 4.0 Denominator: Shares, basic 34.2 33.0 Effect of dilutive share-based awards - 0.6 Shares, diluted 34.2 33.6 Net income/(loss) per share: Basic $ ( 0.08 ) $ 0.12 Diluted $ ( 0.08 ) $ 0.12 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 1,827,212 and 1,340,521 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 9 4. Fair Value Our carrying values of cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value. The fair value of our $ 525.0 million principal amount of 0.50% convertible notes due 2022 is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of the convertible notes as of September 26, 2020 and June 27, 2020 was approximately $ 639.5 and $ 542.5 million, respectively, based on the last trading price of the convertible notes for the periods presented. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): September June 2020 2020 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 66.2 $ 53.6 Finished goods 48.4 48.4 $ 114.6 $ 102.0 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 6 . Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 % of equity interest in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology, for $ 305 million in cash adjusted for (i) estimated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the closing (ii) estimated indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the closing, (iii) unpaid portion as of the closing of certain transaction expenses incurred by DisplayLink, and (iv) the amount that the estimated working capital of DisplayLink exceeds or falls short, respectively, of a certain specified target working capital set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with $ 3.1 million of the purchase price held in escrow accounts for adjustments after closing and to secure the Seller Parties’ indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 , or the DisplayLink Closing Date, whereupon we obtained high-performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business. This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at September 26, 2020, is preliminary and subject to change and is based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. Additional information, which existed as of the acquisition date but is yet unknown to us, may become known to us during the remainder of the measurement period, which will not exceed 12 months from the DisplayLink Closing Date. Changes to amounts will be recorded as adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized as of the DisplayLink Closing Date and may result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the period in which new information becomes available. 10 The adjusted purchase price paid for DisplayLink was $ 443.2 million, which continues to be subject to change for working capital adjustments as allowed under the Merger Agreement. The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Cash and cash equivalents $ 40.9 Short-term investments 94.0 Accounts receivable, net 7.1 Inventory 33.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 6.8 Property and equipment 6.8 Intangible assets 193.0 Right-of-use lease asset 20.0 Non-current other assets 0.6 Total identifiable assets acquired 402.3 Accounts payable ( 5.2 ) Other accrued liabilities ( 9.9 ) Short-term lease liabilities ( 1.7 ) Long-term lease liabilities ( 18.2 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 31.4 ) Total liabilities ( 66.4 ) Net identifiable assets acquired 335.9 Goodwill 107.3 Net assets acquired $ 443.2 The following table summarizes the preliminary estimate of the intangible assets as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 3.0 $ 82.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 3.0 54.0 In process research and development N/A 51.0 Trade names 4.0 3.0 Licensed technology 2.5 3.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 193.0 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 11.0% to 11.5%. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. In-process research and development consists of a next generation docking and video interface products for the IoT market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in early fiscal 2023. 11 The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DisplayLink as of the DisplayLink Closing Date. As of September 26, 2020, none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the DisplayLink acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DisplayLink. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 16.9 million of revenue from DisplayLink from the DisplayLink Closing Date through September 26, 2020. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DisplayLink as we integrated a substantial portion of DisplayLink into our ongoing operations during the quarter . The following unaudited pro forma financial information (in millions, except per share data) presents the combined results of operations for us and DisplayLink as if the DisplayLink acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the actual operating results that would have been recorded had the DisplayLink acquisition actually taken place on June 30, 2019 and should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated operating results. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma financial results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits from the DisplayLink acquisition. Three Months Ended September 2020 (1) 2019 Revenue $ 335.7 $ 365.1 Net income/(loss) ( 2.1 ) 1.1 (1) Includes results of Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income included adjustments for historical amortization expense, the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, transaction costs and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were an increase to net income/(loss) of $ 7.1 million and a decrease of net income/(loss) of $ 12.2 million, respectively. Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business On July 2, 2020 , we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $ 250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020 , or the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years . We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business . The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date is preliminary and subject to change and is based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists. Additional information, which existed as of the acquisition date but is yet unknown to us, may become known to us during the remainder of the measurement period, which will not exceed 12 months from the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. Changes to amounts recorded as acquired intangible assets and liabilities assumed will be recorded as adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date and may result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the period in which new information becomes available. The following table summarizes the adjusted purchase price paid for the Broadcom Business Acquisition (in millions): Cash $ 250.1 Adjustments to consideration transferred, net 1.5 Roadmap products - estimated cost of development ( 25.0 ) $ 226.6 We entered into a derivative and roadmap product agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Broadcom. The derivative and roadmap product agreement includes the purchase of derivative and roadmap product development services to be performed by 12 Broadcom . We estimated the value of the development services to be approximately $ 25.0 million , accounted for it separate from the business combination , and included $ 10.0 million in p repaid expenses and other current assets and $ 15.0 million ($ 13.3 million after amortization as of September 26, 2020) in n on-current other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets . The estimated value of the development services is amortiz ing over the period of time estimated to complete the development or approximately thirty months. The amortization of the estimated cost of development is included in research and development in our c ondensed c onsolidated s tatements of c omprehensive i ncome /(loss) . In addition, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees and Broadcom agreed to make cash payments to transferred employees as incentive to accept employment offers from our company. We determined $ 3.5 million of value related to these arrangements should be included as consideration transferred, which was partially offset by $ 2.0 million of cash payments to transferred employees as a reduction of consideration transferred . The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Property and equipment $ 1.0 Acquired intangible assets 123.0 Total identifiable assets acquired 124.0 Liabilities assumed ( 0.2 ) Goodwill 102.8 Net assets acquired $ 226.6 We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which is 2.2 % for order backlog and 13.0 % for the rest of the intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimate of the intangible assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions): Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 6.0 $ 93.0 Customer contracts and related relationships 6.0 18.0 Order backlog 0.5 12.0 Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles $ 123.0 The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Broadcom Business assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. As of September 26, 2020, all of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Prior to the Broadcom Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Broadcom. The condensed consolidated financial statements include approximately $ 15.3 million of revenue from the Broadcom Business Acquisition from the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date through September 26, 2020. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Broadcom Business Acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition into our ongoing operations during the quarter . 13 We determined it is impractical to include pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information for the Broadcom Business Acquisition as the business was part of Broadcom and did not have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate. 7. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets (in millions): September 2020 June 2020 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Audio and video technology 5.4 $ 138.6 $ ( 82.7 ) $ 55.9 $ 138.6 $ ( 76.5 ) $ 62.1 Customer relationships 4.2 125.5 ( 39.5 ) 86.0 81.8 ( 61.4 ) 20.4 Wireless connectivity technology 6.0 93.0 ( 2.6 ) 90.4 — — — Video interface technology 3.0 82.0 ( 4.6 ) 77.4 — — — Display driver technology 7.0 20.4 ( 15.3 ) 5.1 164.0 ( 158.2 ) 5.8 Backlog 0.5 12.0 ( 4.0 ) 8.0 — — — Licensed technology and other 4.1 13.0 ( 6.2 ) 6.8 7.7 ( 5.5 ) 2.2 Patents 8.0 4.4 ( 2.7 ) 1.7 4.4 ( 2.6 ) 1.8 Tradename 5.1 4.8 ( 0.9 ) 3.9 1.8 ( 0.7 ) 1.1 In process research and development N/A 51.0 — 51.0 — — — Acquired intangibles totals 5.1 $ 544.7 $ ( 158.5 ) $ 386.2 $ 398.3 $ ( 304.9 ) $ 93.4 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 25.4 million and $ 18.2 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. During the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, $ 18.7 million and $ 15.3 million, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of September 26, 2020 (in millions): Remainder of 2021 $ 84.7 2022 99.0 2023 86.1 2024 25.9 2025 19.0 Thereafter 20.5 To be determined 51.0 Future amortization $ 386.2 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Changes in our goodwill balance for the three months ended September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Beginning balance $ 360.8 Acquisition activity 210.1 Ending balance $ 570.9 14 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2029 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the three months ended September 26, 2020, we recorded approximately $ 2.4 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of September 26, 2020, the components of leases and lease costs are as follows (in millions): September June 2020 2020 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 38.7 $ 21.0 Operating lease liabilities $ 9.2 $ 6.5 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 29.7 14.6 Total operating lease liabilities $ 38.9 $ 21.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 1.9 $ 2.3 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 1.8 2.0 As of September 26, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term is 6.3 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.03 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2021 $ 7.6 2022 9.6 2023 6.0 2024 4.6 2025 3.7 Thereafter 12.6 Total future minimum operating lease payments 44.1 Less: interest ( 5.2 ) Total lease liabilities $ 38.9 9. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): September June 2020 2020 Customer obligations $ 35.9 $ 29.0 Inventory obligations 27.6 27.9 Operating lease liabilities 9.2 6.5 Other 29.9 27.6 $ 102.6 $ 91.0 15 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): September June 2020 2020 Operating lease liabilities, long-term $ 29.7 $ 14.6 Deferred tax liability 27.9 — Income taxes payable, long-term 15.9 16.4 Other 13.8 13.0 $ 87.3 $ 44.0 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 11. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 16 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. This criteria has not been met as of September 26, 2020. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the three months ended September 26, 2020, were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2020 Interest expense $ 0.7 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 4.8 Total interest $ 5.5 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of September 26, 2020 were $ 3.4 million and $ 30.3 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders, related to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration cost and expenses to 30 % from 15 % of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75 :1.00 from 3.50 :1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5 :00:1.00 from 3.75 :1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments . The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2020, there was a $ 100.0 million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the three months ended September 26, 2020 was 2.75 %. 17 The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $ 2.3 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the Administrative Agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. As of September 26, 2020, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 Cost of revenue $ 0.8 $ 0.7 Research and development 11.0 7.5 Selling, general, and administrative 9.7 3.0 Total $ 21.5 $ 11.2 Income tax expense/(benefit) on share-based compensation $ ( 3.6 ) $ ( 0.9 ) 18 Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 Research and development 5.8 Selling, general, and administrative 1.3 Total $ 7.2 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the replaced share-based compensation plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, cash incentive awards, performance shares, PSUs, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 2,590,000 as of October 27, 2020. The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual is eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our Company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our Company. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Outstanding as of June 2020 329,786 $ 69.78 Exercised ( 63,228 ) 61.42 Expired ( 49,058 ) 74.44 Outstanding and Exercisable as of September 2020 217,500 71.16 $ 2.2 19 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 25, 2020 of $ 78.22 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. Restricted Stock Units RSU activity was as follows: Aggregate RSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 1,360,324 Granted 692,858 Delivered ( 118,956 ) Forfeited ( 80,582 ) Balance as of September 2020 1,853,644 $ 145.0 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 25, 2020 of $ 78.22 . Of the shares delivered, 42,024 shares valued at $ 3.4 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to certain of our employees. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200 % payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75 th percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50 th percentile equal to 100 % of target. 20 For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200 %, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR. For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 391,532 Granted 101,009 Delivered ( 46,497 ) Forfeited ( 14,773 ) Balance as of September 2020 431,271 $ 33.7 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 25, 2020 of $ 78.22 . We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 28.2 million as of September 26, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.4 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of certain performance criteria (for PSUs granted in fiscal 2021 it is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses and for the PSUs granted prior to fiscal 2021 it is based on non-GAAP earnings per share). The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. 21 Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our C ompany at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 333,848 Awarded 170,994 Forfeited ( 36,079 ) Balance as of September 2020 468,763 $ 36.7 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 25, 2020 of $ 78.22 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 23.3 million as of September 26, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.4 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 82.11 per unit at September 26, 2020 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 7.2 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Aggregate Phantom Intrinsic Stock Units Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 2020 789,113 Forfeited ( 50,718 ) Balance as of September 2020 738,395 $ 57.8 22 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 25, 2020 of $ 78.22 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 42.3 million as of September 26, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.1 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the three months ended September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 134,601 Weighted average purchase price $ 48.67 Cash received $ 6.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 4.6 13. Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the income tax provision for the three months ended September 26, 2020. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items and jurisdictions where annual effective tax rate cannot be reasonably estimated. In these cases, we will determine the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $ 3.6 million and a benefit of $ 4.9 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and global intangible low taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions remained unchanged during the three months ended September 26, 2020, at $ 22.0 million, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 26, 2020 were $ 1.7 million; this balance decreased by $ 0.2 million compared to June 27, 2020, largely due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $ 3.4 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the United Kingdom. From fiscal 2014 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Mobile product market, the personal computing, or PC, 23 product market, and the Internet of Things , or IoT, product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs . Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 China $ 131.2 $ 176.8 Japan 103.1 63.2 Taiwan 71.8 65.2 Other 16.0 16.5 South Korea 5.0 16.4 United States 1.3 1.8 $ 328.4 $ 339.9 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 Mobile product applications $ 133.5 $ 184.3 PC product applications 80.5 67.8 IoT product applications 114.4 87.8 $ 328.4 $ 339.9 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 Customer A 21 % * Customer B 13 % * Customer C * 12 % Customer D * 12 % ____________________ * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: September June 2020 2020 Customer A 25 % 21 % Customer B 18 % 18 % 15. Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Our comprehensive income/(loss) generally consists of net income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 24 16. Restructuring Activities During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated restructuring activities, which included severance costs for activities intended to gain synergies from our recent acquisitions. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss), and are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2021 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 3.7 Cash payments ( 1.9 ) Balance as of September 2020 $ 1.8 During fiscal 2020, we initiated restructuring activities, some of which included severance costs which were for activities intended to further improve efficiencies in our operational activities to align our cost structure consistent with our revenue levels and severance costs related to employees who transitioned with the sale of our assets of our TDDI product line for LCD mobile displays. The restructuring costs related to these activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss). Some of the activities relating to these restructurings are complete as of June 27, 2020. The remaining activities are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. The restructuring liability activity for these restructuring activities during fiscal 2021 was as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Balance as of June 2020 $ 6.1 Accruals 1.9 Cash payments ( 6.1 ) Balance as of September 2020 $ 1.9 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 26, 2020 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). For ease of presentation, this Report shows reporting periods ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to following: our dependence on our solutions for the mobile product applications market and the PC product applications market for a substantial portion of our revenue; risks related to the volatility of our net revenue from our solutions for mobile product applications; our dependence on one or more large customers; the risk that our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by heath epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets; the risk that our product solutions for new markets will not be successful; our ability to maintain and build relationships with our customers; our dependence on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and deliverable schedule; and the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread broadly in the U.S. and globally. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate governments took rapid and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or have missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measured have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority. Many of our employees are able to work from home to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment. For those employees that are comfortable returning to an office work environment, we have introduced various return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations, to monitor and assess the health of our employees, including temperature checks and risk assessments, and further require all employees that do work in the office to wear face coverings and social distance while in communal locations in the office. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we expect that it will continue to weigh on our business and consolidated results of operations in the near term and may further impact our financial condition (including liquidity) in the future. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to anticipate. While we have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact COVID-19 will have on our future results due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the severity and duration of future surges of the outbreak, further containment actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and suppliers and other factors. 26 We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition , and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences .

With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 27 Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments . Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Acquisitions DisplayLink On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in high-performance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020. As of September 26, 2020, our preliminary purchase consideration was $443.2 million, subject to certain additional post-closing adjustments. The results of DisplayLink are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from August 1, 2020 through September 26, 2020. For further discussion of the DisplayLink acquisition, see Note 6 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Broadcom On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. The results of the Broadcom Business Acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from July 24, 2020 through September 26, 2020. For further discussion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition, see Note 6 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Divestiture In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement for cash consideration of $138.7 million and had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020. The gain on sale of this business component was $105.1 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Business Combinations We have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill recognized in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach. The valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations. Other than the above item, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended September 26, 2020, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. 28 Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended September 2020 2019 $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 133.5 $ 184.3 $ (50.8 ) (27.6 %) PC product applications 80.5 67.8 12.7 18.7 % IoT product applications 114.4 87.8 26.6 30.3 % Net revenue 328.4 339.9 (11.5 ) (3.4 %) Gross margin 134.5 126.2 8.3 6.6 % Operating expenses: Research and development 80.9 86.0 (5.1 ) (5.9 %) Selling, general, and administrative 35.3 27.5 7.8 28.4 % Acquired intangibles amortization 6.7 2.9 3.8 131.0 % Restructuring costs 5.6 6.6 (1.0 ) (15.2 %) Operating income 6.0 3.2 2.8 87.5 % Interest and other expense, net (4.7 ) (3.6 ) (1.1 ) (30.6 %) Income/(loss) before provision/ (benefit) for income taxes 1.3 (0.4 ) 1.7 425.0 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes 3.6 (4.9 ) 8.5 173.5 % Equity investment loss (0.5 ) (0.5 ) - 0.0 % Net income/(loss) $ (2.8 ) $ 4.0 $ (6.8 ) (170.0 %) Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point September Increase/ 2020 2019 (Decrease) Mobile product applications 40.7 % 54.3 % (13.6 %) PC product applications 24.5 % 19.9 % 4.6 % IoT product applications 34.8 % 25.8 % 9.0 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % (0.0 %) Gross margin 41.0 % 37.1 % 3.9 % Operating expenses: Research and development 24.6 % 25.3 % (0.7 %) Selling, general, and administrative 10.7 % 8.1 % 2.6 % Acquired intangibles amortization 2.0 % 0.9 % 1.1 % Restructuring costs 1.7 % 1.9 % (0.2 %) Operating income 1.8 % 0.9 % 0.9 % Interest and other expense, net (1.4 %) (1.1 %) (0.3 %) Income/(loss) before provision/ (benefit) for income taxes 0.4 % (0.1 %) 0.5 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes 1.1 % (1.4 %) 2.5 % Equity investment loss (0.2 %) (0.1 %) (0.1 %) Net income/(loss) (0.9 %) 1.2 % (2.1 %) 29 Net Revenue Net revenue was $328.4 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, compared with $339.9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 3.4%. Of this net revenue, $133.5 million, or 40.7%, was from Mobile product applications, $114.4 million, or 34.8%, was from IoT product applications, and $80.5 million, or 24.5%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended September 26, 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 23%) as well as slightly lower average selling prices for Mobile product applications. The decline in unit sales in Mobile product applications was primarily due to the divestiture of our TDDI business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Net revenue from IoT product applications, which includes products from both acquisitions that closed in July 2020, increased as a result of higher average selling prices for IoT product applications due to our product sales mix (which increased 24%) and an increase in units sold (which increased 5%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 8%) for PC product applications as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 10%). Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 41.0%, or $134.5 million, for the three months ended September 26, 2020, compared with 37.1%, or $126.2 million, for the three months ended September 28, 2019. The 390 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended September 26, 2020, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and product cost reductions, partially offset by a $10.5 million increase in amortization for amortizable intangibles related to the acquisition of DisplayLink and the Broadcom Business Acquisition and $9.8 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the DisplayLink acquisition. We continuously introduce new product solutions, that may have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $5.1 million to $80.9 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, compared with the three months ended September 28, 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $3.7 million decrease due to acquired in-process research and development recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a net $2.9 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which was due to a reduction in average headcount for the three months ended September 26, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2019, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs, partially offset by increased headcount as a result of recent acquisitions; a $1.3 million decrease in travel related costs, partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million in project related costs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $7.8 million to $35.3 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, compared with the three months ended September 28, 2019. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $6.7 million increase in stock based compensation costs which was incurred in connection with grants of awards primarily to new employees in fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as a $1.4 million increase in legal and accounting fees related to recent acquisitions. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $5.6 million in the three months ended September 26, 2020 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs. Restructuring activities commenced in each of fiscal 2020 and 2021 and are all expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2021. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other expense, net increased $1.0 million to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, as compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019. The increase in interest and other expense, net is primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances and interest rates, higher interest expense on our debt due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit, partially offset by $1.2 million income from the sale of non-operating assets. 30 Provision for Income Taxes . On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security , or CARES , Act was enacted and signed into law. T he CARES Act did not have a material impact o n the income tax provision for the three months ended September 26, 2020. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items, and jurisdictions where annual effective tax rate cannot be reasonably estimated. In these cases, we will determine the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $3.6 million and a benefit of $4.9 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible officer compensation, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed at lower rates, research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. . Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $180.2 million as of September 26, 2020, compared with $763.4 million as of June 27, 2020, a decrease of $583.2 million. The decrease primarily reflected $621.8 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, partially offset by $31.1 million of proceeds from maturities of investments, $10.4 of proceeds from issuance of shares and $6.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of September 26, 2020, $158.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes to repatriate certain of these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the three months ended September 26, 2020 generated $6.5 million compared with $47.3 million net cash generated during the three months ended September 28, 2019. For the three months ended September 26, 2020, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $47.7 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $38.4 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $25.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a $16.2 million decrease in income taxes payable, a $11.4 million increase in other assets, and a $10.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $20.5 million decrease in inventories and a $11.7 increase in accounts payable. From June 27, 2020 to September 26, 2020, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 63 days compared to 62 days. Our annual inventory turns remained flat at six. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 26, 2020 primarily consisted of $621.8 million used for the acquisition of businesses and $3.9 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $31.1 million in proceeds from maturities of investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 26, 2020 was $4.8 million compared with $16.8 million used in financing activities for the three months ended September 28, 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 26, 2020 consisted of $10.4 of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $5.6 million used for payroll taxes on RSUs and MSUs. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of September 26, 2020, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through September 26, 2020, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the three months ended September 26, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of September 26, 2020, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $177.4 million. 31 Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC and the assets of Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.’s multimedia solutions business. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Commencing June 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration cost and expenses to 30% from 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75:1.00 from 3.50:1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5:00:1.00 from 3.75:1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s existing convertible senior notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition 32 matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments. As of September 26, 2020 , there was $100.0 million balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The weighted average annualized interest rate on these borrowings for the three months ended September 26, 2020 was 2.75 %. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions based on specific covenant calculations. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the Company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Although consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including the DisplayLink acquisition, the Broadcom Business Acquisition, and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. On April 2, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million under the Credit Agreement in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility out of an abundance of caution as a result of the ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global markets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. 33 Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Year 2025 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 4.7 $ 627.7 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 632.4 Leases 7.6 9.6 6.0 4.6 3.7 12.6 44.1 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 37.9 3.0 3.0 — — — 43.9 Transition tax payable (3) — 0.9 1.8 2.4 3.0 — 8.1 Total $ 50.2 $ 641.2 $ 10.8 $ 7.0 $ 6.7 $ 12.6 $ 728.5 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the remaining balance of the one-time transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $22.0 million. As of September 26, 2020, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 34 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of September 26, 2020, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are working from home while under governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We assessed, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, any change in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Report. Our assessment excluded DisplayLink which was acquired on July 31, 2020. DisplayLink had net revenues of approximately $16.9 million and total tangible assets of approximately $136.6 million, which are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 26, 2020. We are currently assessing the control environment of this acquired business. DisplayLink sales constitute approximately 5.1% of our sales for the three-month period covered by this Report, their tangible assets constitute approximately 16.7% of our tangible assets as of the end of such period and their total liabilities constitute approximately 6.5% of our total liabilities. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. During the integration period, management is developing additional controls to ensure the financial information provided by DisplayLink is complete and accurate in all material respects. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 26, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 35 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020 for material risks that may affect our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2021. As of September 26, 2020, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $177.4 million. During the three-month period ended September 26, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares under our common stock repurchase program. 36 ITEM 6.

(unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2020 is a 52-week period ending June 27, 2020, and our fiscal 2019 was a 52-week period ending on June 29, 2019. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13- and 39-weeks for the three and nine months ended March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019. For simplicity, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020, the quarter ended September 30, 2019, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-02, Leases, or Topic 842, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, respectively, and net losses of $ 0.1 million and $ 0.7 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within operating lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our 9 obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Asset Acquisition We acquired an emerging technology startup company focused on the design of high-speed connectivity products in August 2019. The purchase price primarily included $ 2.5 million in cash paid at the closing, and up to $ 6.5 million in contingent consideration which is payable in set amounts upon meeting various milestones on dates from December 2021 through December 2023 . As of March 31, 2020, we have accrued $ 1.3 million of the contingent consideration as that is the portion which is currently estimable and probable. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase and accordingly we expensed $ 3.7 million of in-process research and development, recorded liabilities of approximately $ 1.5 million and recorded a long-term deferred tax asset of $ 0.3 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Divestiture In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration product line, or TDDI, for LCD mobile displays. We will retain our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. Subject to certain post-closing adjustments and indemnification obligations, the aggregate consideration payable by the buyer will be $ 120.0 million in cash, the dollar value of specified inventory at a purchase price of standard cost plus 5 % in cash, and the assumption of certain liabilities as set forth in the asset purchase agreement. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement, have a preliminary carrying value of approximately $ 30.1 million as of March 31, 2020, and have been included as $ 12.5 million of current assets held for sale and $ 17.6 million of non-current assets held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement in April 2020 for cash consideration of $ 120.0 million plus a preliminary inventory amount of $ 19.4 million. 10 2. Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On June 30, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted by ASC 842. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases. The standard had a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet but did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. The adoption of this new standard at June 30, 2019, resulted in the following changes: • assets increased by $ 27.8 million, primarily representing the recognition of ROU assets for operating leases; and • liabilities increased by $ 28.4 million, primarily representing the recognition of lease liabilities for operating leases. 3. Revenue Recognition We adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, at the beginning of our fiscal 2019. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were $ 0.6 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2020 and $ 0.9 million as of June 30, 2019. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 6.7 million and $ 24.2 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2020, and $ 4.5 million and $ 47.5 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the nine months ended March 31, 2020, and the nine months 11 ended March 31, 2019 , we recognized $ 1.4 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities , which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year . We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of March 31, 2020, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 4. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 5.0 $ 6.7 $ 28.8 $ 23.3 Denominator: Shares, basic 34.0 34.4 33.5 34.7 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 1.0 0.6 1.0 0.8 Shares, diluted 35.0 35.0 34.5 35.5 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.15 $ 0.19 $ 0.86 $ 0.67 Diluted $ 0.14 $ 0.19 $ 0.83 $ 0.66 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, deferred stock units, or DSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 345,783 and 1,558,936 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 800,857 and 1,434,049 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 5. Fair Value Our financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis under the fair value hierarchy, consisted of money market funds within level 1 financial assets and totaled $ 262.2 million and $ 313.7 million as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. These money market funds were included in cash and cash equivalents in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. 12 6. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, June 30, 2020 2019 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 48.6 $ 110.7 Finished goods 46.9 48.0 $ 95.5 $ 158.7 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. As of March 31, 2020, we transferred $ 12.5 million of inventory to current assets held for sale. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation under the heading Divestiture included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report . 7. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 (in millions): March 31, 2020 June 30, 2019 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ ( 157.5 ) $ 6.5 $ 164.0 $ ( 148.1 ) $ 15.9 Audio and video technology 5.3 138.6 ( 69.7 ) 68.9 138.6 ( 49.4 ) 89.2 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 ( 58.5 ) 23.3 81.8 ( 49.9 ) 31.9 Fingerprint authentication technology Not applicable — — — 47.2 ( 47.2 ) — Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 ( 5.0 ) 2.7 7.7 ( 3.6 ) 4.1 Patents 8.1 4.4 ( 2.5 ) 1.9 4.4 ( 2.0 ) 2.4 Tradename 7.0 1.8 ( 0.7 ) 1.1 1.8 ( 0.5 ) 1.3 Acquired intangibles, gross 3.1 $ 398.3 $ ( 293.9 ) $ 104.4 $ 445.5 $ ( 300.7 ) $ 144.8 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 11.1 million and $ 18.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 40.4 million and $ 56.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, $ 8.1 million and $ 15.2 million, respectively, and $ 31.6 million and $ 47.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of March 31, 2020 (in millions): Remainder of 2020 $ 11.1 2021 37.4 2022 32.9 2023 20.4 2024 2.5 2025 0.1 Future amortization $ 104.4 13 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There was a reclassification of $ 11.0 million of goodwill to non-current assets held for sale during the nine months ended March 31, 2020. 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2026 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the nine months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $ 6.9 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of March 31, 2020, the components of leases and lease costs are as follows (in millions): March 31, 2020 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 23.8 Operating lease liabilities $ 7.6 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 16.2 Total operating lease liabilities $ 23.8 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 7.1 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 2.8 As of March 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term is 3.7 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.21 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2020 $ 2.3 2021 7.9 2022 7.2 2023 4.0 2024 2.4 Thereafter 1.9 Total future minimum operating lease payments 25.7 Less: interest ( 1.9 ) Total lease liabilities $ 23.8 14 As of the beginning of our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019, our aggregate minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2020 $ 7.4 2021 3.2 2022 0.9 2023 0.3 2024 0.1 Total future minimum operating lease payments $ 11.9 9. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, June 30, 2020 2019 Customer Obligations $ 30.9 $ 52.0 Inventory obligations 30.0 26.7 Operating lease liabilities 7.6 — Warranty 4.0 4.0 Other 20.3 23.4 $ 92.8 $ 106.1 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, June 30, 2020 2019 Income taxes payable, long-term $ 17.4 $ 16.2 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 16.2 — Other 13.4 14.1 $ 47.0 $ 30.3 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 15 11. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, were as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 Interest expense $ 2.0 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 13.7 Total interest $ 15.7 16 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of March 31, 2020 were $ 4.3 million and $ 38.7 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders, related to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring and integration cost and expenses to 30 % from 15 % of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75 :1.00 from 3.50 :1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5 :00:1.00 from 3.75 :1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s existing convertible senior notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2020, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility . In April 2020, we borrowed $ 100.0 million under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions based on specific covenant calculations. Debt issuance costs of $ 2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans . We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or 17 prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Cost of revenue $ 0.8 $ 0.7 $ 2.1 $ 2.4 Research and development 9.0 8.6 24.6 25.4 Selling, general, and administrative 8.1 6.5 17.5 20.9 Total $ 17.9 $ 15.8 $ 44.2 $ 48.7 Income tax expense/(benefit) on share-based compensation $ ( 1.8 ) $ ( 1.8 ) $ ( 4.5 ) $ ( 4.2 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2020 2020 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 $ 0.2 Research and development 3.3 5.8 Selling, general, and administrative 0.7 1.1 Total $ 4.1 $ 7.1 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. New Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the replaced share-based compensation plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance units, and other stock-based awards. The number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 1,230,000 . The 2019 ESPP authorizes the Company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. 18 Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan , subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure . The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual is eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our C ompany (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our C ompany. Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 1,191,929 $ 59.07 Granted — — Exercised ( 445,019 ) 43.48 Forfeited ( 6,828 ) 51.12 Expired ( 297,612 ) 73.95 Balance as of March 31, 2020 442,470 64.86 $ 1.9 Exercisable at March 31, 2020 439,141 64.98 $ 1.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 27, 2020 of $ 58.86 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. Deferred Stock Units DSU activity was as follows: Aggregate DSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 1,878,853 Granted 677,745 Delivered ( 817,223 ) Forfeited ( 317,465 ) Balance as of March 31, 2020 1,421,910 $ 83.7 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 27, 2020 of $ 58.86 . Of the shares delivered, 193,936 shares valued at $ 8.0 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. 19 Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to certain of our employees. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018, and relative to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX Index, for grants made prior to fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR — {SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR}] x 2)) For MSUs vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 210,732 Granted 328,599 Performance adjustment ( 58,707 ) Delivered ( 23,018 ) Forfeited ( 75,980 ) Balance as of March 31, 2020 381,626 $ 22.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 27, 2020 of $ 58.86 . We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 16.5 million as of March 31, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. 20 We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our Company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 192,618 Awarded 328,023 Performance adjustment ( 10,242 ) Released ( 61,668 ) Forfeited ( 93,495 ) Balance as of March 31, 2020 355,236 $ 20.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 27, 2020 of $ 58.86 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 18.5 million as of March 31, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.4 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 60.17 per unit at March 31, 2020 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 7.0 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Aggregate Phantom Intrinsic Stock Units Value Outstanding (in millions) Granted 953,305 Forfeited ( 95,859 ) Balance as of March 31, 2020 857,446 $ 50.5 21 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 27, 2020 of $ 58.86 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 44.6 million as of March 31, 2020, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the nine months ended March 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 346,502 Weighted average purchase price $ 30.50 Cash received $ 10.6 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 10.1 13. Income Taxes On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. As of this filing, we do not believe the CARES Act will have a material impact on the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $ 10.2 million and a benefit of $ 15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The provision for income taxes of $ 17.3 million and the benefit for income taxes of $ 8.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deduction, foreign tax credits and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 2.2 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2020, to $ 21.1 million from $ 18.9 million at June 30, 2019, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2020 were $ 2.0 million; this balance increased by $ 0.1 million compared to June 30, 2019. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $ 2.5 million. In February 2020, Altera Corporation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision that reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner , which found that Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost sharing agreement with a related party 22 were invalid . As of March 31, 2020, there has been no response from the Supreme Court. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. However, due to uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case, we will continue to monitor developments in this case . Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2013 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 examination by the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our case was reviewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which concluded in September 2019 with no further impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Mobile product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 China $ 122.1 $ 190.0 $ 437.1 $ 669.5 Japan 128.1 58.4 340.8 204.9 Taiwan 42.3 47.6 164.0 185.0 Other 21.1 19.6 58.1 48.9 South Korea 13.1 13.8 51.0 45.6 United States 1.4 4.6 5.3 23.2 $ 328.1 $ 334.0 $ 1,056.3 $ 1,177.1 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Mobile product applications $ 176.6 $ 204.7 $ 578.6 $ 741.8 PC product applications 78.9 66.2 228.3 198.7 IoT product applications 72.6 63.1 249.4 236.6 $ 328.1 $ 334.0 $ 1,056.3 $ 1,177.1 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Customer A 21 % * 17 % * Customer B 13 % 10 % 12 % * Customer C * 17 % * 18 % Customer D * 16 % * 14 % * Less than 10 % 23 We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: March 31, June 30, 2020 2019 Customer A 18 % * Customer B 17 % * Customer C 12 % 25 % Customer D * 16 % * Less than 10 % 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income plus the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments, primarily due to temporary changes in market value of certain of our auction rate securities, or ARS, investments. In addition, we recognize the noncredit portion of other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in other comprehensive income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities In November 2019, we committed to and initiated activities to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operational activities to align our cost structure consistent with our revenue levels. Restructuring costs related to the November 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. These costs related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount. The activities relating to the November 2019 restructuring action are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2020. The restructuring liability activities relating to the November 2019 initiated activity during fiscal 2020 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 16.2 Cash payments ( 10.0 ) Balance as of March 31, 2020 $ 6.2 In August 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring of our mobile fingerprint optical business. The costs for this restructuring activity primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount and related costs. These activities were complete as of June 30, 2019. In June 2019, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to reduce our operating cost structure further. The costs for this restructuring action primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount. Restructuring costs related to these fiscal 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. The activities relating to the June 2019 restructuring action are complete as of March 31, 2020. The restructuring liability activities for the fiscal 2019 initiated activity during fiscal 2019 and the nine months ended March 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 17.7 Cash payments ( 12.5 ) Balance as of June 30, 2019 5.2 Accruals 7.7 Cash payments ( 12.7 ) Balance as of March 31, 2020 $ 0.2 In March 2020, we recorded severance costs related to employees who would be transitioning with the sale of our TDDI business in April 2020. For further information, See Note 1 Basis of Presentation under the heading Divestiture included in the 24 condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report . The restructuring liability activity for this restructuring activity during the nine months ended March 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions ): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 2.3 Cash payments — Balance as of March 31, 2020 $ 2.3 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2020 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). For ease of presentation, this Report shows reporting periods ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risks as identified in this Report, the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports.

Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread rapidly in the U.S. and globally. Governmental authorities have implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic is currently uncertain, we expect that it will adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations in the near term and may impact our financial condition (including liquidity) in the future. While we have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact COVID-19 will have on our future results due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, a potential future recurrence of the outbreak, further containment actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and suppliers and other factors. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition, and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, products which include smart devices with voice, speech and video solutions, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. The solutions we deliver either contain or consist of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, or video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, customer-specific firmware, and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. 26 Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology ; backlog ; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as impairment recovery on investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. 27 Divestiture In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We will retain our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. Subject to certain post-closing adjustments and indemnification obligations, the aggregate consideration payable by the buyer will be $120.0 million in cash, the dollar value of specified inventory at a purchase price of standard cost plus 5% in cash, and the assumption of certain liabilities, as set forth in the asset purchase agreement. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement, have a preliminary carrying value of approximately $30.1 million as of March 31, 2020, and have been included as $12.5 million of current assets held for sale and $17.6 million of non-current assets held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement in April 2020 for cash consideration of $120.0 million plus a preliminary inventory amount of $19.4 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change 2020 2019 $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 176.6 $ 204.7 $ (28.1 ) (13.7 %) $ 578.6 $ 741.8 $ (163.2 ) (22.0 %) PC product applications 78.9 66.2 12.7 19.2 % 228.3 198.7 29.6 14.9 % IoT product applications 72.6 63.1 9.5 15.1 % 249.4 236.6 12.8 5.4 % Net revenue 328.1 334.0 (5.9 ) (1.8 %) 1,056.3 1,177.1 (120.8 ) (10.3 %) Gross margin 135.6 116.0 19.6 16.9 % 421.1 406.7 14.4 3.5 % Operating expenses: Research and development 75.8 82.6 (6.8 ) (8.2 %) 238.8 256.9 (18.1 ) (7.0 %) Selling, general, and administrative 31.6 34.2 (2.6 ) (7.6 %) 90.6 103.6 (13.0 ) (12.5 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.9 3.0 (0.1 ) (3.3 %) 8.8 8.8 - 0.0 % Restructuring costs 6.3 - 6.3 100.0 % 26.2 10.4 15.8 151.9 % Operating income 19.0 (3.8 ) 22.8 600.0 % 56.7 27.0 29.7 110.0 % Interest and other expense, net (3.2 ) (4.3 ) 1.1 25.6 % (9.1 ) (10.5 ) 1.4 13.3 % Income/(loss) before provision/ (benefit) for income taxes 15.8 (8.1 ) 23.9 295.1 % 47.6 16.5 31.1 188.5 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes 10.2 (15.3 ) 25.5 166.7 % 17.3 (8.1 ) 25.4 313.6 % Equity investment loss (0.6 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) (20.0 %) (1.5 ) (1.3 ) (0.2 ) (15.4 %) Net income $ 5.0 $ 6.7 $ (1.7 ) (25.4 %) $ 28.8 $ 23.3 $ 5.5 23.6 % 28 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows : Three Months Ended Percentage Point Nine Months Ended Percentage Point March 31, Increase/ March 31, Increase/ 2020 2019 (Decrease) 2020 2019 (Decrease) Mobile product applications 53.9 % 61.3 % (7.4 %) 54.8 % 63.0 % (8.2 %) PC product applications 24.0 % 19.8 % 4.2 % 21.6 % 16.9 % 4.7 % IoT product applications 22.1 % 18.9 % 3.2 % 23.6 % 20.1 % 3.5 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 41.3 % 34.7 % 6.6 % 39.9 % 34.6 % 5.3 % Operating expenses: Research and development 23.1 % 24.7 % (1.6 %) 22.6 % 21.8 % 0.8 % Selling, general, and administrative 9.6 % 10.2 % (0.6 %) 8.6 % 8.8 % (0.2 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.0 % 0.8 % 0.7 % 0.1 % Restructuring costs 1.9 % 0.0 % 1.9 % 2.5 % 0.9 % 1.6 % Operating income 5.8 % (1.1 %) 6.9 % 5.4 % 2.3 % 3.1 % Interest and other expense, net (1.0 %) (1.3 %) 0.3 % (0.9 %) (0.9 %) 0.0 % Income/(loss) before provision/ (benefit) for income taxes 4.8 % (2.4 %) 7.2 % 4.5 % 1.4 % 3.1 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes 3.1 % (4.6 %) 7.7 % 1.6 % (0.7 %) 2.3 % Equity investment loss (0.2 %) (0.1 %) (0.1 %) (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income 1.5 % 2.0 % (0.5 %) 2.7 % 2.0 % 0.7 % Net Revenue Net revenue was $328.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with $334.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of $5.9 million, or 1.8%. Of this net revenue, $176.6 million, or 53.9%, was from Mobile product applications, $72.6 million, or 22.1%, was from IoT product applications, and $78.9 million, or 24.0%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from PC product applications and IoT product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 12.9%) as well as slightly lower average selling prices for Mobile product applications. Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 13.0%) for PC product applications as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 5.5%). Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 29.7%), partially offset by lower average selling prices for IoT product applications (which decreased 11.3%). Net revenue was $1,056.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, compared with $1,177.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of $120.8 million, or 10.3%. Of this net revenue, $578.6 million, or 54.8%, was from Mobile product applications, $249.4 million, or 23.6%, was from IoT product applications, and $228.3 million, or 21.6%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from PC product applications and IoT product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 21.7%) as well as slightly lower average selling prices for Mobile product applications. Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to higher average selling prices (which increased 10.6%) as well as a small increase in units sold. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 12.9%), partially offset by lower average selling prices for IoT product applications. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 41.3%, or $135.6 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with 34.7%, or $116.0 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The 660 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2020, was primarily due to a favorable product mix, and product cost reductions, and a $7.1 million decrease in amortization for amortizable intangibles which are now fully amortized. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 39.9%, or $421.1 million, for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, compared with 34.6%, or $406.7 million, for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The 530 basis point increase in gross margin for 29 the nine months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to a favorable product mix , and product cost reductions , and a $ 15.7 million decrease in amortization for amortizable intangibles which are now fully amortized. We continually introduce new product solutions and we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, causing gross margin to vary on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product-specific designs. As a fabless semiconductor company, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $6.8 million to $75.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a net $1.1 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $2.9 million decrease in non-employee services; and a $1.2 million decrease in project related costs. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $2.1 million of retention program costs with key engineering and management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the Company through senior level management and product focus changes. Research and development expenses decreased $18.1 million to $238.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a net $5.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2019, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $5.9 million decrease in non-employee services; a $4.6 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities; a $3.3 million decrease in project related costs. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $6.6 million of retention program costs with key engineering and management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the Company through senior level management and product focus changes. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $2.6 million to $31.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $1.8 million decrease in non-employee services. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $13.0 million to $90.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a net $6.9 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $4.1 million decrease in non-employee services. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $3.9 million of retention program costs with key management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the Company through senior level management and product focus changes. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $26.2 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2020 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs, which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020. The restructuring activities are expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as impairment recovery on investments. Interest and other expense, net decreased $1.4 million to $9.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $10.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in interest and other expense, net is primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher cash balances and interest rates, partially offset by higher non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Provision for Income Taxes. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed into law. We do not believe the CARES Act will have a material impact on the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. 30 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $10.2 million and a benefit of $15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The provision for income taxes of $17.3 million and the benefit for income taxes of $8.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, income taxed at higher tax rates, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deduction, foreign tax credits and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $472.1 million as of March 31, 2020, compared with $327.8 million as of June 30, 2019, an increase of $144.3 million. The increase primarily reflected $168.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $30.0 million of net proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $30.1 million used to repurchase 813,082 shares of our common stock, $11.7 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, $9.3 million used for payroll taxes on DSUs, and $2.5 million used for an asset acquisition completed in August 2019. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of March 31, 2020, $191.6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2020 generated $168.3 million compared with $110.8 million net cash generated during the nine months ended March 31, 2019. For the nine months ended March 31, 2020, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $119.0 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $20.5 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $50.7 million decrease in inventory and a $17.4 million increase in accrued compensation, partially offset by a $27.4 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, a $8.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, a decrease of $8.6 million in accounts payable and a decrease of $5.3 million in income taxes payable. From June 30, 2019 to March 31, 2020, our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 65 days due to a larger percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2019 quarter compared with a smaller percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the March 31, 2020 quarter. Our annual inventory turns increased from five to eight, which was driven by the classification of $12.5 million of inventory as current assets held for sale (which had an impact of 1 turn) as well as stronger product demand throughout the quarter. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2020 consisted of $11.7 million for purchases of property and equipment and $2.5 million used for an asset acquisition completed in August 2019. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 was $9.6 million compared with $73.1 million used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 was related to $30.1 million used to repurchase 813,082 shares of our common stock and $9.3 million used for payroll taxes on DSUs, partially offset by $30.0 of proceeds from issuance of shares. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of March 31, 2020, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares 31 purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through March 31, 2020 , we purchased 31, 747,295 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the nine months ended March 31, 2020 , we repurchased 813,082 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $30.1 million . As of March 31, 2020 , the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program wa s $ 177.5 million. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC and the assets of Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.’s multimedia solutions business. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated September 27, 2017, or the Credit Agreement, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In February 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amendment, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to increase the maximum limit on the add back of certain restructuring 32 and integration cost and expenses to 30% from 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, (ii) modify the negative covenant for Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the end of any fiscal quarter to 4.75:1.00 from 3.50:1.00, and for any four quarter period following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 5:00:1.00 from 3.75:1.00, (iii) modify the circumstances under which the maturity date of the Credit Agreement would be accelerated in advance of the maturity date of the Notes to eliminate the acceleration of the maturity date of the Credit Agreement if we meet certain specified leverage and liquidity covenants, (iv) add a minimum liquidity covenant for each two-week period beginning on the date that is 120 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s existing convertible senior notes, (v) add certain technical amendments to address LIBOR transition matters, and (vi) include or revise certain definitions and certain customary representation, warranties and acknowledgments. As of March 31, 2020, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In April 2020, we borrowed $100.0 million under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date, subject to certain exceptions based on specific covenant calculations. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by the Administrative Agent and the Company, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 4.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 5.0 to 1.00, and thereafter 4.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 2.25 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the Company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Although consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. On April 2, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million under the Credit Agreement in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility out of an abundance of caution as a result of the ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global markets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing 33 activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 1.3 $ 2.6 $ 527.6 $ — $ — $ — $ 531.5 Leases 2.3 7.9 7.2 4.0 2.5 1.9 25.8 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 36.1 13.0 — — — — 49.1 Transition tax payable (3) - - 0.9 1.8 2.4 3.0 8.1 Total $ 39.7 $ 23.5 $ 535.7 $ 5.8 $ 4.9 $ 4.9 $ 614.5 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the remaining balance of the one-time transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $21.1 million. As of March 31, 2020, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 34 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March 31, 2020, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are now working from home while under shelter-in-place orders or other governmental restrictions. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 28, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 35 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We refer you to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019 as well as the risk factors discussed below for material risks that may affect our business. In addition to the risk factors discussed below, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate, or in some cases manifest, other risks discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. Our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate could adversely impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers and customers. Any of these public health threats and related consequences could adversely affect our financial results. COVID-19, a potentially deadly respiratory tract infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has spread rapidly and enveloped most of the world, causing a global public health crisis . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Governments in affected countries are imposing travel bans, quarantines and other emergency public health measures. In response to the virus, national and local governments in numerous countries around the world have implemented substantial lockdown measures, and other countries and local governments may enact similar policies. As of March 31, 2020, the United States has temporarily restricted travel by foreign nationals into the country from a number of areas, including China and Europe. In addition, the federal government and all of the states in the U.S., have declared a state of emergency or similar disaster declaration, and many states, including California where we are headquartered, have enacted shelter-in-place or similar restrictive orders. Companies are also taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses. These restrictions, and future prevention and mitigation measures, are likely to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect our future operations. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to result in sustained market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. Also, some suppliers of materials used in the production of our products may be located in areas more severely impacted by COVID-19, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products. In addition, the severe global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 may cause our customers and end-users of our products to suffer significant economic hardship, which could result in decreased demand for our products in the future and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its duration and ultimate disruption on our customers, end-users, overall demand for our products, supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a more severe adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity). Additionally, weaker economic conditions generally could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets, or our ability to raise additional capital, if needed. 36 IT EM 2.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2020 is a 52-week period ending June 27, 2020, and our fiscal 2019 was a 52-week period ending on June 29, 2019. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13- and 26-weeks for the three and six months ended December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018. For simplicity, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020, the quarter ended September 30, 2019, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-02, Leases, or Topic 842, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $ 0.4 million and net gains of $ 0.1 million in the three and six months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and net losses of $ 0.2 million and $ 0.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within operating lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our 8 obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Asset Acquisition We acquired an emerging technology startup company focused on the design of high-speed connectivity products in August 2019. The purchase price primarily included $ 2.5 million in cash paid at the closing, and up to $ 6.5 million in contingent consideration which is payable in set amounts upon meeting various milestones on dates from December 2021 through December 2023 . As of December 31, 2019, we have accrued $ 1.3 million of the contingent consideration as that is the portion which is currently estimable and probable. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase and accordingly we expensed $ 3.7 million of in-process research and development, recorded liabilities of approximately $ 1.5 million and recorded a long-term deferred tax asset of $ 0.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2019. Divestiture In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration product line, or TDDI, for LCD mobile displays. We will retain our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. Subject to certain post-closing adjustments and indemnification obligations, the aggregate consideration payable by the buyer will be $ 120.0 million in cash, the dollar value of specified inventory at a purchase price of standard cost plus 5 % in cash, and the assumption of certain liabilities as set forth in the asset purchase agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 , subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions. The assets to be sold under the asset purchase agreement, have a carrying value of approximately $ 37.1 million as of December 31, 2019, and have been included as $ 21.0 million of current assets held for sale and $ 16.1 million of non-current assets held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 9 2. Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On June 30, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted by ASC 842. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases. The standard had a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet but did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. The adoption of this new standard at June 30, 2019, resulted in the following changes: • assets increased by $ 27.8 million, primarily representing the recognition of ROU assets for operating leases; and • liabilities increased by $ 28.4 million, primarily representing the recognition of lease liabilities for operating leases. 3. Revenue Recognition We adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, at the beginning of our fiscal 2019. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard, and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangements to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were $0 .8 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and $ 0.9 million as of June 30, 2019. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 5.9 million and $ 21.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, and $ 4.5 million and $ 47.5 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the six months ended December 31, 2019, 10 and the six months ended December 31, 2018 , we recognized $ 0.3 million in revenue related to contract liabilities , which was outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year . We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of December 31, 2019, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 4. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 19.8 $ 12.8 $ 23.8 $ 16.6 Denominator: Shares, basic 33.5 34.5 33.2 34.8 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 0.9 0.6 0.9 0.8 Shares, diluted 34.4 35.1 34.1 35.6 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.59 $ 0.37 $ 0.72 $ 0.48 Diluted $ 0.58 $ 0.36 $ 0.70 $ 0.47 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, deferred stock units, or DSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 775,347 and 1,736,456 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 1,074,778 and 1,426,365 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 5. Fair Value Our financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis under the fair value hierarchy, consisted of money market funds within level 1 financial assets and totaled $ 400.9 million and $ 313.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. These money market funds were included in cash and cash equivalents in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. 11 6. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, June 30, 2019 2019 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 52.3 $ 110.7 Finished goods 29.8 48.0 $ 82.1 $ 158.7 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. As of December 31, 2019, we transferred $ 20.9 million of inventory to current assets held for sale. See Note 1 Basis of presentation under the heading Divestiture included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report . 7. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 (in millions): December 31, 2019 June 30, 2019 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ ( 156.7 ) $ 7.3 $ 164.0 $ ( 148.1 ) $ 15.9 Audio and video technology 5.3 138.6 ( 62.9 ) 75.7 138.6 ( 49.4 ) 89.2 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 ( 55.7 ) 26.1 81.8 ( 49.9 ) 31.9 Fingerprint authentication technology Not applicable — — — 47.2 ( 47.2 ) — Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 ( 4.6 ) 3.1 7.7 ( 3.6 ) 4.1 Patents 8.1 4.4 ( 2.3 ) 2.1 4.4 ( 2.0 ) 2.4 Tradename 7.0 1.8 ( 0.6 ) 1.2 1.8 ( 0.5 ) 1.3 Acquired intangibles, gross 3.1 $ 398.3 $ ( 282.8 ) $ 115.5 $ 445.5 $ ( 300.7 ) $ 144.8 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 11.1 million and $ 18.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 29.3 million and $ 38.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, $ 8.2 million and $ 15.1 million, respectively, and $ 23.5 million and $ 32.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): Remainder of 2020 $ 22.1 2021 37.5 2022 32.9 2023 20.4 2024 2.5 2025 0.1 Future amortization $ 115.5 12 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There was no change in goodwill during the six months ended December 31, 2019. 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2026 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the six months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded approximately $ 4.7 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of December 31, 2019, the components of leases and lease costs are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 24.8 Operating lease liabilities $ 8.3 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 16.8 Total operating lease liabilities $ 25.1 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 4.7 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 1.5 As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term is 3.8 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.21 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2020 $ 4.7 2021 8.6 2022 5.8 2023 3.7 2024 2.5 Thereafter 1.8 Total future minimum operating lease payments 27.1 Less: interest ( 2.0 ) Total lease liabilities $ 25.1 13 As of the beginning of our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019, our aggregate minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2020 $ 7.4 2021 3.2 2022 0.9 2023 0.3 2024 0.1 Total future minimum operating lease payments $ 11.9 9. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, June 30, 2019 2019 Customer Obligations $ 27.3 $ 52.0 Inventory obligations 27.1 26.7 Operating lease liabilities 8.3 — Warranty 4.0 4.0 Other 20.9 23.4 $ 87.6 $ 106.1 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, June 30, 2019 2019 Income taxes payable, long-term $ 17.1 $ 16.2 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 16.8 — Other 15.1 14.1 $ 49.0 $ 30.3 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 14 11. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the six months ended December 31, 2019, were as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 Interest expense $ 1.3 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 9.1 Total interest $ 10.4 15 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of December 31, 2019, were $ 4.8 million and $ 42.8 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our prior term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $ 2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as approved by the Administrative Agent, which is currently anticipated to be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 16 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Cost of revenue $ 0.6 $ 0.8 $ 1.3 $ 1.7 Research and development 8.1 8.5 15.6 16.8 Selling, general, and administrative 6.4 6.9 9.4 14.4 Total $ 15.1 $ 16.2 $ 26.3 $ 32.9 Income tax expense/(benefit) on share-based compensation $ ( 1.8 ) $ 0.3 $ ( 2.7 ) $ ( 2.4 ) Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Cost of revenue $ 0.1 Research and development 2.5 Selling, general, and administrative 0.4 Total $ 3.0 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our equity-settled share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. New Share-Based Compensation Plans On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the replaced share-based compensation plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our board of directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance units, and other stock-based awards. The number of shares approved by stockholders under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 1,230,000 . The 2019 ESPP authorizes the company to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares. Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules’ on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. An individual is eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our company. 17 Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 1,191,929 $ 59.07 Granted — — Exercised ( 180,278 ) 34.43 Forfeited ( 99,108 ) 69.18 Balance as of December 31, 2019 912,543 62.84 $ 8.7 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 906,030 62.93 $ 8.6 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 27, 2019 of $ 66.89 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. Deferred Stock Units DSU activity was as follows: Aggregate DSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 1,878,853 Granted 600,711 Delivered ( 780,121 ) Forfeited ( 225,320 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 1,474,123 $ 98.6 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 27, 2019 of $ 66.89 . Of the shares delivered, 184,466 shares valued at $ 7.4 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plans provide for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors, and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to certain of our employees. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018, and relative to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX Index, for grants made prior to fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two -to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR — {SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR}] x 2)) 18 For MSUs vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. MSU activity was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 210,732 Granted 328,599 Performance adjustment ( 58,707 ) Delivered ( 23,018 ) Forfeited ( 54,774 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 402,832 $ 26.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 27, 2019 of $ 66.89 . We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 19.4 million as of December 31, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 years. Performance Stock Units Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. 19 PSU activity was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 192,618 Awarded 328,023 Performance adjustment ( 10,242 ) Released ( 61,668 ) Forfeited ( 70,441 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 378,290 $ 25.3 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 27, 2019 of $ 66.89 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 21.0 million as of December 31, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. Phantom Stock Units The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years , with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $ 62.02 per unit at December 31, 2019 and our accrued liability for such units was $ 3.0 million. Phantom stock activity was as follows: Aggregate Phantom Intrinsic Stock Units Value Outstanding (in millions) Granted 953,305 Forfeited ( 45,496 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 907,809 $ 60.7 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 27, 2019 of $ 66.89 . The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding phantom stock units was approximately $ 53.3 million as of December 31, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the six months ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): Shares purchased 275,473 Weighted average purchase price $ 25.86 Cash received $ 7.1 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 9.5 20 13. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $ 12.0 million and $ 7.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The provision for income taxes of $ 7.1 million and $ 7.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess share-based compensation deductions, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 1.9 million during the six months ended December 31, 2019, to $ 20.8 million from $ 18.9 million at June 30, 2019, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 were $ 1.9 million; this balance changed less than $ 0.1 million compared to June 30, 2019. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $ 2.6 million. In June 2019, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. However, due to uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2013 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 examination by the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our case was reviewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which concluded in September 2019 with no further impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 21 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Mobile product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 China $ 138.2 $ 251.7 $ 315.0 $ 479.5 Japan 149.5 78.0 212.7 146.5 Taiwan 56.4 61.0 121.6 137.4 South Korea 21.6 11.7 38.0 31.8 Other 20.5 13.9 37.0 29.3 United States 2.1 9.2 3.9 18.6 $ 388.3 $ 425.5 $ 728.2 $ 843.1 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Mobile product applications $ 217.7 $ 274.4 $ 402.0 $ 537.1 PC product applications 81.6 63.9 149.4 132.5 IoT product applications 89.0 87.2 176.8 173.5 $ 388.3 $ 425.5 $ 728.2 $ 843.1 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Customer A 21 % * 15 % * Customer B 13 % * 11 % * Customer C * 20 % * 19 % Customer D * 14 % * 12 % * Less than 10 % We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: December 31, June 30, 2019 2019 Customer A 21 % * Customer B 16 % * Customer C 11 % 25 % Customer D * 16 % * Less than 10 % 22 1 5 . Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income plus the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments, primarily due to temporary changes in market value of certain of our auction rate securities, or ARS, investments. In addition, we recognize the noncredit portion of other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in other comprehensive income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities In November 2019, we committed to and initiated activities to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operational activities to align our cost structure consistent with our revenue levels. Restructuring costs related to the November 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. These costs related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount. The activities relating to the November 2019 restructuring action are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2020. The restructuring liability activities relating to the November 2019 initiated activity during fiscal 2020 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 13.3 Cash payments ( 5.7 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 7.6 In August 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring of our mobile fingerprint optical business. The costs for this restructuring activity primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount and related costs. These activities were complete as of June 30, 2019. In June 2019, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to reduce our operating cost structure further. The costs for this restructuring action primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount. Restructuring costs related to these fiscal 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of income. The activities relating to the June 2019 restructuring action are complete as of December 31, 2019. The restructuring liability for the fiscal 2019 initiated activity during fiscal 2019 and the six months ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 17.7 Cash payments ( 12.5 ) Balance as of June 30, 2019 5.2 Accruals 7.5 Cash payments ( 11.1 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 1.6 23 ITEM 2.

Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, products which include smart devices with voice, speech and video solutions, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. The solutions we deliver either contain or consist of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, or video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, customer-specific firmware, and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. 24 Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs ’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions , which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as impairment recovery on investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Divestiture In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We will retain our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. Subject to certain post-closing adjustments and indemnification obligations, the aggregate consideration payable by the buyer will be $120.0 million in cash, the dollar value of specified inventory at a purchase price of standard cost plus 5% in cash, and the assumption of certain liabilities, as set forth in the asset purchase agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. 25 Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 $ Change % Change 2019 2018 $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 217.7 $ 274.4 $ (56.7 ) (20.7 %) $ 402.0 $ 537.1 $ (135.1 ) (25.2 %) PC product applications 81.6 63.9 17.7 27.7 % 149.4 132.5 16.9 12.8 % IoT product applications 89.0 87.2 1.8 2.1 % 176.8 173.5 3.3 1.9 % Net revenue 388.3 425.5 (37.2 ) (8.7 %) 728.2 843.1 (114.9 ) (13.6 %) Gross margin 159.3 149.8 9.5 6.3 % 285.5 290.7 (5.2 ) (1.8 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 77.0 84.2 (7.2 ) (8.6 %) 163.0 174.3 (11.3 ) (6.5 %) Selling, general, and administrative 31.5 35.6 (4.1 ) (11.5 %) 59.0 69.4 (10.4 ) (15.0 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 3.0 2.9 0.1 3.4 % 5.9 5.8 0.1 1.7 % Restructuring costs 13.3 2.1 11.2 533.3 % 19.9 10.4 9.5 91.3 % Operating income 34.5 25.0 9.5 38.0 % 37.7 30.8 6.9 22.4 % Interest and other expense, net (2.3 ) (4.3 ) 2.0 46.5 % (5.9 ) (6.2 ) 0.3 4.8 % Income/(loss) before provision/ (benefit) for income taxes 32.2 20.7 11.5 55.6 % 31.8 24.6 7.2 29.3 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes 12.0 7.5 4.5 60.0 % 7.1 7.2 (0.1 ) (1.4 %) Equity investment loss (0.4 ) (0.4 ) - 0.0 % (0.9 ) (0.8 ) (0.1 ) (12.5 %) Net income $ 19.8 $ 12.8 $ 7.0 54.7 % $ 23.8 $ 16.6 $ 7.2 43.4 % Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Six Months Ended Percentage Point December 31, Increase/ December 31, Increase/ 2019 2018 (Decrease) 2019 2018 (Decrease) Mobile product applications 56.1 % 64.5 % (8.4 %) 55.2 % 63.7 % (8.5 %) PC product applications 21.0 % 15.0 % 6.0 % 20.5 % 15.7 % 4.8 % IoT product applications 22.9 % 20.5 % 2.4 % 24.3 % 20.6 % 3.7 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 41.0 % 35.2 % 5.8 % 39.2 % 34.5 % 4.7 % Operating expenses: Research and development 19.8 % 19.8 % 0.0 % 22.4 % 20.7 % 1.7 % Selling, general, and administrative 8.1 % 8.4 % (0.3 %) 8.1 % 8.2 % (0.1 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 0.8 % 0.7 % 0.1 % 0.8 % 0.7 % 0.1 % Restructuring costs 3.4 % 0.5 % 2.9 % 2.7 % 1.2 % 1.5 % Operating income 8.9 % 5.9 % 3.0 % 5.2 % 3.7 % 1.5 % Interest and other expense, net (0.6 %) (1.0 %) 0.4 % (0.8 %) (0.7 %) (0.1 %) Income/(loss) before provision/ (benefit) for income taxes 8.3 % 4.9 % 3.4 % 4.4 % 2.9 % 1.5 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes 3.1 % 1.8 % 1.3 % 1.0 % 0.9 % 0.1 % Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income 5.1 % 3.0 % 2.1 % 3.3 % 2.0 % 1.3 % 26 Net Revenue Net revenue was $388.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with $425.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $37.2 million, or 8.7%. Of this net revenue, $217.7 million, or 56.1%, was from Mobile product applications, $89.0 million, or 22.9%, was from IoT product applications, and $81.6 million, or 21.0%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from PC product applications and IoT product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 18.4%) as well as slightly lower average selling prices for Mobile product applications. Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to a growth in units sold (which increased 13.9%) for PC product applications as well as higher average selling prices (which increased 12.1%). Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold, partially offset by lower average selling prices for IoT product applications. Net revenue was $728.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, compared with $843.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $114.9 million, or 13.6%. Of this net revenue, $402.0 million, or 55.2%, was from Mobile product applications, $176.8 million, or 24.3%, was from IoT product applications, and $149.4 million, or 20.5%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from PC product applications and IoT product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 24.9%) as well as slightly lower average selling prices for Mobile product applications. Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to higher average selling prices (which increased 12.8%). Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold, partially offset by lower average selling prices for IoT product applications. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 41.0%, or $159.3 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with 35.2%, or $149.8 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2018. The 580 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and a $6.9 million decrease in amortization for amortizable intangibles which are now fully amortized. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 39.2%, or $285.5 million, for the six months ended December 31, 2019, compared with 34.5%, or $290.7 million, for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The 470 basis point increase in gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to a favorable product mix and a $8.6 million decrease in amortization for amortizable intangibles which are now fully amortized. We continually introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product-specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $7.2 million to $77.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a net $1.9 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the three months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $1.9 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities; a $1.8 million decrease in non-employee services; and a $1.0 million decrease in travel related costs. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $2.0 million of retention program costs with key engineering and management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. Research and development expenses decreased $11.3 million to $163.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, compared with the six months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a net $3.7 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the six months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2018, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $3.0 million decrease in non-employee services; a $2.6 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities; a $2.1 million decrease in project related costs; a $1.7 million decrease in travel related costs; and a $1.2 million decrease in software licensing and maintenance costs. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $4.4 million of retention program costs with key engineering and management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. 27 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses de creased $4.1 million to $31.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 , compared with the three months ended December 31, 2018 . The de crease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a net $ 1.6 million de crease in personnel-related costs which was primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs ; a $1.2 million decrease in non-employee services; a $1.2 million decrease in bad debt expense; a $0.9 million decrease in travel related expenses; partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in legal fees . The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $ 1.5 million of retention program costs with key management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $10.4 million to $59.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, compared with the six months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a net $7.3 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $2.3 million decrease in non-employee services; a $1.5 million decrease in bad debt expense; a $1.4 million decrease in travel related expenses; partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in legal fees. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $2.8 million of retention program costs with key management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $19.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2019 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs, which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The restructuring activities are expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as impairment recovery on investments. Interest and other expense, net was relatively flat at $5.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $6.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018. Provision for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $12.0 million and $7.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The provision for income taxes of $7.1 million and $7.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily due to foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess share-based compensation deductions, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. 28 In June 2019 , the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. As our tax filing position is consistent with the T reasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. However, due to uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case . Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $424.8 million as of December 31, 2019, compared with $327.8 million as of June 30, 2019, an increase of $97.0 million. The increase primarily reflected $120.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $4.8 million of net proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $17.0 million used to repurchase 555,663 shares of our common stock, $8.2 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, and $2.5 million used for an asset acquisition completed in August 2019. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of December 31, 2019, $172.7 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2019 generated $120.0 million compared with $63.5 million net cash generated during the six months ended December 31, 2018. For the six months ended December 31, 2019, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $81.5 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $14.7 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $55.6 million decrease in inventory and a $15.1 million increase in accrued compensation, partially offset by a $30.0 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, a $16.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, and a decrease of $7.4 million in accounts payable. From June 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019, our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 57 days due to a larger percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2019 quarter compared with a smaller percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the December 31, 2019 quarter. Our annual inventory turns increased from five to eleven, which was driven by the classification of $20.9 million of inventory as current assets held for sale (which had an impact of 2 turns) as well as stronger product demand throughout the quarter. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $8.2 million for purchases of property and equipment and $2.5 million used for an asset acquisition completed in August 2019. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2019 was $12.2 million compared with $73.1 million used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2019 was related to $17.0 million used to repurchase 555,663 shares of our common stock. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2019, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through December 31, 2019, we purchased 31,489,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the six months ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 555,663 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $17.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $190.6 million. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC and the assets of Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.’s multimedia solutions business. 29 The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, or the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million are amortizing over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as approved by the Administrative Agent, which is currently anticipated to be the SOFR. 30 Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the Company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 1.3 $ 2.6 $ 527.6 $ — $ — $ — $ 531.5 Leases 4.7 8.6 5.8 3.8 2.5 1.8 27.2 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 38.5 13.0 — — — — 51.5 Transition tax payable (3) 0.9 0.9 0.9 1.8 2.4 3.0 9.9 Total $ 45.4 $ 25.1 $ 534.3 $ 5.6 $ 4.9 $ 4.8 $ 620.1 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation.

(3) Represents the remaining balance of the one-time transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $20.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 31 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December 31, 2019, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended December 28, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are no material changes to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2021. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $190.6 million. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, there were no repurchases under our common stock repurchase program. 33 ITEM 6.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2020 is a 52-week period ending June 27, 2020, and our fiscal 2019 was a 52-week period ending on June 29, 2019. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-weeks for the three months ended September 28, 2019, and September 29, 2018. For simplicity, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020, the quarter ended September 30, 2019, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-02, Leases, or Topic 842, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and resulted in net gains of $ 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and net losses of $ 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. 8 Leases We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within operating lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date. Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability. The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods when one of the triggering events outlined in Topic 842 occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Asset Acquisition We acquired an emerging technology startup company focused on the design of high-speed connectivity products in August 2019. The purchase price primarily included $ 2.5 million in cash paid at the closing, and up to $ 6.5 million in contingent consideration which is payable in set amounts upon meeting various milestones on dates from December 2021 through December 2023 . As of September 30, 2019, we have accrued $ 1.3 million of the contingent consideration as that is the portion which is currently estimable and probable. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase and accordingly we expensed $ 3.7 million of in-process research and development, recorded liabilities of approximately $ 1.5 million and recorded a long-term deferred tax asset of $ 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019. 2. Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On June 30, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted by ASC 842. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases The standard had a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet but did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. The adoption of this new standard at June 30, 2019, resulted in the following changes: • assets increased by $ 27.8 million, primarily representing the recognition of ROU assets for operating leases; and • liabilities increased by $ 28.4 million, primarily representing the recognition of lease liabilities for operating leases. 9 3. Revenue Recognition We adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, at the beginning of our fiscal 2019. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of application specific integrated circuit chips, or ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There was $ 1.0 million in contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2019 and $ 0.9 million as of June 30, 2019. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $ 6.4 million and $ 38.3 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2019, and $ 4.5 million and $ 47.5 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in Note 9 Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized $ 0.2 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of September 30, 2019, we did no t have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 10 4. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 4.0 $ 3.8 Denominator: Shares, basic 33.0 35.1 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 0.6 1.0 Shares, diluted 33.6 36.1 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.12 $ 0.11 Diluted $ 0.12 $ 0.11 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, deferred stock units, or DSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 1,340,521 and 1,357,565 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 5. Fair Value Our financial assets, measured at fair value on a recurring basis under the fair value hierarchy, consisted of money market funds within level 1 financial assets and totaled $ 331.0 million and $ 313.7 million as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. These money market funds were included in cash and cash equivalents in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. 6. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): September 30, June 30, 2019 2019 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 72.1 $ 110.7 Finished goods 66.1 48.0 $ 138.2 $ 158.7 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 11 7. Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 (in millions): September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ ( 155.9 ) $ 8.1 $ 164.0 $ ( 148.1 ) $ 15.9 Audio and video technology 5.3 138.6 ( 56.1 ) 82.5 138.6 ( 49.4 ) 89.2 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 ( 52.8 ) 29.0 81.8 ( 49.9 ) 31.9 Fingerprint authentication technology Not applicable — — — 47.2 ( 47.2 ) — Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 ( 4.1 ) 3.6 7.7 ( 3.6 ) 4.1 Patents 8.1 4.4 ( 2.2 ) 2.2 4.4 ( 2.0 ) 2.4 Tradename 7.0 1.8 ( 0.6 ) 1.2 1.8 ( 0.5 ) 1.3 Acquired intangibles, gross 4.9 $ 398.3 $ ( 271.7 ) $ 126.6 $ 445.5 $ ( 300.7 ) $ 144.8 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $ 18.2 million and $ 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, $ 15.3 million and $ 17.0 million, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of income in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of September 30, 2019 (in millions): Remainder of 2020 $ 33.2 2021 37.5 2022 32.9 2023 20.4 2024 2.5 2025 0.1 Future amortization $ 126.6 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There was no change in goodwill during the three months ended September 30, 2019. 12 8. Leases Our leases mainly include our worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2026 , some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years. For the quarter ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $ 2.3 million of operating lease expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases. As of September 30, 2019, the components of leases and lease costs are as follows (in millions): September 30, 2019 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 25.8 Operating lease liabilities $ 8.4 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 17.8 Total operating lease liabilities $ 26.2 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows $ 2.3 Supplemental non-cash information related to lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 2.0 As of September 30, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term is 3.8 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 4.21 %. Future minimum lease payments for the operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments Remainder of 2020 $ 7.0 2021 8.5 2022 5.7 2023 3.4 2024 2.0 Thereafter 1.7 Total future minimum operating lease payments 28.3 Less: interest ( 2.1 ) Total lease liabilities $ 26.2 13 As of the beginning of our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019, our aggregate minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in millions): Operating Lease Fiscal Year Payments 2020 $ 7.4 2021 3.2 2022 0.9 2023 0.3 2024 0.1 Total future minimum operating lease payments $ 11.9 9. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): September 30, June 30, 2019 2019 Customer Obligations $ 44.7 $ 52.0 Inventory obligations 26.8 26.7 Operating lease liabilities 8.4 — Warranty 4.0 4.0 Other 23.8 23.4 $ 107.7 $ 106.1 Other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): September 30, June 30, 2019 2019 Income taxes payable, long-term $ 16.4 $ 16.2 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 17.8 — Other 15.0 14.1 $ 49.2 $ 30.3 10. Indemnifications and Contingencies Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 14 11. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $ 514.5 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 % per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022 , or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $ 82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39 % and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50 % using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $ 11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount of $ 10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $ 579,000 , pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $ 1.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years . The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the three months ended September 30, 2019, were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Interest expense $ 0.7 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 4.5 Total interest $ 5.2 15 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of September 30, 2019 were $ 5.2 million and $ 47.0 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our prior term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $ 200 million, which includes a $ 20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $ 20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 , and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $ 2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65 % of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175 % to 0.25 % per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as approved by the Administrative Agent, which is currently anticipated to be Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $ 50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants . 16 12. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Cost of revenue $ 0.7 $ 0.9 Research and development 7.5 8.3 Selling, general, and administrative 3.0 7.5 Total $ 11.2 $ 16.7 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 0.9 $ 2.7 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Stock option activity were as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 1,191,929 $ 59.07 Granted — — Exercised ( 68,057 ) 24.54 Forfeited ( 75,300 ) 65.02 Balance as of September 30, 2019 1,048,572 60.88 $ 1.0 Exercisable at September 30, 2019 1,034,044 61.01 $ 1.0 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 27, 2019 of $ 39.62 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. Deferred Stock Units DSU activity were as follows: Aggregate DSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 1,878,853 Granted 200,417 Delivered ( 183,256 ) Forfeited ( 106,072 ) Balance as of September 30, 2019 1,789,942 $ 70.9 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 27, 2019 of $ 39.62 . Of the shares delivered, 42,740 shares valued at $ 1.5 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. 17 Market Stock Units Our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to certain of our employees. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018, and relative to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX Index, for grants made prior to fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR — {SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR}] x 2)) For MSUs vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100 % and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, MSU activity and balances as of September 30, 2019 was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 210,732 Granted 185,982 Forfeited ( 30,928 ) Balance as of September 30, 2019 365,786 $ 14.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 27, 2019 of $ 39.62 . We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $ 14.5 million as of September 30, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years. Performance Stock Units Our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. 18 We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65 % of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135 % of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, PSU activity and balances as of September 30, 2019 were as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2019 192,618 Forfeited ( 29,095 ) Balance as of September 30, 2019 163,523 $ 6.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on September 27, 2019 of $ 39.62 . We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $ 1.3 million as of September 30, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.8 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan There were no employee stock purchase plan purchases during the three-month period ended September 30, 2019. 13. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The benefit for income taxes of $ 4.9 million and $ 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess share-based compensation deductions, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and GILTI. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $ 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019, to $ 20.1 million from $ 18.9 million at June 30, 2019, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2019 were $ 1.7 million; this balance decreased by $ 0.2 million compared to June 30, 2019. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $ 2.5 million. 19 In June 2019 , the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. As our tax filing position is consistent with the T reasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required . H owever, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case . Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2013 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 examination by the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our case was reviewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which concluded in September 2019 with no further impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Mobile product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 China $ 176.8 $ 227.8 Taiwan 65.2 76.4 Japan 63.2 68.5 Other 16.5 15.4 South Korea 16.4 20.1 United States 1.8 9.4 $ 339.9 $ 417.6 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Mobile product applications $ 184.3 $ 262.7 PC product applications 67.8 68.6 IoT product applications 87.8 86.3 $ 339.9 $ 417.6 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Customer A 12 % 11 % Customer B 12 % * Customer C * 17 % * Less than 10 % 20 We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: September 30, June 30, 2019 2019 Customer A 19 % 25 % Customer B 13 % * Customer C 11 % 16 % * Less than 10 % 15. Comprehensive Income Our comprehensive income generally consists of net income plus the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments, primarily due to temporary changes in market value of certain of our auction rate securities, or ARS, investments. In addition, we recognize the noncredit portion of other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in other comprehensive income. We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of income as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 16. Restructuring Activities In August 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring of our mobile fingerprint optical business. The costs for this restructuring activity primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount and related costs. These activities were complete as of June 30, 2019. In June 2019, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to reduce our operating cost structure further. The costs for this restructuring action primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount. Restructuring costs related to these fiscal 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our consolidated statements of income. We expect to complete activities relating to the June 2019 restructuring action in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The restructuring liability for the fiscal 2019 initiated activity during fiscal 2019 and the three months ended September 30, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 17.7 Cash payments ( 12.5 ) Balance as of June 30, 2019 5.2 Accruals 6.6 Cash payments ( 6.8 ) Balance as of September 30, 2019 $ 5.0 21 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2019 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). For ease of presentation, this Report shows reporting periods ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, products which include smart devices with voice, speech and video solutions, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. The solutions we deliver either contain or consist of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, or video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, customer-specific firmware, and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. 22 Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs ’ commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions , which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as impairment recovery on investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 184.3 $ 262.7 $ (78.4 ) (29.8 %) PC product applications 67.8 68.6 (0.8 ) (1.2 %) IoT product applications 87.8 86.3 1.5 1.7 % Net revenue 339.9 417.6 (77.7 ) (18.6 %) Gross margin 126.2 140.9 (14.7 ) (10.4 %) Operating expenses: Research and development 86.0 90.0 (4.0 ) (4.4 %) Selling, general, and administrative 27.5 33.9 (6.4 ) (18.9 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.9 2.9 — 0.0 % Restructuring costs 6.6 8.3 (1.7 ) (20.5 %) Operating income 3.2 5.8 (2.6 ) (44.8 %) Interest and other expense, net (3.6 ) (1.9 ) (1.7 ) (89.5 %) Income/(loss) before provision/(benefit) for income taxes (0.4 ) 3.9 (4.3 ) (110.3 %) Provision/(benefit) for income taxes (4.9 ) (0.3 ) (4.6 ) (1533.3 %) Equity investment loss (0.5 ) (0.4 ) (0.1 ) (25.0 %) Net income $ 4.0 $ 3.8 $ 0.2 5.3 % 23 Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of income presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows : Three Months Ended Percentage Point September 30, Increase/ 2019 2018 (Decrease) Mobile product applications 54.3 % 62.9 % (8.6 %) PC product applications 19.9 % 16.4 % 3.5 % IoT product applications 25.8 % 20.7 % 5.1 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 37.1 % 33.7 % 3.4 % Operating expenses: Research and development 25.3 % 21.6 % 3.7 % Selling, general, and administrative 8.1 % 8.1 % 0.0 % Acquired intangibles amortization 0.9 % 0.7 % 0.2 % Restructuring costs 1.9 % 2.0 % (0.1 %) Operating income 0.9 % 1.4 % (0.5 %) Interest and other expense, net (1.1 %) (0.5 %) (0.6 %) Income/(loss) before provision/(benefit) for income taxes (0.1 %) 0.9 % (1.0 %) Provision/(benefit) for income taxes (1.4 %) (0.1 %) (1.3 %) Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income 1.2 % 0.9 % 0.3 % Net Revenue Net revenue was $339.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $417.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, a decrease of $77.7 million, or 18.6%. Of this net revenue, $184.3 million, or 54.3%, was from Mobile product applications, $87.8 million, or 25.8%, was from IoT product applications, and $67.8 million, or 19.9%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications and PC product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from IoT product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 31.0%), partially offset by higher average selling prices for Mobile product applications. Net revenue from PC product applications decreased due to a decline in units sold for PC product applications, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net revenue from IoT product applications increased as a result of a higher average selling prices for IoT product applications, partially offset by a decline in units sold. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 37.1%, or $126.2 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with 33.7%, or $140.9 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The 340 basis point increase in gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was primarily due to a favorable product mix. We continually introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product-specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. 24 Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $4.0 million to $86.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a net $2.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $2.4 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities; and a $1.8 million decrease in supplies and project specific costs, partially offset by acquired in-process research and development of $3.7 million. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $2.5 million of retention program costs with key engineering and management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $6.4 million to $27.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a net $6.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of restructuring activities to reduce operating costs. The decrease in personnel-related costs was partially offset by $1.3 million of retention program costs with key management employees designed to ensure operational continuity and support as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 7 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $6.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The restructuring activities are expected to be complete in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. See Note 16 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as impairment recovery on investments. The $1.7 million increase in interest and other expense, net to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to a $2.8 million impairment recovery on investments recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Provision for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The benefit for income taxes of $4.9 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits and foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess share-based compensation deductions, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and GILTI. In June 2019, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, no adjustment to our financial statements is required. However, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $350.8 million as of September 30, 2019, compared with $327.8 million as of June 30, 2019, an increase of $23.0 million. The increase primarily reflected $47.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $17.0 million used to repurchase 555,663 shares of our common stock, $5.0 million used for the purchase of property and equipment and $2.5 million used for an asset acquisition completed in August 2019. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax incurred as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of September 30, 2019, $133.0 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2019 generated $47.3 million compared with $4.6 million net cash generated during the three months ended September 30, 2018. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $43.0 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.3 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $20.5 million decrease in inventory, partially offset by a $9.4 million decrease in income taxes payable and a $9.2 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. From June 30, 2019 to September 30, 2019, our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 61 days due to a larger percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2019 quarter compared with a smaller percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the September 30, 2019 quarter. Our annual inventory turns increased from five to six. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2019 consisted of $5.0 million for purchases of property and equipment and $2.5 million used for an asset acquisition completed in August 2019. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $16.8 million compared with $38.2 million provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily related to $17.0 million used to repurchase 555,663 shares of our common stock. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2019, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.4 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2021. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through September 30, 2019, we purchased 31,489,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 555,663 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $17.0 million. As of September 30, 2019, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $190.6 million. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC and the assets of Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.’s multimedia solutions business. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. 26 Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, or the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million are amortizing over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as approved by the Administrative Agent, which is currently anticipated to be SOFR. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. 27 $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the Company , in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, and our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 30, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 2.6 $ 2.6 $ 527.6 $ — $ — $ — $ 532.8 Leases 7.0 8.5 5.7 3.4 2.0 1.7 28.3 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 43.6 13.0 — — — — 56.6 Transition tax payable (3) 0.9 0.9 0.9 1.8 2.4 3.0 9.9 Total $ 54.1 $ 25.0 $ 534.2 $ 5.2 $ 4.4 $ 4.7 $ 627.6 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $20.1 million. As of September 30, 2019, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 28 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of September 30, 2019, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 842, Leases, on the first day of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, or June 30, 2019. As a result, we have enhanced our processes and controls to address the new lease standard. Other than that, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 29 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are no material changes to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019.

INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2019 is a 52-week period ending June 29, 2019, and our fiscal 2018 was a 53-week period ending on June 30, 2018. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week and 39-week periods for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019, respectively, and 13-week and 40-week periods for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. For simplicity, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and resulted in net losses of $0.1 million and $0.7 million in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 and net losses of $0.3 million and $0.8 million in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. 2. Revenue Recognition Change in Accounting Policy In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, on revenue from contracts with customers, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. 9 We adopted the new revenue standard at the beginning of our fiscal 2019, using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods ending after our fiscal 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior reporting periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous revenue standard. Recognition of revenue ha s remained substantially unchanged under the new revenue standard as compared to t he previous revenue standard. Accordingly, there was no adjustment to the fiscal 2019 opening retained earnings. However, due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, we reclassified certain amounts of incentive items to other accrued liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 , and presented them as part of customer obligations, from the contra accounts receivable. Such information is as f ollows (in millions): Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets As of March 31, 2019 Pro forma as if As reported under previous standard new standard Adjustments was in effect Accounts receivable, net $ 266.8 $ (4.8 ) $ 262.0 Total assets 1,468.6 (4.8 ) 1,463.8 Other accrued liabilities 99.1 (4.8 ) 94.3 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity 1,468.6 (4.8 ) 1,463.8 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 Pro forma as if As reported under previous standard new standard Adjustments was in effect Cash flows from operating activities: Accounts receivable, net $ 27.5 $ (0.4 ) $ 27.1 Other accrued liabilities 13.6 0.4 14.0 Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. 10 Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, pr ice protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in Note 7 Other Accrued Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there wil l be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recog nized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expe nses and other current assets . In limited circumstances , we enter into volume based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in the periods presented. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $5.5 million and $42.3 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2019 and $1.1 million and $31.6 million, respectively, as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in Note 7 Other Accrued Liabilities. During the nine months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized $0.3 million in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of March 31, 2019, we did not have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606-10-50-14, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income/(loss) $ 6.7 $ (13.7 ) $ 23.3 $ (122.6 ) Denominator: Shares, basic 34.4 34.5 34.7 34.0 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 0.6 — 0.8 — Shares, diluted 35.0 34.5 35.5 34.0 Net income/(loss) per share: Basic $ 0.19 $ (0.40 ) $ 0.67 $ (3.61 ) Diluted $ 0.19 $ (0.40 ) $ 0.66 $ (3.61 ) 11 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, deferred stock units, or DSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our conve rtible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 1,558,936 and 2,818,358 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 1,434,049 and 2,427,566 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the nine months ended March 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Fair Value Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy, consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, June 30, 2019 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Money market funds $ 309.5 $ - $ - $ 275.2 $ - $ - Auction rate securities - - - - - 1.5 Total available-for-sale securities $ 309.5 $ - $ - $ 275.2 $ - $ 1.5 In our condensed consolidated balance sheets, as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, money market balances were included in cash and cash equivalents and as of June 30, 2018, auction rate securities, or ARS investments, were included in non-current other assets. During the nine months ended March 31, 2019, we converted our ARS investments to senior surplus notes, under an offering memorandum, which also included a receipt of a small amount of cash and warrants. We sold the senior surplus notes during the nine months ended March 31, 2019, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million. There were no transfers in or out of our Level 1, 2, or 3 assets during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, June 30, 2019 2018 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 121.8 $ 105.0 Finished goods 31.3 26.2 $ 153.1 $ 131.2 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 12 6. Acquired Intangib les and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ (140.2 ) $ 23.8 $ 164.0 $ (116.5 ) $ 47.5 Audio and video technology 5.3 138.6 (42.5 ) 96.1 133.9 (22.8 ) 111.1 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 (47.1 ) 34.7 81.8 (38.5 ) 43.3 Fingerprint authentication technology 4.7 47.2 (47.2 ) - 55.7 (53.7 ) 2.0 Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 (3.1 ) 4.6 9.0 (3.0 ) 6.0 Patents 8.1 4.4 (1.9 ) 2.5 4.6 (1.7 ) 2.9 Tradename 7.0 1.8 (0.4 ) 1.4 1.9 (0.2 ) 1.7 Backlog - - - - 0.5 (0.5 ) - In-process research and development Not applicable - - - 4.7 - 4.7 Acquired intangibles, gross 4.4 $ 445.5 $ (282.4 ) $ 163.1 $ 456.1 $ (236.9 ) $ 219.2 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $18.1 million and $18.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $56.1 million and $62.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, $15.2 million and $17.2 million, respectively, and $47.3 million and $53.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of March 31, 2019 (in millions): Remainder of 2019 $ 18.3 2020 51.4 2021 37.5 2022 32.9 2023 20.4 2024 2.5 Thereafter 0.1 Future amortization $ 163.1 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There were no changes in our goodwill balance for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. 13 7. Other Accrued Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, June 30, 2019 2018 Customer Obligations $ 47.8 $ 26.4 Inventory obligations 30.1 28.8 Warranty 4.0 5.5 Other 17.2 19.0 $ 99.1 $ 79.7 Our customer obligations included $5.5 million of contract liabilities and $42.3 million of refund liabilities as of March 31, 2019, each as defined under revenue recognition guidance in the new revenue standard (see Note 2 Revenue Recognition). We reclassified certain amounts of incentive items to other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, and presented them as part of customer obligations, from the contra accounts receivable due to the adoption of the new revenue standard . 8. Indemnifications, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 9. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $514.5 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. 14 The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). T he conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39% and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50% using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the initial purchaser’s discount of $10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $579,000, pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $1.9 million and $9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years. The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, were as follows (in millions): Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 Interest expense $ 2.0 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 13.1 Total interest $ 15.1 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of March 31, 2019 were $6.1 million and $55.0 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our prior term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 15 The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unus ed commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants. 10. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Cost of revenue $ 0.7 $ 0.9 $ 2.4 $ 2.3 Research and development 8.6 10.0 25.4 28.9 Selling, general, and administrative 6.5 7.9 20.9 21.9 Total $ 15.8 $ 18.8 $ 48.7 $ 53.1 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation $ 1.8 $ 3.7 $ 4.2 $ 6.4 Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. Stock Options Stock option activity, including stock options granted, exercised, and forfeited, weighted average exercise prices for stock options outstanding and exercisable, and the aggregate intrinsic value were as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 1,618,209 $ 57.14 Granted - - Exercised (167,663 ) 29.34 Forfeited (137,323 ) 66.93 Balance as of March 31, 2019 1,313,223 59.67 $ 2.2 Exercisable at March 31, 2019 1,231,738 60.09 $ 2.2 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 29, 2019 of $39.75 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. 16 Deferred Stock Units DSU activity, including DSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of DSUs were as follows: Aggregate DSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 1,853,558 Granted 1,227,652 Delivered (670,770 ) Forfeited (288,773 ) Balance as of March 31, 2019 2,121,667 $ 84.3 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 29, 2019 of $39.75. Of the shares delivered, 158,868 shares valued at $6.2 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; and the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018, and relative to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX Index, for grants made prior to fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR — {SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR}] x 2)) The payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100% and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. 17 Dur ing the nine months ended March 31, 2019 , MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of March 31, 2019 was as follows : Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 354,726 Granted 163,059 Performance adjustment (46,663 ) Delivered (92,202 ) Forfeited (53,115 ) Balance as of March 31, 2019 325,805 $ 13.0 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 29, 2019 of $39.75. Of the shares delivered, 33,981 shares valued at $1.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year performance and service period on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $13.0 million as of March 31, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Performance Stock Units Our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65% of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135% of target. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. During the nine months ended March 31, 2019, PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of March 31, 2019 was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 294,541 Granted 147,005 Performance adjustment 1,065 Delivered (92,470 ) Forfeited (54,383 ) Balance as of March 31, 2019 295,758 $ 11.8 18 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on March 29, 2019 of $39.75. Of the shares delivered, 36,332 shares valued at $1.4 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $4.6 million as of March 31, 2019, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the nine-month period ended March 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average purchase price): . Shares purchased 258,563 Weighted average purchase price $ 31.60 Cash received $ 8.2 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 1.4 11. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Act, which significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Act contains broad and complex changes to corporate taxation, including, in part, reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. U.S. federal tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that spans the effective date of a tax rate change to calculate a blended tax rate based on the pro rata number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. As our accounting and tax year is the fiscal period ending on the last Saturday in June, our U.S. federal tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a days-weighted blended tax rate of 28.17%. For fiscal 2019 and subsequent tax years, our U.S. federal tax rate is 21%. In fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $41.4 million, related to the tax impact of the Act, of which an expense of $44.1 million relates to the one-time transition tax and a benefit of $2.7 million relates to remeasurement of deferred tax at the new tax rate. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 foreign earnings and profits, or E&P, which we previously excluded from U.S. income taxes as we considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. The one-time transition tax is applied at a 15.5% tax rate on cash assets and an 8% tax rate for other specified assets. We were able to utilize the research credit carryforward, resulting in a net one-time transition tax impact of $11.9 million on the income tax payable. During the quarter ended December 31, 2018, based on additional analysis of technical guidance, we recognized a non-discrete tax expense of $1.4 million, which is included in the annual effective tax rate, and a discrete benefit of $0.2 million, both of which relate to the limitation on deduction of executive officer compensation. Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts and recognize the effect of the tax law during a measurement period. The measurement period ended in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. As of March 31, 2019, we have finalized our accounting for the tax impact of the Act and there were no material adjustments recorded to our provisional amounts. However, further technical guidance related to the Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued and, as such, if our interpretation and final accounting are inconsistent with future regulations and guidance, we will recognize the impact as a discrete item in the period that such guidance is issued. The Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or GILTI, which is a provision under the Act, imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. GILTI requires an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred, or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We elected to treat GILTI as a period cost and recognize the impact in the period when it is incurred. 19 We account for income taxes under the asset and liab ility method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The benefit for income taxes of $15.3 million and $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the impact of the benefit of research credits and excess share-based compensation deductions, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates. The benefit for income taxes of $8.1 million and provision for income taxes of $52.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deduction, foreign tax credits and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the impact of the one-time transition tax on E&P, the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate on our net deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, partially offset by benefits from research credits. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions increased $0.5 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2019, to $25.3 million from $24.8 million at June 30, 2018, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2019 were $2.7 million; this balance increased by $0.8 million compared to June 30, 2018. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes includes an increase in our liability of up to $3.9 million. In July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion. The reconstituted panel has not issued an opinion on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2013 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and 2015 examination by the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our case is pending review by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which we anticipate will conclude in June 2019. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. 20 12. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the Mobile product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Internet of Things, or IoT, product market. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 China $ 190.0 $ 204.9 $ 669.5 $ 624.6 Japan 58.4 87.6 204.9 275.9 Taiwan 47.6 53.2 185.0 156.5 Other 19.6 18.7 48.9 56.5 South Korea 13.8 15.5 45.6 49.2 United States 4.6 14.1 23.2 79.1 $ 334.0 $ 394.0 $ 1,177.1 $ 1,241.8 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Mobile product applications $ 204.7 $ 244.8 $ 741.8 $ 799.5 PC product applications 66.2 60.2 198.7 187.2 IoT product applications 63.1 89.0 236.6 255.1 $ 334.0 $ 394.0 $ 1,177.1 $ 1,241.8 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Customer A 17% 17% 18% 16% Customer B 10% 11% * 11% Customer C 16% 11% 14% * * Less than 10% We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: March 31, June 30, 2019 2018 Customer A 20% 13% Customer B 19% 10% Customer C * 11% * Less than 10% 13. Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Our comprehensive income/(loss) generally consists of net income/(loss) plus the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments, primarily due to temporary changes in market value of certain of our ARS investments. In addition, we recognize the noncredit portion of other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in other comprehensive income/(loss). We recognize foreign 21 currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 14. Restructuring Activities In November 2017, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to streamline and reduce our operating cost structure and capitalize on acquisition synergies. These costs primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount, facility consolidation and related costs. In April 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring to close a research and development facility. These costs included employee severance and related benefits and facility closure charges. Restructuring costs related to the November 2017 and April 2018 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations and are complete as of March 31, 2019. The restructuring liability for these fiscal 2018 initiated activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance Facility Consolidation and Benefits and Related Charges Total Balance as of June 30, 2018 $ 2.2 $ 0.1 $ 2.3 Accruals 0.2 - 0.2 Cash payments (2.4 ) (0.1 ) (2.5 ) Balance as of March 31, 2019 $ - $ - $ - In August 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring of our mobile fingerprint optical business. These costs primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount and related costs. Restructuring costs related to the fiscal 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations. These activities are complete as of March 31, 2019. The restructuring liability for the fiscal 2019 initiated activity during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 10.4 Cash payments (10.4 ) Balance as of March 31, 2019 $ — 22 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). For ease of presentation, this Report shows reporting periods ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.

Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, which includes devices with voice, speech and video within smart homes, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. Every solution we deliver either contains or consists of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, and video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, customer-specific firmware, and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs, and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. 23 Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and hu man interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, a nd to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by impairment recovery on investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, with the exception to the critical accounting policy on revenue recognition. We adopted the Accounting Standards Update on revenue from contracts with customers at the beginning of our fiscal 2019 (see Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report). 24 Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 (1) 2018 (1) $ Change % Change 2019 (1) 2018 (1) $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 204.7 $ 244.8 $ (40.1 ) (16.4 %) $ 741.8 $ 799.5 $ (57.7 ) (7.2 %) PC product applications 66.2 60.2 6.0 10.0 % 198.7 187.2 11.5 6.1 % IoT product applications 63.1 89.0 (25.9 ) (29.1 %) 236.6 255.1 (18.5 ) (7.3 %) Net revenue 334.0 394.0 (60.0 ) (15.2 %) 1,177.1 1,241.8 (64.7 ) (5.2 %) Gross margin 116.0 122.9 (6.9 ) (5.6 %) 406.7 352.5 54.2 15.4 % Operating expenses: Research and development 82.6 93.7 (11.1 ) (11.8 %) 256.9 273.0 (16.1 ) (5.9 %) Selling, general, and administrative 34.2 37.9 (3.7 ) (9.8 %) 103.6 115.6 (12.0 ) (10.4 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 3.0 1.4 1.6 114.3 % 8.8 8.5 0.3 3.5 % Restructuring costs - 2.2 (2.2 ) (100.0 %) 10.4 8.6 1.8 20.9 % Operating income/(loss) (3.8 ) (12.3 ) 8.5 69.1 % 27.0 (53.2 ) 80.2 150.8 % Interest and other expense, net (4.3 ) (4.7 ) 0.4 8.5 % (10.5 ) (15.4 ) 4.9 31.8 % Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes (8.1 ) (17.0 ) 8.9 52.4 % 16.5 (68.6 ) 85.1 124.1 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes (15.3 ) (3.9 ) (11.4 ) (292.3 %) (8.1 ) 52.6 (60.7 ) (115.4 %) Equity investment loss (0.5 ) (0.6 ) 0.1 16.7 % (1.3 ) (1.4 ) 0.1 7.1 % Net income/(loss) $ 6.7 $ (13.7 ) $ 20.4 148.9 % $ 23.3 $ (122.6 ) $ 145.9 119.0 % (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from our acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC, completed on July 25, 2017, or the Conexant Acquisition, and from our acquisition of the multimedia solutions business of Marvell Technology Group Ltd., completed on September 8, 2017, or the Marvell Business Acquisition. Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of operations presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Nine Months Ended Percentage Point March 31, Increase/ March 31, Increase/ 2019 (1) 2018 (1) (Decrease) 2019 (1) 2018 (1) (Decrease) Mobile product applications 61.3 % 62.1 % (0.8 %) 63.0 % 64.4 % (1.4 %) PC product applications 19.8 % 15.3 % 4.5 % 16.9 % 15.1 % 1.8 % IoT product applications 18.9 % 22.6 % (3.7 %) 20.1 % 20.5 % (0.4 %) Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % Gross margin 34.7 % 31.2 % 3.5 % 34.6 % 28.4 % 6.2 % Operating expenses: Research and development 24.7 % 23.8 % 0.9 % 21.8 % 22.0 % (0.2 %) Selling, general, and administrative 10.2 % 9.6 % 0.6 % 8.8 % 9.3 % (0.5 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 0.9 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.0 % Restructuring costs 0.0 % 0.6 % (0.6 %) 0.9 % 0.7 % 0.2 % Operating income/(loss) (1.1 %) (3.1 %) 2.0 % 2.3 % (4.3 %) 6.6 % Interest and other expense, net (1.3 %) (1.2 %) (0.1 %) (0.9 %) (1.2 %) 0.3 % Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes (2.4 %) (4.3 %) 1.9 % 1.4 % (5.5 %) 6.9 % Provision/(benefit) for income taxes (4.6 %) (1.0 %) (3.6 %) (0.7 %) 4.2 % (4.9 %) Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.2 %) 0.1 % (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income/(loss) 2.0 % (3.5 %) 5.5 % 2.0 % (9.9 %) 11.9 % (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from the Conexant Acquisition, completed on July 25, 2017, and from the Marvell Business Acquisition, completed on September 8, 2017. 25 Net Revenue Net revenue was $334.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with $394.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $60.0 million, or 15.2%. Of this net revenue, $204.7 million, or 61.3%, was from Mobile product applications, $63.1 million, or 18.9%, was from IoT product applications, and $66.2 million, or 19.8%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications and IoT product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 31.0%), partially offset by higher average selling prices for Mobile product applications (which increased 21.2%). Net revenue from IoT product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 24.2%) and lower average selling prices for IoT product applications (which decreased 6.4%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to higher average selling prices (which increased 27.3%), partially offset by a decline in units sold for PC product applications (which decreased 13.6%). Net revenue was $1,177.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared with $1,241.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $64.7 million, or 5.2%. Of this net revenue, $741.8 million, or 63.0% was from Mobile product applications, $236.6 million, or 20.1%, was from IoT product applications, and $198.7 million, or 16.9%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, was attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications and IoT product applications, partially offset by an increase in PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 23.8%), partially offset by higher average selling prices for Mobile product applications (which increased 21.7%). Net revenue from IoT product applications decreased primarily as a result of lower average selling prices (which decreased 8.1%), partially offset by an increase in units sold (which increased 0.9%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased as a result of higher average selling prices (which increased 21.1%), partially offset by a decline in units sold (which decreased 12.4%). Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34.7%, or $116.0 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with 31.2%, or $122.9 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34.6%, or $406.7 million, for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, compared with 28.4%, or $352.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The 350 basis point increase and the 620 basis point increase in gross margin for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, was primarily due to a reduction of inventory fair value adjustments recorded in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 of $4.1 million and $38.0 million, respectively, associated with the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition; a reduction in acquired intangibles amortization that was charged to cost of revenue by $2.0 million and $6.1 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2018 and a favorable mix, including IoT product applications which have higher gross margins. There were no inventory fair value adjustments recorded in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019. We regularly introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product-specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $11.1 million to $82.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $7.9 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $1.6 million decrease in supplies and project specific costs; and a $0.8 million decrease in travel and related costs. Research and development expenses decreased $16.1 million to $256.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $10.4 million decrease in personnel-related costs which was due to a decrease in average headcount for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $5.8 million decrease in supplies and project specific costs and a $2.1 million decrease in facilities and infrastructure related costs; partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in software licensing and intellectual property costs. 26 Selling, Gene ral, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses de creased $3.7 million to $34.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , compared with the three months ended March 31, 2018 . The de crease in selling, general, and ad ministrative expenses primarily reflected a $2. 3 million decrease in professional fees and a $ 0.5 million de crease in personnel-related costs which was primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our recent restructuring activities to reduce operating costs , partially offset by costs associated with the termination of our former Chief Executive Officer, or CEO , in March 2019, which costs included an accrual of $ 2.2 million in severance related costs . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $12.0 million to $103.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses reflected a $12.7 million decrease in personnel-related costs, primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce operating costs which was partially offset by costs associated with the termination of our former CEO in March 2019, which costs included an accrual of $2.2 million in severance related costs; a $3.6 million reduction in professional fees and a $1.6 million, net, reversal of an accrual for payroll deposit penalties, which were previously accrued and have been reversed due to the completion of a payroll tax audit; partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in facilities and infrastructure related costs. Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 6 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $10.4 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs which commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The restructuring activities were complete as of March 31, 2019. See Note 14 Restructuring Activities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and Other Expense, Net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt. The $4.9 million decrease in interest and other expense, net to $10.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to a $2.8 million impairment recovery on investments as well as a $1.0 million reduction of amortization of debt issuance costs for a term loan which was paid down and closed in the prior fiscal year. See Liquidity and Capital Resources included in the next section of this Report. Provision for Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Act, which significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Act contains broad and complex changes to corporate taxation, including, in part, reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. U.S. federal tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that spans the effective date of a tax rate change to calculate a blended tax rate based on the pro rata number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. As our accounting and tax year is the fiscal period ending on the last Saturday in June, our U.S. federal tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a days-weighted blended tax rate of 28.17%. For fiscal 2019 and subsequent tax years, our U.S. federal tax rate is 21%. In fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $41.4 million, related to the tax impact of the Act, of which an expense of $44.1 million relates to the one-time transition tax and a benefit of $2.7 million relates to remeasurement of deferred tax at the new tax rate. The one-time transition tax was based on our post-1986 foreign earnings and profits, or E&P, which we previously excluded from U.S. income taxes as we considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. The one-time transition tax was applied at a 15.5% tax rate on cash assets and an 8% tax rate for other specified assets. We were able to utilize the research credit carryforward, resulting in a net one-time transition tax impact of $11.9 million on the income tax payable. During our second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, based on additional analysis of technical guidance, we recognized a non-discrete tax expense of $1.4 million, which was included in the annual effective tax rate, and a discrete benefit of $0.2 million, both of which relate to the limitation on deduction of executive officer compensation. Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts and recognize the effect of the tax law during a measurement period. The measurement period ended in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. As of March 31, 2019, we have finalized our accounting for the tax impact of the Act and there were no material adjustments recorded in our provisional amounts. However, further technical guidance related to the Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued and, as such, if our interpretation and final accounting are inconsistent with future regulations and guidance, we will recognize the impact as a discrete item in the period that such guidance is issued. 27 The Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or GILTI, which is a provision under the Act, imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tang ible assets of foreign corporations. GILTI requires an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We elected to treat GILTI as a current period cost and recognize the impact in the period when it is incurred. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The benefit for income taxes of $15.3 million and $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed-paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the impact of the benefit of research credits and excess share-based compensation deductions, partially offset by foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates. The benefit for income taxes of $8.1 million and provision for income taxes of $52.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, foreign deemed paid taxes, foreign income taxed at higher tax rates and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deduction, foreign tax credits and foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of the impact of the one-time transition tax on E&P, the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate on our net deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, partially offset by benefits from research credits. In July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion. The reconstituted panel has not issued an opinion on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $323.8 million as of March 31, 2019, compared with $301.0 million as of June 30, 2018, an increase of $22.8 million. The increase primarily reflected $110.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $77.3 million used to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock and $17.7 million used for the purchase of property and equipment. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax described above under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Provision for Income Taxes,” that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of March 31, 2019, $254.9 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 generated $110.8 million compared with $137.1 million net cash generated during the nine months ended March 31, 2018. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $130.2 million, partially offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $42.7 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $35.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $21.9 million increase in inventory, a $6.8 million reduction in acquisition related obligations; and a $9.6 million reduction in income taxes payable; partially offset by a $27.5 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $13.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities. From June 30, 2018 to March 31, 2019, our days sales outstanding increased 28 from 67 days to 72 days due to a larger percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring lat e in the March 31, 2019 quarter compared with a smaller percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2018 quarter. Our annual inventory turns declined from seven to five . For the nine months ended March 31, 201 8 , the primary opera ting activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $ 176.2 million ; a $ 83.5 million net change in operating assets and liabilities , partially offset by a net loss of $ 122.6 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $ 102.2 million de crease in inventory; a $20.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets; a nd an $ 8.2 million de crease in accounts receivable, net; partially offset by a $ 15.9 million decrease in accounts payable; a $ 15 .4 million decrease in accrued compensation; a n $11.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and a $ 7.2 million decrease in other assets . From June 30, 2017 to March 31, 2018 , our days sales outstanding in creased slightly from 54 days to 5 9 days. Ou r annual inventory turns remained flat at nine over this same period . Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 consisted of $17.7 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds from sales of investments. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 consisted of $396.4 million used for the acquisition of businesses; $27.5 million for the purchase of property and equipment; and $7.7 million for the purchase of intangible assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 was $73.1 million compared with $210.0 million provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily related to $77.3 million used to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 primarily related to $514.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt, partially offset by $220.0 million used for the payment of debt, and $93.6 million used to repurchase 1,698,400 shares of our common stock. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of March 31, 2019, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2019. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases are based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through March 31, 2019, we purchased 29,489,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. Treasury shares purchased prior to August 28, 2008 were not subject to the stock split on that date. During the nine months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased 1,850,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $77.3 million. As of March 31, 2019, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program was $148.8 million. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which included proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant Acquisition and Marvell Business Acquisition. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest has accrued since June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. 29 The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, or the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million are amortizing over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our Company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our Company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash 30 requirements for at least the next 12 months, and our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will dep end on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectua l property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the contin uing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acce ptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2019 Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 1.3 $ 2.6 $ 2.6 $ 527.6 $ - $ - $ - $ 534.1 Leases 3.0 7.6 3.0 0.9 0.3 0.1 - 14.9 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 36.0 16.5 6.2 - - - - 58.7 Transition tax payable (3) - 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.8 5.1 10.9 Total $ 40.3 $ 27.7 $ 12.8 $ 529.5 $ 1.3 $ 1.9 $ 5.1 $ 618.6 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $25.3 million. As of March 31, 2019, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 31 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board established Topic 842, Leases (or Topic 842), by issuing an Accounting Standard Update (or ASU) on Leases. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by several ASUs. The new standard requires organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. It also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The standard is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach and allows for the adoption of the standard to be applied at the beginning of the most recent fiscal year or at the beginning of the earliest year presented. We expect to adopt this ASU at the beginning of our fiscal year 2020, on June 30, 2019. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition and we expect to elect the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We also expect to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient, however, we do not expect to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements as it is not applicable to us. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and currently expect that our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities upon adoption of this standard, which will increase the total assets and total liabilities that are reported relative to such amounts prior to adoption. 32 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March 31, 2019, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Variable Interest Rate Risk As of March 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement, which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer, and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 33 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For further information regarding current legal proceedings, see Note 8 Indemnifications, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are no material changes to the Company’s risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities As announced on July 24, 2017, our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which expires at the end of July 2019. As of March 31, 2019, the remaining amount authorized for the repurchase of our common stock was $148.8 million. There were no repurchases under our common stock repurchase program during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019. 34 IT EM 6.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. In our opinion, the financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. Our fiscal 2019 is a 52-week period ending June 29, 2019, and our fiscal 2018 was a 53-week period ending on June 30, 2018. The fiscal periods presented in this report are 13-week and 26-week periods for the three and six months ended December 29, 2018, respectively, and 13-week and 27-week periods for the three and six months ended December 30, 2017, respectively. For simplicity, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Foreign Currency Transactions and Foreign Exchange Contracts The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. Our foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and resulted in net losses of $0.2 million and $0.6 million in the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 and net losses of $0.2 million and $0.5 million in the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. 2. Revenue Recognition Change in Accounting Policy In May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, on revenue from contracts with customers, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. 7 We adopted the new revenue standard at the beginning of our fiscal 2019, using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods ending after our fiscal 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior reporting periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous revenue standard. Recognition of revenue has remained substantially unchanged under the new revenue standard as that under the previous revenue standard. Accordingly, there was no adjustment to the fiscal 2019 opening retained earnings. However, we reclassified certain amounts of incentive items to other accrued liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of De cember 31, 2018, and presented them as part of customer obligations, from the contra accounts receivable due to the adoption of the new revenue standard . Such information is as follows (in millions): Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets As of December 31, 2018 Pro forma as if As reported under previous standard new standard Adjustments was in effect Accounts receivable, net $ 326.0 $ (5.1 ) $ 320.9 Total assets 1,499.6 (5.1 ) 1,494.5 Other accrued liabilities 91.9 (5.1 ) 86.8 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity 1,499.6 (5.1 ) 1,494.5 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 Pro forma as if As reported under previous standard new standard Adjustments was in effect Cash flows from operating activities: Accounts receivable, net $ (31.7 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (31.8 ) Other accrued liabilities 6.5 0.1 6.6 Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer. 8 Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of suc h products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. The se adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in Note 7 Other Accrued Liabilities. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned. In limited circumstances we enter into volume based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine th e expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabiliti es. Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in the periods presented. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $6.4 million and $39.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and $1.1 million and $31.6 million, respectively, as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in Note 7 Other Accrued Liabilities. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.3 million in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by ASC 606-10-50-14, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis. We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the “selling, general and administrative” expense line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment. Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information. 3. Net Income Per Share The computation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Numerator: Net income/(loss) $ 12.8 $ (82.4 ) $ 16.6 $ (108.9 ) Denominator: Shares, basic 34.5 34.1 34.8 33.8 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 0.6 — 0.8 — Shares, diluted 35.1 34.1 35.6 33.8 Net income/(loss) per share: Basic $ 0.37 $ (2.42 ) $ 0.48 $ (3.22 ) Diluted $ 0.36 $ (2.42 ) $ 0.47 $ (3.22 ) 9 Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding over the period measured. Our di luted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We use the “treasury stock” method to determine the dilutive effect of our stock options, deferred stock units, or DSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, and our convertible notes. Dilutive net income per share amounts do not include the potential weighted average effect of 1,736,456 and 3,334,776 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,426,365 and 3,020,056 shares of common stock related to certain share-based awards that were outstanding during the six months ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. 4. Fair Value Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy, consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, June 30, 2018 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Money market funds $ 259.4 $ - $ - $ 275.2 $ - $ - Auction rate securities - - - - - 1.5 Total available-for-sale securities $ 259.4 $ - $ - $ 275.2 $ - $ 1.5 In our condensed consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, money market balances were included in cash and cash equivalents and as of June 30, 2018, auction rate securities, or ARS investments, were included in non-current other assets. During the six months ended December 31, 2018 we converted our ARS investments to senior surplus notes, under an offering memorandum, which also included a receipt of a small amount of cash and warrants. We sold the senior surplus notes during the six months ended December 31, 2018, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million. There were no transfers in or out of our Level 1, 2, or 3 assets during the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. 5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, June 30, 2018 2018 Raw materials and work-in-progress $ 111.8 $ 105.0 Finished goods 33.9 26.2 $ 145.7 $ 131.2 We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. 10 6. Acquired Intangib les and Goodwill Acquired Intangibles The following table summarizes the life, the gross carrying value and the related accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): December 31, 2018 June 30, 2018 Weighted Average Life in Years Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Display driver technology 5.3 $ 164.0 $ (132.2 ) $ 31.8 $ 164.0 $ (116.5 ) $ 47.5 Audio and video technology 5.5 134.1 (35.9 ) 98.2 133.9 (22.8 ) 111.1 Fingerprint authentication technology 4.7 47.2 (47.2 ) - 55.7 (53.7 ) 2.0 Customer relationships 4.1 81.8 (44.2 ) 37.6 81.8 (38.5 ) 43.3 Licensed technology and other 4.2 7.7 (2.6 ) 5.1 9.0 (3.0 ) 6.0 Tradename 7.0 1.8 (0.4 ) 1.4 1.9 (0.2 ) 1.7 Patents 8.1 4.4 (1.8 ) 2.6 4.6 (1.7 ) 2.9 Backlog - - - - 0.5 (0.5 ) - In-process research and development Not applicable 4.5 - 4.5 4.7 - 4.7 Acquired intangibles, gross 5.0 $ 445.5 $ (264.3 ) $ 181.2 $ 456.1 $ (236.9 ) $ 219.2 The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $18.0 million and $23.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $38.0 million and $43.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $15.1 million and $20.3 million, respectively, and $32.1 million and $36.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of amortization expense was included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations in cost of revenue; the remainder was included in acquired intangibles amortization. The following table presents expected annual fiscal year aggregate amortization expense as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Remainder of 2019 $ 36.0 2020 50.5 2021 36.6 2022 32.0 2023 19.5 2024 2.0 Thereafter 0.1 To be determined 4.5 Future amortization $ 181.2 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. There were no changes in our goodwill balance for the six months ended December 31, 2018. 11 7. Other Accrued Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, June 30, 2018 2018 Customer Obligations $ 46.3 $ 26.4 Inventory obligations 30.1 28.8 Warranty 4.1 5.5 Other 11.4 19.0 $ 91.9 $ 79.7 Customer obligations include $6.4 million of contract liabilities and $39.9 million of refund liabilities as of December 31, 2018, as defined under revenue recognition guidance of the new revenue standard (see Note 2 Revenue Recognition). We reclassified certain amounts of incentive items to other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, and presented them as part of customer obligations, from the contra accounts receivable due to the adoption of the new revenue standard . 8. Indemnifications, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Indemnifications In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations. Contingencies We have in the past, and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Legal Proceedings In October 2015, Amkor Technology, or Amkor, filed a complaint against us alleging infringement of intellectual property rights and various other claims. In November 2015, we filed an indemnification claim against the former stockholders and option holders of Validity Sensors, Inc., or Validity, to secure our rights under the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between us and Validity (the “Validity Agreement”). In April 2017, we agreed to settle this case with Amkor on undisclosed terms that include each party licensing and assigning certain intellectual property rights, and cash payments. Settlement costs incurred in connection with this litigation were recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017 and all but an immaterial amount was paid during our fiscal 2017. Pursuant to the Validity Agreement, we offset costs, damages and settlements incurred in connection with our defense and resolution of the complaint with Amkor against the contingent consideration earnout balance of $8.7 million as of June 30, 2018. In September 2018, we entered into a final order settling the indemnification claim against the former stockholders and option holders of Validity under which we retained $1.9 million of the earnout balance and paid the remainder of $6.8 million in October 2018. 9. Debt Convertible Debt Our convertible debt consists of an original $525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting discounts, were $514.5 million. 12 The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year, w hich is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; eq ual in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indeb tedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. As of the issuance date of the Notes, we recorded $82.1 million of the principal amount to equity, representing the debt discount for the difference between our estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 4.39% and the coupon rate of the Notes of 0.50% using a five-year life, which coincides with the term of the Notes. In addition, we allocated the total of $11.1 million of debt issuance costs, consisting of the Initial Purchaser’s discount of $10.5 million and legal, accounting, and printing costs of $579,000, pro rata, to the equity and debt components of the Notes, or $1.9 million and $9.2 million, respectively. The debt discount and the debt issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the Notes are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over five years. The contractual interest expense and amortization of discount on the Notes for the six months ended December 31, 2018, were as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 Interest expense $ 1.3 Amortization of discount and debt issuance costs 8.7 Total interest $ 10.0 The unamortized amounts of the debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Notes as of December 31, 2018 were $6.6 million and $59.0 million, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our prior term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, 13 which includes a $20 million sub limit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principa l amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, there is no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million relating to the revolving credit facility will be amortized over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. As of the end of the quarter, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants. 10. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation and the related tax benefit recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Cost of revenue $ 0.8 $ 0.7 $ 1.7 $ 1.4 Research and development 8.5 9.8 16.8 18.9 Selling, general, and administrative 6.9 7.3 14.4 14.0 Total $ 16.2 $ 17.8 $ 32.9 $ 34.3 Income tax expense/(benefit) on share-based compensation $ 0.3 $ 1.3 $ (2.4 ) $ (2.7 ) Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. 14 Stock Options Stock option activity, including stock options granted, exercised, and forfeited, weighted average exercise prices for stock options outstanding and exercisable, and the aggregate intrinsic value were as follows: Stock Weighted Aggregate Option Average Intrinsic Awards Exercise Value Outstanding Price (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 1,618,209 $ 57.14 Granted - - Exercised (109,254 ) 29.70 Forfeited (38,850 ) 65.48 Balance as of December 31, 2018 1,470,105 58.96 $ 2.2 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 1,345,451 59.37 $ 2.2 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 28, 2018 of $37.14 and excludes the impact of stock options that were not in-the-money. Deferred Stock Units DSU activity, including DSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of DSUs were as follows: Aggregate DSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 1,853,558 Granted 1,167,118 Delivered (640,672 ) Forfeited (177,706 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 2,202,298 $ 81.8 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 28, 2018 of $37.14. Of the shares delivered, 152,845 shares valued at $5.9 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. Market Stock Units Our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of MSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement. We have granted MSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; and the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index, for grants made beginning in fiscal 2018, and relative to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX Index, for grants made prior to fiscal 2018. The potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a two-to-one ratio based on our TSR performance relative to the SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR using the following formula: (100% + ([Synaptics TSR — {SPSISC Index TSR or SOX Index TSR}] x 2)) 15 T he payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100% and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based o n the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of December 31, 2018 was as follows: Aggregate MSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 354,726 Granted 163,059 Performance adjustment (46,663 ) Delivered (92,202 ) Forfeited (14,981 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 363,939 $ 13.5 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 28, 2018 of $37.14. Of the shares delivered, 33,981 shares valued at $1.3 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. We value MSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year performance and service period on a straight-line basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $16.8 million as of December 31, 2018, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.4 years. Performance Stock Units Our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement. We have granted PSUs to our executive officers and other management members, which are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU grant. The grants have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of non-GAAP earnings per share. The potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the grant target quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our non-GAAP earnings per share equals greater than 65% of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 135% of target. 16 Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the employee, consultant, or director after such withholding. Until delivery of share s, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of December 31, 2018 was as follows: Aggregate PSU Intrinsic Awards Value Outstanding (in millions) Balance as of June 30, 2018 294,541 Granted 147,005 Delivered - Forfeited (17,028 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 424,518 $ 15.8 The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on December 28, 2018 of $37.14. We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the date of grant adjusted for estimated performance achievement during the performance period and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding PSUs was approximately $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases during the six-month period ended December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions, except for shares purchased and weighted average price): . Shares purchased 258,563 Weighted average purchase price $ 31.60 Cash received $ 8.2 Aggregate intrinsic value $ 1.4 11. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Act, which significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Act contains broad and complex changes to corporate taxation, including, in part, reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As our accounting and tax year is the fiscal period ending on the last Saturday in June, U.S. federal tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that spans the effective date of a tax rate change to calculate a blended tax rate based on the pro rata number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. As a result, our U.S. federal tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a days-weighted blended tax rate of 28.17%. For fiscal 2019 and subsequent tax years, our U.S. federal tax rate is 21%. In fiscal 2018, we recognized provisional tax expense of $41.4 million, related to the tax impact of the Act, of which an expense of $44.1 million relates to the one-time transition tax and a benefit of $2.7 million relates to remeasurement of deferred tax at the new tax rate. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 foreign earnings and profits, or E&P, which we previously excluded from U.S. income taxes as we considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. The one-time transition tax is applied at a 15.5% tax rate on cash assets and an 8% tax rate for other specified assets. We were able to utilize the research credit carryforward, resulting in a net one-time transition tax impact of $11.9 million on the income tax payable. As of December 31, 2018, based on additional analysis of technical guidance, we recognized a non-discrete tax expense of $1.4 million, which is included in the annual 17 effective tax rate, and a discrete benefit of $0.2 million, both of which relate to the limitation on the deduction of executive’s compensation. Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts and recognize the effect of the tax law during a measurement period. The measurement period ended in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we have finalized our accounting for the tax impact of the Act. However, further technical guidance related to the Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued and, as such, if our interpretation and final accounting are inconsistent with future regulations and guidance we will recognize the impact as a discrete item in the period that such guidance is issued. The Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or GILTI, which is a provision under the Act, imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. GILTI requires an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We elected to treat GILTI as a period cost and recognize the impact in the period when it is incurred. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $7.5 million and $53.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the impact of the one-time transition tax on E&P, the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate on our net deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, partially offset by benefits from research credits. The provision for income taxes of $7.2 million and $56.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess share-based compensation deductions, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the impact of the one-time transition tax on E&P, the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate on our net deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, partially offset by benefits from research credits. The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions decreased $0.1 million during the six months ended December 31, 2018, to $24.7 million from $24.8 million at June 30, 2018, and was included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 were $2.3 million; this balance increased by $0.4 million compared to June 30, 2018. We classify interest and penalties as components of income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months and an estimate of the range of possible changes include an increase in our liability of up to $4.4 million. In July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion. The reconstituted panel has not issued an opinion on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. 18 Our major tax jurisdictions are the United States, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan. From fiscal 2013 o nward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions. In August 2018, we received the revenue agent’s report resolving the fiscal 2014 and 2015 examination with the Internal Revenue Service with no material impact on our consolidat ed financial statements. Our case is pending review by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which we anticipate will conclude in June 2019. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax e xpense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period. 12. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. We generate our revenue from three broad product categories: the mobile product market, the personal computing, or PC, product market, and the Internet of Things product market, or IoT. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services to OEMs. Net revenue within geographic areas based on our customers’ locations for the periods presented was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 China $ 251.7 $ 209.9 $ 479.5 $ 419.7 Japan 78.0 97.3 146.5 188.3 Taiwan 61.0 60.2 137.4 103.3 Other 13.9 21.7 29.3 37.8 South Korea 11.7 12.5 31.8 33.7 United States 9.2 28.8 18.6 65.0 $ 425.5 $ 430.4 $ 843.1 $ 847.8 Net revenue from our customers for each group of similar products was as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Mobile product applications $ 274.4 $ 261.8 $ 537.1 $ 554.7 PC product applications 63.9 61.7 132.5 127.0 IoT product applications 87.2 106.9 173.5 166.1 $ 425.5 $ 430.4 $ 843.1 $ 847.8 Net revenue from major customers as a percentage of total net revenue for the periods presented was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Customer A 20% 12% 19% 15% Customer B 14% * 12% * Customer C * * * 11% Customer D * 12% * 12% * Less than 10% 19 We extend credit based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral. Major customer accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable were as follows: December 31, June 30, 2018 2018 Customer A 22% 10% Customer B 18% 13% Customer C * 11% * Less than 10% 13. Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Our comprehensive income/(loss) generally consists of net income/(loss) plus the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments, primarily due to temporary changes in market value of certain of our ARS investments. In addition, we recognize the noncredit portion of other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in other comprehensive income/(loss). We recognize foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign entities. 14. Restructuring Activities In November 2017, we committed to and initiated a restructuring action intended to streamline and reduce our operating cost structure and capitalize on acquisition synergies. These costs primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount, facility consolidation and related costs. In April 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring to close a research and development facility. These costs included employee severance and related benefits and facility closure charges. Restructuring costs related to the November 2017 and April 2018 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations and are complete as of December 31, 2018. The restructuring liability activities for these fiscal 2018 initiated activities during the six months ended December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance Facility Consolidation and Benefits and Related Charges Total Balance as of June 30, 2018 $ 2.2 $ 0.1 $ 2.3 Accruals 0.2 - 0.2 Cash payments (2.4 ) (0.1 ) (2.5 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ - $ - $ - In August 2018, we committed to and initiated a restructuring of our mobile fingerprint optical business. These costs primarily related to severance costs for a reduction in headcount and related costs. Restructuring costs related to the fiscal 2019 restructuring activities were recorded to the restructuring costs line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations. These activities are complete as of December 31, 2018. The restructuring liability activities for the fiscal 2019 initiated activity during the six months ended December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions): Employee Severance and Benefits Accruals $ 10.4 Cash payments (10.0 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 0.4 20 ITEM 2. M ANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 (this “Report”) contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). For ease of presentation, this Report shows reporting periods ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements may include words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “target,” “strategy,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “should,” variations of such words, or other words and terms of similar meaning. All forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment and are based on several factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risks as identified in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and other risks as identified from time to time in our SEC reports. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we do not have, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly release any updates or any changes in our expectations, or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Statements made in this Report, unless the context otherwise requires, include the use of the terms “us,” “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Synaptics” to refer to Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview We are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We currently generate revenue from the markets for smartphones, tablets, personal computer, or PC, products, primarily notebook computers, Internet of Things, or IoT, which includes devices with voice, speech and video within smart homes, and other select electronic devices, including devices in automobiles, with our custom human interface solutions. Every solution we deliver either contains or consists of our touch-, display driver-, fingerprint authentication-based-, voice and speech-, and video- semiconductor solutions, which include our chip, customer-specific firmware, and software. Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis. Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers’ facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology, backlog, and supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue. Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers’ products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs, and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin. 21 Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives’ commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities. Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations. Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to our restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses. These headcount and facilities related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our convertible notes as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our convertible notes, partially offset by impairment recovery on investments. Equity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets as well as our portion of the net loss reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended December 31, 2018, compared with our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, with the exception to the critical accounting policy on revenue recognition. We adopted the Accounting Standards Update on revenue from contracts with customers at the beginning of our fiscal 2019 (see Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report). 22 Results of Operations Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated, together with comparative absolute and percentage changes in these amounts, were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 (1) 2017 (1) $ Change % Change 2018 (1) 2017 (1) $ Change % Change Mobile product applications $ 274.4 $ 261.8 $ 12.6 4.8 % $ 537.1 $ 554.7 $ (17.6 ) (3.2 %) PC product applications 63.9 61.7 2.2 3.6 % 132.5 127.0 5.5 4.3 % IoT product applications 87.2 106.9 (19.7 ) (18.4 %) 173.5 166.1 7.4 4.5 % Net revenue 425.5 430.4 (4.9 ) (1.1 %) 843.1 847.8 (4.7 ) (0.6 %) Gross margin 149.8 115.2 34.6 30.0 % 290.7 229.6 61.1 26.6 % Operating expenses: Research and development 84.2 92.2 (8.0 ) (8.7 %) 174.3 179.3 (5.0 ) (2.8 %) Selling, general, and administrative 35.6 37.4 (1.8 ) (4.8 %) 69.4 77.7 (8.3 ) (10.7 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 2.9 3.0 (0.1 ) (3.3 %) 5.8 7.1 (1.3 ) (18.3 %) Restructuring costs 2.1 6.6 (4.5 ) (68.2 %) 10.4 6.4 4.0 62.5 % Operating income/(loss) 25.0 (24.0 ) 49.0 204.2 % 30.8 (40.9 ) 71.7 175.3 % Interest and other expense, net (4.3 ) (4.7 ) 0.4 8.5 % (6.2 ) (10.7 ) 4.5 42.1 % Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes 20.7 (28.7 ) 49.4 172.1 % 24.6 (51.6 ) 76.2 147.7 % Provision for income taxes 7.5 53.3 (45.8 ) (85.9 %) 7.2 56.5 (49.3 ) (87.3 %) Equity investment loss (0.4 ) (0.4 ) - - (0.8 ) (0.8 ) - - Net income/(loss) $ 12.8 $ (82.4 ) $ 95.2 115.5 % $ 16.6 $ (108.9 ) $ 125.5 115.2 % (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from our acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC, completed on July 25, 2017, or the Conexant Acquisition, and from our acquisition of the multimedia solutions business of Marvell, completed on September 8, 2017, or the Marvell Business Acquisition. Certain of the data used in our condensed consolidated statements of operations presented here as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated were as follows: Three Months Ended Percentage Point Six Months Ended Percentage Point December 31, Increase/ December 31, Increase/ 2018 (1) 2017 (1) (Decrease) 2018 (1) 2017 (1) (Decrease) Mobile product applications 64.5 % 60.8 % 3.7 % 63.7 % 65.4 % (1.7 %) PC product applications 15.0 % 14.3 % 0.7 % 15.7 % 15.0 % 0.7 % IoT product applications 20.5 % 24.9 % (4.4 %) 20.6 % 19.6 % 1.0 % Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (0.0 %) Gross margin 35.2 % 26.8 % 8.4 % 34.5 % 27.1 % 7.4 % Operating expenses: Research and development 19.8 % 21.4 % (1.6 %) 20.7 % 21.1 % (0.4 %) Selling, general, and administrative 8.4 % 8.7 % (0.3 %) 8.2 % 9.2 % (1.0 %) Acquired intangibles amortization 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.0 % 0.7 % 0.8 % (0.1 %) Restructuring costs 0.5 % 1.5 % (1.0 %) 1.2 % 0.8 % 0.4 % Operating income/(loss) 5.9 % (5.6 %) 11.5 % 3.7 % (4.8 %) 8.5 % Interest and other expense, net (1.0 %) (1.1 %) 0.1 % (0.7 %) (1.3 %) 0.6 % Income/(loss) before provision for income taxes 4.9 % (6.7 %) 11.6 % 2.9 % (6.1 %) 9.0 % Provision for income taxes 1.8 % 12.4 % (10.6 %) 0.9 % 6.7 % (5.8 %) Equity investment loss (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % (0.1 %) (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net income/(loss) 3.0 % (19.1 %) 22.1 % 2.0 % (12.8 %) 14.8 % (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from the Conexant Acquisition, completed on July 25, 2017, and from the Marvell Business Acquisition, completed on September 8, 2017. 23 Net Revenue Net revenue was $425.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared with $430.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 1.1%. Of this net revenue, $274.4 million, or 64.5%, was from Mobile product applications, $87.2 million, or 20.5%, was from IoT product applications, and $63.9 million, or 15.0%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in IoT product applications, partially offset by an increase in net revenue from Mobile product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from IoT product applications decreased as a result of lower average selling prices for IoT product applications (which decreased 17.2%) as well as a decline in units sold (which decreased 1.5%). Net revenue from Mobile product applications increased as a result of higher average selling prices for Mobile product applications (which increased 24.8%), partially offset by a decline in units sold (which decreased 16.0%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased due to higher average selling prices for PC product applications (which increased 22.0%), partially offset by a decline in units sold (which decreased 15.1%). Net revenue was $843.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 compared with $847.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.7 million, or 0.6%. Of this net revenue, $537.1 million, or 63.7%,was from Mobile product applications, $173.5 million, or 20.6%, was from IoT product applications, and $132.5 million, or 15.7%, was from PC product applications. The decrease in net revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2018, was attributable to a decrease in net revenue from Mobile product applications, partially offset by an increase in IoT product applications and PC product applications. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased as a result of a decline in units sold (which decreased 20.7%), partially offset by higher average selling prices for mobile product applications (which increased 22.2%). Net revenue from IoT product applications increased primarily as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 15.1%), partially offset by lower average selling prices (which decreased 9.3%). Net revenue from PC product applications increased as a result of higher average selling prices (which increased 18.3%), partially offset by a decline in units sold (which decreased 11.8%). Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 35.2%, or $149.8 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared with 26.8%, or $115.2 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34.5%, or $290.7, for the six months ended December 31, 2018, compared with 27.1%, or $229.6 for the six months ended December 31, 2017. The 840 basis point increase and the 740 basis point increase in gross margin for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, was primarily due to a reduction of inventory fair value adjustments recorded in the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 of $18.2 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively, associated with two acquisitions and a favorable mix, including IoT product applications which have higher gross margins. There were no inventory fair value adjustments recorded in the three and six months ended December 31, 2018. We continually introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product-specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased $8.0 million to $84.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $4.9 million decrease in personnel-related costs which is a result of a decrease in average headcount for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017, as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $1.7 million decrease in supplies and project specific costs; and a $1.1 million decrease in facilities and infrastructure related costs. Research and development expenses decreased $5.0 million to $174.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018, compared with the six months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $4.9 million decrease in personnel-related costs which is a result of a decrease in average headcount for the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2017, as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $4.1 million decrease in supplies and project specific costs; a $1.0 million decrease in facilities and infrastructure related costs; partially offset by a $5.3 increase in software licensing and intellectual property costs. 24 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million to $35 .6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $2.8 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which is due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our recent restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; partially offset by a $0.7 million write-off of an acquisition-based receivable. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $8.3 million to $69.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018, compared with the six months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $6.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs, which is primarily due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce operating costs; a $1.6 million, net, reversal of an accrual for payroll deposit penalties, which were previously accrued and have been reversed due to the completion of a payroll tax audit; and a $1.3 million reduction in professional fees; partially offset by a $0.7 million write-off of an indemnity receivable from a prior acquisition which will not be pursued. Acquired intangibles amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through acquisitions. For further discussion of acquired intangibles amortization, see Note 6 Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill included in the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Restructuring costs. Restructuring costs of $10.4 million in the six months ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflect severance costs for restructuring of our operations to reduce ongoing operating costs which commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The restructuring activities are complete as of December 31, 2018. See Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report. Interest and other expense, net . Interest and other expense, net primarily includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, as well as interest on our debt. The $4.5 million decrease in interest and other expense, net to$6.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2017, is primarily due to a $2.8 million impairment recovery on investments as well as a $1.0 million reduction of amortization of debt issuance costs in the six months ended December 31, 2018 for a term loan which was paid down and closed in the prior fiscal year. See Liquidity and Capital Resources included in the next section of this Report. Provision for Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Act, which significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Act contains broad and complex changes to corporate taxation, including, in part, reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As our accounting and tax year is the fiscal period ending on the last Saturday in June, U.S. federal tax law requires that taxpayers with a fiscal year that spans the effective date of a tax rate change to calculate a blended tax rate based on the pro rata number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. As a result, our U.S. federal tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a days-weighted blended tax rate of 28.17%. For fiscal 2019 and subsequent tax years, our U.S. federal tax rate is 21%. In fiscal 2018, we recognized provisional tax expense of $41.4 million, related to the tax impact of the Act, of which an expense of $44.1 million relates to the one-time transition tax and a benefit of $2.7 million relates to remeasurement of deferred tax at the new tax rate. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 foreign earnings and profits, or E&P, which we previously excluded from U.S. income taxes as we considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. The one-time transition tax is applied at a 15.5% tax rate on cash assets and an 8% tax rate for other specified assets. We were able to utilize the research credit carryforward, resulting in a net one-time transition tax impact of $11.9 million on the income tax payable. As of December 31, 2018, based on additional analysis of technical guidance, we recognized a non-discrete tax expense of $1.4 million, which is included in the annual effective tax rate, and a discrete benefit of $0.2 million, both of which relate to the limitation on the deduction of executive’s compensation. Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts and recognize the effect of the tax law during a measurement period. The measurement period ended in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we have finalized our accounting for the tax impact of the Act. However, further technical guidance related to the Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued and, as such, if our interpretation and final accounting are inconsistent with future regulations and guidance we will recognize the impact as a discrete item in the period that such guidance is issued. 25 The Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or GILTI, which is a provision under the Act, imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. GILTI requires an accounting policy election of either (1) tre ating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We elected to treat GILTI as a period cost and recognize the impact in the period when it is incurred. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes recorded in interim periods is recorded by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income before provision for income taxes, excluding the effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items. The tax effects of discrete items are recorded in the same period that the related discrete items are reported and results in a difference between the actual effective tax rate and the estimated annual effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes of $7.5 million and $53.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily because of foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the impact of the one-time transition tax on E&P, the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate on our net deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, partially offset by benefits from research credits. The provision for income taxes of $7.2 million and $56.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign, and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2018, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of net shortfalls in share-based compensation deductions, and GILTI, partially offset by the benefit of research credits, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, excess share-based compensation deductions, release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017, diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate, primarily because of the impact of the one-time transition tax on E&P, the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate on our net deferred tax assets, foreign withholding taxes, nondeductible amortization, the impact of accounting for qualified stock options, and foreign income taxed at higher tax rates, partially offset by benefits from research credits. In July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion. The reconstituted panel has not issued an opinion on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the Treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents were $283.0 million as of December 31, 2018, compared with $301.0 million as of June 30, 2018, a decrease of $18.0 million. The decrease primarily reflected the combination of $77.3 million used to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock; $11.2 million used for the purchase of property and equipment; partially offset by $63.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities. At this time, we consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax described above under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Provision for Income Taxes,” that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of December 31, 2018, $235.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2018 generated $63.5 million compared with $103.2 million net cash generated during the six months ended December 31, 2017. For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $90.9 million, partially offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $44.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $31.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $14.5 million increase in inventories, and a $6.8 million reduction in acquisition related obligations, partially offset by a $19.5 million 26 increase in accounts payable, and a $6.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities. From June 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018, our days sales outstanding increased from 67 days to 69 days due to a larger percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the December 31, 2018 quarter compared with a smaller percentage of the quarter’s net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2018 quarter. Our annual inventory turns remained at seven. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, the primary operating activities were adjustments for non-cash charges of $131.1 million, an $81.0 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by net loss of $108.9 million. The net chang e in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $70.1 million increase in inventory; a $30.0 million increase in accounts receivable, net; an $18.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $7.6 million increase in income taxes payable; partially offset by a $27.6 million decrease in accounts payable; a $6.6 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and $5.4 million decrease in accrued compensation. From June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017, our days sales outs tanding decreased from 54 days to 49 days. Our annual inventory turns decreased from nine to eight due to the additional inventory acquired in recent acquisitions, including the fair value adjustment recorded as part of the purchase accounting for such acq uisitions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $11.2 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds from sales of investments. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $395.9 million used for the acquisition of businesses, $19.5 million for the purchase of property and equipment, and $7.7 million for the purchase of intangible assets. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was $73.1 million compared with $204.4 million provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to $77.3 million used to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to $514.5 million of proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, partially offset by $220.0 million used for the payment of debt, and $93.6 million used to repurchase 1,698,400 shares of our common stock. Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2018, our board has cumulatively authorized $1.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2019. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through December 31, 2018, we purchased 29,489,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. Treasury shares purchased prior to August 28, 2008 were not subject to the stock split on that date. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 1,850,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $77.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining available authorization under our common stock repurchase program is $148.8 million. Convertible Debt On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts, were $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the Initial Purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, retire our outstanding bank debt, and provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant Acquisition and Marvell Business Acquisition. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances. 27 On or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may con vert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, or the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022 and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million are amortizing over 60 months. Our obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties’ direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. Under the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. $100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares will generally be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the 28 Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acqu ired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, and our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, but if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to accrue and pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions): Remaining in Fiscal Year 2019 Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (1) $ 1.3 $ 2.6 $ 2.6 $ 527.6 $ - $ - $ - $ 534.1 Leases 3.5 4.9 2.7 0.6 0.3 0.1 - 12.1 Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) 41.9 15.8 5.6 - - - - 63.3 Transition tax payable (3) - 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.8 5.1 10.9 Total $ 46.7 $ 24.3 $ 11.9 $ 529.2 $ 1.3 $ 1.9 $ 5.1 $ 620.4 (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. (3) Represents the tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Act into law on December 22, 2017. The amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of $22.4 million. As of December 31, 2018, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit. 29 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standard Update on Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. It also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 30 ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December 31, 2018, our market risk related to interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, and foreign currency exchange risks has not changed materially from the risks disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Variable Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2018, there is no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement, which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 31 PA RT II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

For further information regarding current legal proceedings, see Note 8 Indemnifications, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report.
