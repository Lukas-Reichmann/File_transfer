MANPOWERGROUP INC. Dated: October 19, 2023 By: /s/ John T. McGinnis Name: John T. McGinnis Title: Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -;-EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Nick Hengst +1.414.906.7356 nicholas.hengst@manpowergroup.com ManpowerGroup Reports 3 rd Quarter 2023 Results MILWAUKEE, October 19, 2023 -- ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) today reported net earnings of $0.60 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $2.13 per diluted share in the prior year period. Net earnings in the quarter were $30.3 million compared to $111.3 million a year earlier. Revenues for the third quarter were $4.7 billion, a 3% decrease from the prior year period. The current year quarter included restructuring costs, a small loss from the sale of our Philippines business and Argentina related non-cash currency translation losses which reduced earnings per share by $0.78 in the current quarter. Excluding these costs, earnings per share was $1.38 per diluted share in the quarter representing a decrease of 39% in constant currency. [1] Argentina is required to be treated as a hyperinflationary economy and the currency translation losses reflect the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. Financial results in the quarter were also impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies compared to the prior year period, resulting in a 4 cent positive impact to earnings per share in the quarter compared to the prior year. The foreign currency positive impact to earnings per share was 4 cents lower than the impact anticipated in our third quarter guidance. On a constant currency basis, revenues decreased 5% compared to the prior year period. [1] The prior year period included integration costs from the U.S. Experis acquisition which reduced earnings per share by $0.08 which are also excluded when determining the year over year trend. Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup Chairman & CEO, said, “Our third quarter results reflect the challenging operating environment for recruitment and resourcing in North America and Europe. We continued to see solid demand across Latin America and Asia Pacific Middle East. While the current operating environment is difficult for our industry, we are confident in our ability to adjust to the existing reality while being ready to pivot quickly when the situation improves. We executed various additional cost actions during the third quarter and our experienced management team continues to drive our key Diversification, Digitization and Innovation initiatives which are strengthening ManpowerGroup for the future. We anticipate diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter will be between $1.17 and $1.27, which includes an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 1 cent. Our guidance excludes expected restructuring costs and any Argentina related impact of non-cash currency translation losses.” Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $173.3 million, or net earnings of $3.42 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $325.1 million, or net earnings of $6.10 per diluted share in the prior year, respectively. The current year to date period included restructuring costs, a small loss from the sale of our Philippines business and an Argentina related non-cash currency translation losses which reduced earnings per share by $1.16. Excluding the net impact of these charges, earnings per share for the nine-month period was $4.58 per diluted share representing a decrease of 27% in constant currency. [2] Revenues for the nine-month period were $14.3 billion, representing a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year or a decrease of 4% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the nine-month period were negatively impacted by 14 cents due to changes in foreign currencies compared to the prior year. In conjunction with its third quarter earnings release, ManpowerGroup will broadcast its conference call live over the Internet on October 19, 2023 at 7:30 a.m. central time (8:30 a.m. eastern time). Prepared remarks for the conference call, webcast details, presentation and recordings are included within the Investor Relations section of manpowergroup.com. Supplemental financial information referenced in the conference call can be found at http://investor.manpowergroup.com/ . [2] The prior year period included integration costs from the U.S. Experis acquisition and the net loss related to the sale of our Russia business which reduced earnings per share by $0.33 which are also excluded when determining the year over year trend.

MANPOWERGROUP INC. Dated: October 19, 2023 By: /s/ John T. McGinnis Name: John T. McGinnis Title: Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ","EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Nick Hengst +1.414.906.7356 nicholas.hengst@manpowergroup.com ManpowerGroup Reports 3 rd Quarter 2023 Results MILWAUKEE, October 19, 2023 -- ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) today reported net earnings of $0.60 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $2.13 per diluted share in the prior year period. Net earnings in the quarter were $30.3 million compared to $111.3 million a year earlier. Revenues for the third quarter were $4.7 billion, a 3% decrease from the prior year period. The current year quarter included restructuring costs, a small loss from the sale of our Philippines business and Argentina related non-cash currency translation losses which reduced earnings per share by $0.78 in the current quarter. Excluding these costs, earnings per share was $1.38 per diluted share in the quarter representing a decrease of 39% in constant currency. [1] Argentina is required to be treated as a hyperinflationary economy and the currency translation losses reflect the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. Financial results in the quarter were also impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies compared to the prior year period, resulting in a 4 cent positive impact to earnings per share in the quarter compared to the prior year. The foreign currency positive impact to earnings per share was 4 cents lower than the impact anticipated in our third quarter guidance. On a constant currency basis, revenues decreased 5% compared to the prior year period. [1] The prior year period included integration costs from the U.S. Experis acquisition which reduced earnings per share by $0.08 which are also excluded when determining the year over year trend. Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup Chairman & CEO, said, “Our third quarter results reflect the challenging operating environment for recruitment and resourcing in North America and Europe. We continued to see solid demand across Latin America and Asia Pacific Middle East. While the current operating environment is difficult for our industry, we are confident in our ability to adjust to the existing reality while being ready to pivot quickly when the situation improves. We executed various additional cost actions during the third quarter and our experienced management team continues to drive our key Diversification, Digitization and Innovation initiatives which are strengthening ManpowerGroup for the future. We anticipate diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter will be between $1.17 and $1.27, which includes an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 1 cent. Our guidance excludes expected restructuring costs and any Argentina related impact of non-cash currency translation losses.” Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $173.3 million, or net earnings of $3.42 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $325.1 million, or net earnings of $6.10 per diluted share in the prior year, respectively. The current year to date period included restructuring costs, a small loss from the sale of our Philippines business and an Argentina related non-cash currency translation losses which reduced earnings per share by $1.16. Excluding the net impact of these charges, earnings per share for the nine-month period was $4.58 per diluted share representing a decrease of 27% in constant currency. [2] Revenues for the nine-month period were $14.3 billion, representing a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year or a decrease of 4% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the nine-month period were negatively impacted by 14 cents due to changes in foreign currencies compared to the prior year. In conjunction with its third quarter earnings release, ManpowerGroup will broadcast its conference call live over the Internet on October 19, 2023 at 7:30 a.m. central time (8:30 a.m. eastern time).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In evaluating its business, Synaptics considers and uses Non-GAAP Net Income, which we define as net income excluding share-based compensation, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance as a supplemental measure of operating performance. Non-GAAP Net Income is not a measurement of the companys financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income. The company presents Non-GAAP Net Income because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance since it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences in net income caused by the existence and timing of share-based compensation charges, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items. Non-GAAP Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys GAAP net income. The principal limitations of this measure are that it does not reflect the companys actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its net income and net income per share as compared to its operating results reported under GAAP. As presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables that follow, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items: Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs primarily consist of: amortization of purchased intangibles, which includes acquired intangibles such as developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog, licensed technology, patents, and in-process technology when post-acquisition development is determined to be substantively complete, inventory adjustments affecting the carrying value of inventory acquired in an acquisition, transitory post-acquisition incentive programs negotiated in connection with an acquired business or designed to encourage post-acquisition retention of key employees, and legal and consulting costs associated with acquisitions that have been announced, including non-recurring post-acquisition costs and services. These acquisition related costs are not factored into the companys evaluation of its ongoing business operating performance or potential acquisitions, as they are not considered as part of the companys principal operations. Further, the amount of these costs can vary significantly from period to period based on the terms of an earn-out arrangement, revisions to assumptions that went into developing the estimate of the contingent consideration associated with an earn-out arrangement, the size and timing of an acquisition, the lives assigned to the acquired intangible assets, and the maturity of the business acquired. Excluding acquisition related costs from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability and potential earnings volatility associated with purchase accounting and acquisition related items. Share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense relates to employee equity award programs and the vesting of the underlying awards, which includes stock options, deferred stock units, market stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond the companys control. As a result, the company excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for share-based compensation provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of peer companies without the variability created by share-based compensation resulting from the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used. Restructuring costs. Restructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance and office closure costs, including the reversal of such costs. These costs are cash-based and designed to address cost structure inefficiencies. As a result, the company excludes restructuring costs from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for restructuring costs provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by restructuring costs designed to address cost structure inefficiencies in its business. Retention program costs. Retention program costs consist of employee retention arrangement costs designed to ensure operational continuity and support through employee retention. These costs are cash-based and designed to ensure retention of certain key engineering and management employees as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. As a result, the company excludes retention program costs from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for retention program costs provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by retention program costs designed to ensure operational continuity and support through employee retention during a transition of senior level management and product focus changes. Other non-cash items. Other non-cash items includes non-cash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. These items are excluded from non-GAAP results as they are non-cash. Excluding other non-cash items from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability associated with other non-cash items. Recovery on sale of investment. Recovery on sale of investment, represents the gain on the recovery of an investment in which the cost basis was previously written down to fair value. This item is excluded from non-GAAP results as the previous write-down was excluded from non-GAAP results. Excluding recovery on sale of investment from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability associated with recovery on sale of investment. Arbitration settlement, net Arbitration settlement, net represents the impact of the settlement of an arbitration matter net of related legal and consulting services that is unusual or infrequent. As a result, the company excludes from its internal operating forecasts and models, when evaluating its ongoing business performance, arbitration settlement amounts net of related costs. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting an adjustment for arbitration settlements net of related costs provides investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by infrequent, non-recurring or non-routine arbitration settlements net of related costs. Equity investment loss. Equity investment loss represents an adjustment in the book value of an equity investment in a minority owned company. The equity investment loss is a non-cash item. As a result, the company excludes equity investment loss from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for equity investment loss provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by non-cash items. Non-GAAP tax adjustments. The company forecasts its long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide investors with improved long-term modeling accuracy and consistency across financial reporting periods by eliminating the effects of certain items in our Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per share, including the type and amount of deductible stock options, delivery of shares under deferred stock unit awards, market stock unit awards, and performance stock unit awards, the taxation of post-acquisition intercompany intellectual property cross-licensing or transfer transactions, and the impact of other acquisition items that may or may not be tax deductible. The company intends to evaluate its long-term non-GAAP tax rate annually for significant events, including material tax law changes in the major tax jurisdictions in which the company operates, corporate organizational changes related to acquisitions or tax planning opportunities, and substantive changes in our geographic earnings mix.

Safe Harbor Statement Non-GAAP Results •In evaluating our business, we consider and use non-GAAP net income, which we define as net income excluding share-based compensation, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance as a supplemental measure of operating performance. •Non-GAAP net income is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income. We present non-GAAP net income because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance since it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences in net income caused by the existence and timing of share-based compensation charges, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items. •Non-GAAP net income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP net income. The principal limitations of this measure are that it does not reflect our actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating our net income and net income per share as compared to our operating results reported under GAAP. •Please see our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 press release for additional discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial measures, and the tables attached to the end of this presentation for a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In evaluating its business, Synaptics considers and uses Non-GAAP Net Income, which we define as net income excluding share-based compensation, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance as a supplemental measure of operating performance. Non-GAAP Net Income is not a measurement of the companys financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income. The company presents Non-GAAP Net Income because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance since it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences in net income caused by the existence and timing of share-based compensation charges, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items. Non-GAAP Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys GAAP net income. The principal limitations of this measure are that it does not reflect the companys actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its net income and net income per share as compared to its operating results reported under GAAP. As presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables that follow, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items: Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs primarily consist of: amortization of purchased intangibles, which includes acquired intangibles such as developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog, licensed technology, patents, and in-process technology when post-acquisition development is determined to be substantively complete, inventory adjustments affecting the carrying value of inventory acquired in an acquisition, transitory post-acquisition incentive programs negotiated in connection with an acquired business or designed to encourage post-acquisition retention of key employees, and legal and consulting costs associated with acquisitions that have been announced, including non-recurring post-acquisition costs and services. These acquisition related costs are not factored into the companys evaluation of its ongoing business operating performance or potential acquisitions, as they are not considered as part of the companys principal operations. Further, the amount of these costs can vary significantly from period to period based on the terms of an earn-out arrangement, revisions to assumptions that went into developing the estimate of the contingent consideration associated with an earn-out arrangement, the size and timing of an acquisition, the lives assigned to the acquired intangible assets, and the maturity of the business acquired. Excluding acquisition related costs from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability and potential earnings volatility associated with purchase accounting and acquisition related items. Share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense relates to employee equity award programs and the vesting of the underlying awards, which includes stock options, deferred stock units, market stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond the companys control. As a result, the company excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for share-based compensation provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of peer companies without the variability created by share-based compensation resulting from the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used. Restructuring costs. Restructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance and office closure costs, including the reversal of such costs. These costs are cash-based and designed to address cost structure inefficiencies. As a result, the company excludes restructuring costs from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for restructuring costs provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by restructuring costs designed to address cost structure inefficiencies in its business. Retention program costs. Retention program costs consist of employee retention arrangement costs designed to ensure operational continuity and support through employee retention. These costs are cash-based and designed to ensure retention of certain key engineering and management employees as we transition the company through senior level management and product focus changes. As a result, the company excludes retention program costs from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for retention program costs provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by retention program costs designed to ensure operational continuity and support through employee retention during a transition of senior level management and product focus changes. Other non-cash items. Other non-cash items includes non-cash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. These items are excluded from non-GAAP results as they are non-cash. Excluding other non-cash items from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability associated with other non-cash items. Recovery on sale of investment. Recovery on sale of investment, represents the gain on the recovery of an investment in which the cost basis was previously written down to fair value. This item is excluded from non-GAAP results as the previous write-down was excluded from non-GAAP results. Excluding recovery on sale of investment from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability associated with recovery on sale of investment. Arbitration settlement, net Arbitration settlement, net represents the impact of the settlement of an arbitration matter net of related legal and consulting services that is unusual or infrequent. As a result, the company excludes from its internal operating forecasts and models, when evaluating its ongoing business performance, arbitration settlement amounts net of related costs. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting an adjustment for arbitration settlements net of related costs provides investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by infrequent, non-recurring or non-routine arbitration settlements net of related costs. Equity investment loss. Equity investment loss represents an adjustment in the book value of an equity investment in a minority owned company. The equity investment loss is a non-cash item. As a result, the company excludes equity investment loss from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for equity investment loss provide investors with a basis to compare the companys principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by non-cash items. Non-GAAP tax adjustments. The company forecasts its long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide investors with improved long-term modeling accuracy and consistency across financial reporting periods by eliminating the effects of certain items in our Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per share, including the type and amount of deductible stock options, delivery of shares under deferred stock unit awards, market stock unit awards, and performance stock unit awards, the taxation of post-acquisition intercompany intellectual property cross-licensing or transfer transactions, and the impact of other acquisition items that may or may not be tax deductible. The company intends to evaluate its long-term non-GAAP tax rate annually for significant events, including material tax law changes in the major tax jurisdictions in which the company operates, corporate organizational changes related to acquisitions or tax planning opportunities, and substantive changes in our geographic earnings mix.
